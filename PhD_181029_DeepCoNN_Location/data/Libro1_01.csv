4648,tt0068646,a15haddad,united states,10,Quite possibly the greatest motion picture ever made,"The Godfather. So much praise has been showered upon it, forming a large mountain of critical excellence. It is almost difficult to quantify how many levels this movie succeeds on. I hesitate to even call this a ""movie"" because it is from the time when a movie was an artform. Sadly, these movies are now a dying breed. The Godfather is THE PINNACLE of excellence on the big screen.   You all know that it is a story of the Corleone Family, a large Sicilian Mafia syndicate living in New York and led by Vito Corleone, who is played perfectly by Marlon Brando (I will talk about this a bit later), a powerful Don who demands respect and friendship and offers favors in return. No movie has come close to this one in giving a portrait to organized crime. Not in terms of pure realism or insight, understand. Goodfellas, a great movie in its own right, is a much more realistic story of the way gangsters operate. The Godfather is a glorified Sicilian Mafia tale spun by Mario Puzo and later translated to film by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola, showing the near fall from power of the family.   The Godfather portrays so many different moral questions and considerations: how can power corrupt a man, how things look from different perspectives, is a man allowed to live outside of society, can a man reject society without punishment and live by his own laws, should someone be true to their family or to society, and much more. The result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.  To be fair, a healthy portion of this movie's outward success is due to its acting. Never before and never again has there been such a powerful joint acting performance. It's almost insane to think about how amazing it was, how amazing and influential this entire movie is. Most great movies have one memorable acting performance, two if they are lucky. Four actors- Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall- are best known for their work in the Godfather, the latter three using this title as a springboard to fame. All four acting performances, playing Vito, Michael, and Sonny Corleone plus the Consigliere Tom Hagen, are among the best ever. Along with this, Vito Corleone is probably the most prominent figure in the public's mind when it comes to movies. His raspy voice has become the stuff of legends, and has been imitated by almost everyone at one point or another.   Here I will explain why classic movies in general are far superior to today's critical masterpieces. Many people find the Godfather too slow for their tastes. While opinions are different and I do not get mad at people who find other great movies to be superior to the Godfather, people who ridicule this film to be outwardly slow quite frankly do not have long enough attention spans. This is an epic. we are talking slow corruption for maximum effect. Slow unfolding to make it seem more real, not sudden jerks of the plot but carefully constructed twists that are slowly built up and make perfect sense upon further thought. Not to mention that the cinematography is absolutely chilling. Watch the baptism scene and you will know what I mean.  This motion picture also features what is considered by many as the single most powerful scene in movie history- I won't spoil anything, but you will know it when you see it. Not to mention the wonderful soundtrack, an instantly memorable score that does a lot to help the film.  But by saying that I betray the true beauty of this film. The most prominent reason for this movie's place at the top of the all-time greats is that most movies have a few scenes that stand out when you remember them. Everybody immediately knows what they are afterward. Empire Strikes Back has the final battle with Vader. Rocky has the run up the steps. All of these are obvious. But, while perhaps the scene mentioned above is a bit more prominent, every single scene is done with such consistency and perfection. Coppola is simply a genius, or at least was in the 1970s. There are absolutely no hitches in the screenplay. Every scene is equally intense. But the paradox of this is that not only will you be hanging on to every word and totally absorbed into the story your first time, The Godfather gets better every time you watch it! The first time I saw this, I had not been as exposed to the greatest movies ever. I didn't truly understand all the moral depths of this story, but I still thought it amazing simply for the intensity of the scenes, plot, and the wonderful balance between the characters. However, after watching it dozens of times afterward I now understand all of the tiny stuff in the plot that make it what it truly is. All of the quotes and tiny little things about it are simply fantastic. Once again, in this space I cannot explain all of the greatness. I have not even gotten into the plot. To close, every single thing about this movie just absolutely screams quality. It's hard to find any significant weaknesses with this film, except that unlike the book it does not show the perspective from an outsider's point of view, such as the novel did with Kay Adams. But that is simply a tiny nitpick that we would not mention about any other movie. The effort put into everything else is what makes this visible. Everything else- perfection. If you have not seen The Godfather, DO SO NOW! It will stimulate your mind and emotions like no other movie ever filmed before. This is simply the quintessential film experience. 9.8.

5621,tt0071562,a15haddad,united states,9,The greatest sequel ever?  Absolutely,"The Godfather: Part II came out in 1974 with incredible hype, but when it first was released it was labeled a disappointment. Only a few months later, however, it could be heard among many a debate that this movie was superior to the original.   The plot is arguably even more intense and chilling and, unlike its predecessor, it tells two tales: one of how Michael Corleone tightens his grip on the criminal underworld in the late 1950s and another of the beginnings of his father, Vito, this time played by Robert De Niro to outstanding effect, and his business empire. It is this near-seamless change that propels The Godfather: Part II into the discussion of the greatest movies ever, where it belongs right there with the first.   Al Pacino returns as Michael Corleone and this time plays him even better. On top of that, De Niro, in the role that made him famous, is sublime as Vito. While De Niro's performance is not as memorable as Marlon Brando's and his character not quite as endearing, it is still one of the highlights in the history of acting in the cinema. It's sad that when most people today think of De Niro it is for his performances in Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas, or, God forbid, 21st century comedies like Showtime or Analyze This. It's simply amazing that the Holy Trinity of modern American actors- Brando, Pacino, and De Niro, in that order- all were stars in the first two Godfather pictures, and the first two's careers are still highlighted by it.  However, I do not find this film to be on the exact same level as the original for a variety of reasons. Make no mistake, this is an outstanding film in its own right, the best sequel ever, and the praise I could give it is very similar to the praise I give The Godfather for it's consistent brilliance and masterful direction. Never before have I seen a pair of films that are so beautifully orchestrated. But unlike its predecessor this movie has a couple flaws.  The biggest one is with the Vito Corleone section. In the book, this part is detailed from Vito's birth right up to the events in the Godfather. However, here it only goes to about a Roosevelt administration away from the start of the events detailed in The Godfather. For someone who has only watched the movies this is a huge chunk of backstory that is missing. While Coppola chose to focus on the Don Fanucci part of Vito's epic tale, there is so much more of this brilliant story that is left untold. If an entire movie was centered around this, then the pace this story takes would be perfect. But this is but a part of The Godfather: Part II. You cannot tell two epics in one movie, and there is simply not enough time at this pace to cap off the story satisfyingly. The current model speaks nothing of the war that brought Don Corleone to power.   Not only that, but literally EVERY SINGLE PERSON in this tale is Italian and speaks Italian. I understand how large Little Italy was at this time but are you telling me that Vito in his time does not meet one pure American? Is his life that secluded? Once again, I understand the message that Coppola is getting across just fine, the sense of unity and family the Italians have, much like the first one, but it's done less believably here. It's also a bit harder to relate to Italian dialect.  The majority of my complaints lie on the Vito tale. The tale involving Michael Corleone is absolutely compelling. Emphasize that as much as possible. It's arguably more thought-provoking than its predecessor, and I would say it is more chilling, with a few parts that will absolutely make your jaw drop. That's one thing about the original, it did not have too many of those moments, but this movie has them in abundance. And not to mention Al Pacino makes these scenes come alive, he is just so fearsome and intimidating when provoked. However, surprisingly, many important plot mechanics of this movie are things you might not pick up your first time through. The major plot dynamic of the original was the transition between Vito Corleone as the Don of the Corleone family to Michael Corleone. In this movie the major mechanic is Michael's relationship with Fredo. It is this that represents the film's greatest intellectual stimulation and chill. Especially the ending, which is among the most haunting and memorable scenes you shall ever see, up there with the original's baptism. It has a bit more closure than that of its predecessor. Still, when I think of The Godfather, I think of Marlon Brando rasping out memorable lines, of Don Barzini falling down the steps, of Michael Corleone shooting Virgil Solozzo in a restaurant. It is only after this that I remember the famous aspects of The Godfather: Part II. The most likely reason for this is that it is a sequel, and we always remember what we saw first. Still, something about this movie is not quite as memorable. It lacks that extra something that made The Godfather so unique. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. It certainly has better cinematography than the original, some of the best I've seen. But it is less than it's original: just barely, but still less. Somehow the plot is just not as large or alive, the scenes not as enjoyable. Don't take this out of context: this movie still has the magic. It has moral considerations and character depth just like the original, this time mostly about the damnation of Michael. Do not let comparisons distract you from the spectacle. 9.4.

72529,tt0033467,a15haddad,United States,10,A monument to film that will live forever,"Citizen Kane. Here is a movie that has been almost universally acclaimed by every expert worth his salt as the greatest of all-time. The American Film Institute chose it. On the Sight and Sound Poll it was a near unanimous choice. Yet there is still a very large amount of people who have not seen this movie. It's not as mainstream of a Best Movie Ever as, say, The Godfather, but still this is inexcusable. The most likely reason for this is that Citizen Kane is a black-and-white film from 1941. This may turn off modern movie-goers but not me. Convinced that the Godfather was the greatest movie ever and wanting to see for myself if Citizen Kane was as good as people claimed, I rented it just yesterday, February 28. Let me just say the first word that comes to my mind. Wow. I'll say it again. Wow. Here is a movie that is over 60 years old, from the year America went into World War II. This film came out before Pearl Harbor, when Adolf Hitler was Fuehrer of Germany. Yet its direction is still unparalleled in the industry. The main reason for Citizen Kane's place in movie expert's hearts is for its insanely innovative technical prowess. It is almost impossible to explain just how revolutionary this direction is. Just about every movie since Citizen Kane has taken something from this movie. Yet it is still the golden light among movie direction. I was so stunned watching this film. Despite all the technical limitations of his time, despite the very simple methods of making movies that were prominent in the early 1900s, this film is so technically perfect that it is impossible for any reasonable man to deny its place among the very, very greatest movies ever. I just cannot explain in this space the perfection of this movie's direction. Orson Welles is an absolute genius when it comes to the cinema. And apparently, not only did Welles orchestrate the technically finest film ever made, he is also a superb actor! Watching this movie I was immensely impressed with Charles Foster Kane and the actor who immortalized him. The entire time I was thinking, who could this be? I concentrated during the credits and found out that Orson Welles himself played the star in his signature movie. This is honestly one of the best acting performances I've ever seen, and Kane is the most memorable character this side of Vito Corleone I've ever met in my experiences with the cinema. Charles Foster Kane was a world-famous newspaper tycoon, the most powerful media puppetmaster America had ever known. It is generally accepted that this character was based off of William Randolph Hurst, but that's beside the point. When he died in 1941 with his empire in shambles, he uttered one last word before falling. ""Rosebud."" One reporter is assigned to find out what this word meant. To do so he interviews the most central figures in Kane's life. It is through this story that the movie comes alive. Through this Welles displays all sorts of flashbacks, which are essentially the movie itself, of Kane's life. All of the important chapters in his saga are covered in an attempt to find out what Rosebud really means. In the process, we see a frighteningly deep display into a man who got everything he wanted in life and then subsequently lost it, his lust for material possessions to replace something else he had lost, his determination to have everything he desired what drove him through life. This all culminates in the ending which has to rank as the greatest and most thought-provoking I've ever seen. It is this ending that pieces together the puzzle of Kane's life and his struggle. It lays everything to rest, and at the end there is not one stone unturned. The ending makes everything make sense. The acting in Citizen Kane is not especially memorable aside from Welles, nor is the soundtrack, but give us a break, this is 1941. Aside from that Citizen Kane features some of the most memorable scenes and subplots ever told. Three that particularly stand out are Leland's review, Kane's attempt at politics, and the attempt at turning his second wife into an opera singer. I won't spoil the story any further than this. In conclusion, Citizen Kane is a movie that no intellectual human being should go their life without seeing. It is, simply put, a masterpiece, one of only two movies at this point I would give a 10 on IMDb. But is it the best movie of all-time? My opinions have changed in this matter. I now understand why all of the critics acclaim this above all else. In my heart I would still choose The Godfather, and as you can see I am giving Coppola's masterpiece a slightly higher rating, but in my mind these are the two greatest motion pictures ever created and nothing else can approach this pair of colossal giants. Perhaps it is because the Godfather features a wider cast of subplots and characters, rather than Citizen Kane focusing on one man, but in reality it is near impossible to point out any flaws in these two pieces of perfection. This is a movie that is both technically perfect and intellectually dazzling, a film that is both superb at face value and within our mind. It is a stirring piece of cinema that is and deserves to be more revered than any of its brethren. 9.7. There is nothing more to say, but, ""I'm Charles Foster Kane! I am no politician who tries to save himself from the consequences of his own crimes!""  "
140592,tt0075148,a15haddad,united states,9,Raw emotion wins out,"Rocky is one of the most famous movies ever and spawned one of the cinema's most popular franchises. Much of it forms one of the cornerstones of film history, and it has one of the most famous scenes ever. But many people disregard it as a great movie. Even now I am utterly insulted that it is not even in IMDb's top 250. That's just an outrage. Rocky is a true classic in its field. It is also one of the most influential movies ever, perhaps not in cinematic techniques but in story techniques. Rocky is nothing else but the original underdog story. Nowadays it seems like every sports movie- no, it's really like this- employs an unthinkable underdog story. Every single one of those films takes their main focus off of Rocky. This movie never gets complicated, never enters thought, doesn't have any big plot twists or jaw-droppers, much less any philosophy or thought-provoking considerations, but it stabs at what you feel most: your heart. It is simply impossible for any good person to feel nothing in their first viewing. You root for Rocky like you have never rooted for anyone else before. That is the essence of this movie. However, Rocky does have some splendid moments of direction. The steps scene, something that has been imitated so many times, something that is just as deep into our culture as the Vader battle in Empire Strikes Back, actually has some fantastic cinematography. The best part of Avildsen and Stallone's work are the intercutting shots of Rocky training coupled with the classic Rocky theme song. I have just hit at one of the major reasons for Rocky's emotional effect: the soundtrack. Bar none, Rocky has the best and most inspirational soundtrack ever put forth into a movie. The theme song and the battle theme will flat out pump you up. It may sound silly to someone who hasn't watched Rocky, but it's the truth. The plot of Rocky is basically this: he is just another bum living in the streets of Philadelphia and the first half of the movie do a great job of creating a depressing environment and a feeling of hopelessness. He is also a boxer at clubs, very clumsy, unskilled, but with a lot of heart. Then he gets the chance of a lifetime: Apollo Creed, the world heavyweight champion, is looking for a local underdog to fight and he has chosen Rocky. From a million-to-one shot Rocky has a shot at the title. Little does he know that this is just a novelty. He trains hard with his trainer Mickey, who is one of the most lovable characters conceivable, and the movie eventually leads up to the climactic showdown with Creed. That fight pushes this movie over the top. It still stands as one of the greatest boxing scenes in the history of the cinema, maybe not as realistic or atmospheric as those found in Raging Bull but just as entertaining. And the fact that the ending isn't your typical jolly olly underdog tale. Although the most inspiring movie tale ever told this movie is not a very light one. In the end this stands as one of the greatest sports movies of all-time, in the Holy Trinity along with Raging Bull and Hoosiers. It is basically perfect in what it does and nothing more. Do not expect this movie to alter your life or your thinking, just get ready for an inspiring piece of film. 8.9. ""Did you get the license plate number? Of the truck that ran over your face.""  "
2143,tt0111161,a1tuba4u,united states,10,The best movie ever made.," If you haven't seen it yet, this picture will reaffirm hope in life, humanity and the movies.  Morgan Freeman proves himself as one of the best actors of our time.  Tim Robbins has a humble, underplayed style that fits well in the picture.  Probably one of the best scripts ever written. "
93945,tt0372784,a2600rat,united states,9,The Dark Knight returns!,"I saw the midnight showing on opening day and I was thrilled to see that Batman has returned as a menacing vigilante, not as the cartoonish parody of Batman portrayed in the last film in the old franchise. Gotham City is a dark, crime-infested hellhole, filled with feelings of hopelessness and despair, just the way I remember from the Dark Night comics. Dr. Crane's first transformation from the mousy, Milquetoast-ish psychiatrist into the delightfully sadistic Scarecrow is equally impressive. Christian Bale's performance as Batman is adequate, perhaps a little forced. I give it 9 out of 10 stars only because of the somewhat silly, cartoony plot of the villains to destroy Gotham City.  "
40708,tt0120815,A2Z,united states,10,Our young men sacrificed their lives for who?," While waiting in line to see SPR I struck up a conversation with an older gentlemen in his 70's. He had participated in D-Day. Though in the 2nd wave, he saw the results of the hell the 1st wave of men lived through. At the end of the movie I saw him seated unable to move, crying, while his wife held his shoulders. I realized I was crying too. I'll never look at another person in his 70's/80's the same way again, and for that I thank Steven Spielberg. I have read most of the previous reviews and have found a common thread: most of the negative reviews are from europeans. The same europeans our young men spilled their guts and blood to liberate. The same europeans we saved after the war with the Marshall Plan. The same europeans who now complain and criticize about the ""patriotism"" of SPR. The same ungrateful, hypocritical europeans who so easily forget that it is Americans who are buried under those countless white crosses and Star of Davids'. The amazing thing is that we are still sending young Americans overseas to save their sorry a$$e$.   "
94383,tt0372784,a34tazz,united states,9,Actually really Good!,"I reeeeeeally did't want to see this movie- I never really liked any of the other batmans... but it was so good! I saw Christian Bale in American Psycho and hated him- so I wasn't thrilled to hear he was the lead- but he was very impressive and played did a good job! Also, Katie Holmes wasn't as bad as everyone said she was- but she was not able to stand up to the greats like Michael Caine, Lliam Neison, and Morgan Freeman- nor the new actors like Christian Bale and Cillian (the doctor). All in all, the movie was very entertaining and even though it was long- about 2 1/2 hours- I never checked my watch. So, definitely go see this movie- even the ladies!  "
40864,tt0120815,a40mast,united states,7,THE definative war film to date," I dare you to find a better war film than this. It is the most historically accurate war movie there has been. The cast is top notch, with some of the biggest names taking all the parts, providing the best mix of people becoming a new family on the battle field. The plot is as real to life as any. The reactions potrayed by each actor to the near pointless mission they are sent on shows the contrast between the people sent to war, yet they all pull together and march to the beat of the drummer. To sum up, watch this film. If there was a list of film that had to be watched before you die, this would be number 1 on my list   "
7494,tt0468569,A4B4,united states,8,Good But Moderately Over-Hyped,"The Dark Knight is a good film. All-the-way-around, it keeps the audience interested and is highly entertaining, decently thought-provoking, and very impressive from a technical standpoint. The special effects are above average, although parts of it are a little below par and don't fit as seamlessly as we'd all like. The acting does not disappoint; as this film does not rely on the actors much, I have no complaints. Heath Ledger does a convincing job as the Joker, bringing new depth to the character--largely belittling the former Jack Nicholson Joker--however Heath's performance has likewise been moderately overrated. The plot is well-developed, above average for modern action flicks. In many ways I believe it surpasses Batman Begins, and because of it the series still tops the comic-book adaptations. Tonally, it is the expected sequel. It is somewhat darker, but it continues Nolan's refreshing take on the Batman series. And with this latest addition, it makes all the other Batman films even more forgettable. However, to say that The Dark Knight is the best film ever overlooks many other great films. Realistically, I would put it on the level of Jurassic Park, giving The Dark Knight a slight edge, but both deserving a spot among the top films in modern cinema. "
122985,tt0266697,A60,united states,3,Surprisingly Boring," Really, the title says it all. I was especially surprised by the poor pacing. The vast majority of the film is spent explaining backstory, but the backstory isn't that interesting. ""The Bride"", as a meta-character, is inherently empty, as is most everything else in this film. Easily half the scenes could have been cut. Even the fight sequences (which make up about 10% of the film) seemed pointless. Some people I know who really liked this movie seem to have bought into its mythology. Clearly the film has its own world, it's just not a very surprising or interesting one. There are some good jokes here and there (the line of Aviator sunglasses across the police officer's dashboard comes to mind) but a few decent gags does not a good film make. I read in an interview with Tarantino that Kill Bill Vol. 2 is going to be ""slower"" than the first installment. Slower than this? Is that even possible? Looks like ""Kill Bill"" is treading into Tarkovsky territory, except you know, without any of that Russian existentialist poetic grace.   "

His films for the most part tend to be very personal and character driven. He does character studies on his characters exploring their flaws and weakness. The Departed is one of his few films that are actually plot driven and for the most part he does a fantastic job at it. When you think of all great Scorsese films it is the character that reveals the plot. In terms of guilt and redemption all his film posses this element. Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Casino, Goodfellas all this films are character films, and we view life for the most part through the eyes of the protagonist. That besides the way that Scorsese stylize his films is more intriguing. The Departed is very entertaining and that is what film should be. This is commercial Scorsese at his best. Film was definitely geared toward the masses yet Scorsese has definitely left his usual stamp with his visuals. Film is visually stunning and that is partly due to his editor Thelma. Sound track is mediocre, I thought they used the song Gimme Shelter by the Stones too many times, where as when you think of Goodfellas and Casino, the same song was never used twice. Any way I saw it twice in the theatre and I am going to see it again.  "

Please, think about a protagonist who checks out his ""totem"" ""immediately"" after he awakes all along the movie. But at the end, he doesn't do so. At the plane, he can check it out but no.

This IMO is insulting to the people who actually fought those \nazi bastards. I think Tarantino is your average repressed sadistic white male who can't come to peace with his own intrinsic sadism and thus needs to pretend like he's actually being altruistic when portraying Jews as vicious killers who are basically behaving no better than the Nazis. The same thing he did with Django unchained only there we had black people behaving just as bad as white slavers. What pisses me of is that he won't admit it. He won't admit that he's just as evil as all the white men who committed horrible atrocities in the past and he desperately feels the need to bring Jews and blacks to that same level so that he may feel better about his own whiteness. It's OK, Quentin, just admit who you are! People will understand. We'll still watch your movies! Just spare yourself the pain man, it's OK.  "
64770,tt0910970,aabeene,united states,9,A Modern Love Story for the Stars,"While other animation studios are still digging into the same generic type of stories and characters that brought them to the dance years ago, Pixar continues to re-imagine the landscape of their craft. The best evidence for this lies in their latest offering, ""Wall-E."" In short, it's beautiful, even breathtaking in parts. In terms of animation, this is Pixar at the top of their game. When audiences aren't wooing over the latest technical achievements of the studio, they will be poignantly immersed in one of the finest love stories Disney has ever produced. Wall-E, Waste Allocation Load Lifter, Earth-Class, is designed to clean up planet Earth from the enormous amount of material waste covering land once home to life. More than just a robot, Wall-E has developed the most powerful emotion of all: love. When humans in space send another robot, Eve, to detect whether there is still life on Earth or not, Wall-E finds himself in love with a sleek white messenger sent on a mission. Many will point to the environmental messages found in ""Wall-E,"" and they are abundant. The idea that our consumerist society could get to a point where there was more human waste on our planet than actual life is daunting to say the least. There's also a warning that such a society built on this concept will become increasingly lazy and ultimately despondent to raw emotion which Wall-E craves. These themes should be commended more than anything else because Disney and Pixar actually had a will strong enough to put these ideas into perhaps their most mainstream film of the year. To label Wall-E as a part of some environmentally sound movement would be to undermine the core of the film. More than a message film or an animated one, ""Wall-E"" is a romantic comedy, plain and simple. One can go on and on about the beautiful effects and flawless character design, but when all is said and done, ""Wall-E's"" quest is to gain the love and affection of Eve; saving the world, ironically, is an objective that just kind of happens in the middle of his journey. The cinematic nods to previous works are endearing. One can clearly see the influence of ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" but even more influential works seem to be the early efforts of famous silent film comics Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. In fact, immediately after my initial ""Wall-E"" viewing, I couldn't help but think of the film as a space version of ""City Lights,"" Chaplin's greatest work, which just happened to be a silent one. The robots, the world, even the universe, tend to remain silent, but love speaks for them. In the current world of film, it's easy for a critic to declare a film an instant classic or a new masterpiece; such words easily flow out of our mouths after seeing a great work. However, it remains difficult for us to gush over a film with such affection and admiration as I have done for this one. ""Wall-E's"" not perfect, but no heart truly is. It can only do its best, and that's what this film does.  "
125463,tt0469494,aabeene,united states,10,Blood nothing short of a masterpiece,"There is a certain amount of dread surrounding the release of ""There Will Be Blood,"" Paul Thomas Anderson's adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel ""Oil!"" I anticipated disappointment in thinking Anderson's film would be yet another imitator of ""Citizen Kane."" After all, the story of Daniel Plainview plays out in the same epic fashion as that of Charles Foster Kane. Fortunately, Anderson is wise enough to understand that this is not and does not need simply to be a ""Kane"" clone. Instead, ""Blood"" is a deeply devoted and emotionally engaging telling of one man's quest to reach the top of his field. Daniel Day-Lewis gives what can only be described as the best performance of the decade thus far as Plainview. Day-Lewis's Plainview is a master of coercion and social understanding, but these traits go from strong to weak as the film progresses. Equally as interesting is Eli Sunday, brought to life by ""Little Miss Sunshine"" star Paul Dano. The brilliance of Dano's performance comes from the overzealous and almost comedic nature of Eli's ambitions for his faith and church. Eli's larger-than-life personality to the rural people of his small town puzzled Plainview, who wonders how these men and women could be so idiotic in accepting Eli's principles. In this questioning lies the essence of Day-Lewis' character, a hungry oil tycoon in the making who is as much of an enigma as the members of Eli's church. By the film's end, one could view all of Plainview's actions, which include murder, bribery and theft, as being the products not of selfishness, but, as Plainview explains, of a hatred for the simplicity of the people around him. Just as grand as Plainview's desires is the scope of the picture itself. Anderson vividly brings to life early 1900s America in a desolate, distraught matter that is not easily achieved. Robert Elswit's cinematography is breathtaking, perfectly capturing the vastness of the then-undeveloped California land with the grand scope of the open fields that hold the promise of oil. In terms of score, Johnny Greenwood's composition for the film is revolutionary. Not very often do audiences see such a dynamic flow of music combined with notes that set off a sense of urgency even in the weaker moments of ""Blood."" It should be noted that the film's less powerful segments are few and far between and are mostly produced in the first half when viewers see Plainview simply toy with his violent nature. Still, this film has such a grand ambition to it that its ultimate goal almost seems to override every other aspect of the film, except for Day-Lewis' performance. The greatest achievement of ""Blood"" is in shooting for the highest sense of dramatic purpose imaginable, and on many levels, it achieves its hopes. The end result is nothing short of an American masterpiece and a film that I feel safe in saying will only become more respected as time goes on. ""There Will Be Blood"" returns the epic film genre to its most basic, yet effective, roots and succeeds in grabbing our attention time and time again.  "

Kylo Ren failed to fill Vader's shoes as a villain I could really love (to hate). He actually comes off as annoying. A girl who JUST learned of the force can now magically use a Jedi Mind Trick AND win a light-saber duel with a ""highly trained"" user of the Dark Side? Give me a break. The visuals of this movie were stunning I must say. That is about the only positive I can truly give this film.

13010,tt0110912,Aadam Mahbubani,india,4,One of those movies you just can't hate,"Pulp Fiction is a movie that is certainly original.. there is no movie like it.. However, there does not seem to be much of a plot or a message. It is like 3 totally unrelated stories about gangsters, crime, robbery etc with a lot of language and way too much detail.. I read in another review suggesting me to watch the movie twice to really pick up the detail and understand it, but the truth is that you cannot watch a hardcore 3 hr movie without a message again! None of the stories are really ""about"" anything. They certainly are not about hit-men pontificating about burgers. Nor is the film really a satire or a farce, although it contains elements of both. At times, it feels like a tale that didn't need to be told, but for whatever reason this movie tells it and does a better job than most films of its kind, or of any other kind. But one thing in Pulp Fiction's favor is the cast.. I thought that the 2 lead actors (Jackson and Travolta) were really good.. In the end, I have failed to figure out why this movie was such a big hit, but I do not discourage you from watching it since you could have a totally different opinion about a unique movie like this.

Unlike, ordinary action flicks where the villain is just literally blown away. Arnie is really stretched to the fullest and beyond to get rid of this guy. This is what really keeps you stuck at the edge of your seat throughout the movie, and as far as I remember, there is no other movie that kept me at the edge of my seat from starting to end like this one.

I do not want to tell you much about what happens during the movie because I think it will spoil the brilliance, but I will tell you that the acting is very good, especially Madeline Stowe. Brad Pitt was also good as a maniacal scientist. Definitely one of the best Sci fi movies out there and from my side, I highly recommend, but pay close attention because this is a movie in which every single scene is connected to another. Overall, twelve monkeys is a very good movie that is something different and the director does a good job in pulling it off. It thoroughly deserves it's place on the IMDb top 250.  "

I did like the movie a lot, but for me, Heath Ledger playing the Joker is what set the movie apart from other action flicks. Christian Bale definitely plays Batman well, and the other acting in the movie was not disappointing. The special effects and intense action sequences were obviously spectacular, but I've got to say that there are other movies that have done it better. For me, the villain in the story is what makes it or breaks it, and I think Heath should definitely get at LEAST and Oscar nomination for this. I can't think of any other acting performance by a male that I've liked better this year. The Joker was extremely well played, and his grotesque appearance (no prosthetics like Jack had) only heightened the excellence of the character in this movie. He made me laugh (dark humor, mind you) and made me realize that there are truly no limits to the art of villainy. "

42245,tt0120586,Aaditya Swaroop,india,9,Edward Norton Classic,"Powerful, hard hitting, provoking, touching. AMX is truly a classic on a controversial social theme. It is one of those movies where the viewer is left stunned when the end credits start rolling and it takes a moment for him to realize that he just viewed a good work of cinema. Though many movies try, but very few leave such an impact on its audience. AMX has this quality. For me, three things stood out in this movie - Direction by Tony Kaye, dialogues (written by David McKenna) and above all, Edward Norton's portrayal of Derek Vinyard. Tony Kaye has been known to come out with work on social themes, his other known work being a documentary on abortion debate, Lake of fire (2006). Through AMX, Tony has depicted the impact of the black-white divide in a very impactful manner. His depiction of the struggle that the youth go through and the impact on their impressionable minds is spot on. But more importantly, he was able to convey the message by building up a story which conveys the impact of this racial hatred on the vineyard family - father's killing, Derek's violence, Danny's death. The sequence of events could have been done sequentially without any voice-over. But having this told by Danny's voice with flashbacks made the story more honest and real. Derek's character transformation inside prison made sense and was not random. Tony was himself the director of photography for AMX. He made sure that the shots which needed impact were done differently - slow motion, face shots. The story/screenplay is by David McKenna. Since there was no credits given separately for dialogues, am assuming David wrote the dialogues as well. Unlike other movies handling the same theme, I found the dialogues of AMX were much more though provoking & amazingly articulate. The dialogues weren't just swearing and shouting obscenities - they had meaning and made the viewer understand how clear the character's thought process was. This was amply displayed multiple times - Derek's speech to his gang before they busted the departmental store or the lunch table conversation. The same clarity wasn't showed for Danny's character and rightly so - he was simply confused whether to follow his brother's footsteps or be the good family kid. Tony's and Danny's work would have been unreal had Edward Norton not brought Derek's character to life. I would rate this as one of Edward Norton's classic (along with Fight Club). He powerfully portrayed Derek's pre-prison character as an intellectual youth misguided by neo- nazi propaganda. The extremities of his youthful obsession came out beautifully when the cops arrest Derek for the killing of two black youths, but all he does is smile. There is a look of triumph on his face, a sense of pride. Pure hatred, no regret. Overall, AMX is a thought provoking work of cinema which is well written, nicely directed and brought to life by one of the best actors of our generation, Norton. I rate this movie 8.5 out of 10.  "
63798,tt0081505,Aaditya Swaroop,india,8,One of the better horror films,"The Shining has been rated as one of the best horror flicks of its time and a Stanley Kubrick classic. It was a first of its type horror/mystery movie and brought cinematic novelty for the audience of 1980.Though I do believe its an excellent work of cinema, but I would not rate it as Mr.Kubrick's best, or comparable to classics from his stable, like ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""full metal jacket"". That does not go to say that The Shining did not have its moments of brilliance. The aspects of this movie which I appreciate are the plot (family in a haunted hotel), cinematography, background score, sound editing, direction & Jack Nicholson's maniac portrayal of the central character. Stephen king had chosen a perfect plot for his novel - isolated hotel, dark winter, no one to help, just the caretakers to deal with the supernatural and of course, with themselves. Gives me the shivers. The story and direction had a lot of grip and flow up to the point where Jack started to lose his mind (had a nightmare) - the build up was really nice. I have come to realize that the secret to a good mystery movie is if it continues to unravel bit by bit, but never giving the viewer the whole story, or the climax. As I said, the build up to the climax is critical. If it has a shocking end, all the more better. The shining had many such moments in the first half - psychic son, hotel with a murder history, a busy hotel suddenly shown as a big empty mansion, room 237 conversation between the cook and Danny, the twin girls being seen a couple of times and maybe a few more. This build-up was ably aided by haunting music & good camera-work. But somewhere the plot was lost. Some of the scenes were quite flimsy & cheesy for an audience like me - like the wave of blood coming from the lift and flowing across the lobby. Or the old lady with boils (or just bad skin) which Jack tried to kiss. Or Jack's multiple encounter with imaginary people, and maybe the real ghost of Delbert Grady. Such scenes actually led to more bitterness than pounding heartbeats. But nonetheless, Mr.Kubrick was successful in maintaining the plot based madness and continued it till the end. Maybe I wanted to get more chills. The background score, sound editing and the cinematography deserve a special mention. The background music was haunting for sure and added that extra dark-wintery feeling to the already freezing winter.The same played from the opening shot of car traveling in the mountains - beautiful scenery, haunting music. Did set the mood. The sound editing was fabulous. Its not like the clich«∏d tricks of sudden loud noises, but a potent combination of silence and background sound. The cinematography was classic horror style. Camera-work had this quality of making the viewer expect that there is something around the corner, which the camera will see at the same time as the character in the scene. It builds up the feeling of the ""unexpected""and magnifies the shock factor. Its a feeling which we all are familiar with when we close our eyes while watching a horror flick to avoid the shock. I know I did it a couple of times! The awesome co-ordination of sound editing and cinematography could be seen in a scene where the kid is riding his tri-cycle in empty corridors of the hotel - nice zippy work with just the background noise of tyres running on the wooden floor (and carpet) and camera behind the kid. Really thought the twins were just around the corner! All the above needed a central character for anchoring - Mr.Nicholson obliged. He is an artist who uses his face and various features in a brilliant manner. His expressive eyes, broad smile, ever moving eyebrows, deep crackling voice - all tools for a top class entertainer like Mr.Nicholson. He displayed cold frustration as effectively as outrageous anger. Portrayal of a frustrated madmen who slowly looses his mind was very detailed and must have resulted from a lot of homework. All in all, The shining had a lot of things which went right. For 1980, Mr.Kubrick did deliver a never-seen-before cinematic horror experience. But maybe having seen current horror flicks like ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"", I was expecting more chills. At the time of this review, IMDb rates The shining @ 8.5. I rate this as 7.5  "
65398,tt1345836,Aaditya Swaroop,india,9,The best superhero trilogy ever,"Christopher Nolan has done it again. With the same team who worked with him on the previous two parts of the Batman trilogy, he has delivered a classic finale to the one of the best superhero trilogy of our times. This film is a cinematic delight for an avid cinema admirer like me. I could not find a single low point in this movie - direction, story, screenplay, cinematography, editing, music... It takes a master like Mr.Christiopher Nolan to bring it all together. I have been witnessing a trend in superhero movies. When the superhero craze started, these movies were all about special effects based on superpowers which would WOW the audience. But as more and more of these heroes started hitting the cinemas, the audience were lusting for something new - Not just action and special effects, but maybe some more drama. Their call has been answered. Look at James Bond's latest ""Skyfall"". It was entrusted to Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to perdition) who has no history with the action genre. But he is known to add depth to his characters and overall plot. Christopher Nolan did the same to the Batman Franchise in 2005 when he convinced Warner bros to give it to an unknown director like him. This was the first time when we saw Batman as a person before the Batman we all knew. This character has emotions, he was afraid before he rose up to the challenge. Superheroes are no longer with (just) supernatural powers. They are humans like us and they feel. They can go down like any of us, but what sets them apart is their ability to rise. The Dark knight definitely rises in this epic finale! The greatest victory of TDKR is the message which Christopher Nolan has been conveying in this trilogy over and over again - the triumph of the human spirit, the win of good over evil. And this symbolism could not have been possible with superpowers or futuristic gadgets, but only when Batman breaks down and digs deeper to find his inner strength. The Batman had to rise again. Nolan broke down Batman to dust to such an extent that it made the audience actually root for him to stand up. Imagine a superhero being an underdog. Wow! Bringing out the underdog emotion in a superhero story can only be done when a lot of homework has been done on the plot and screenplay. The other cinematic aspects were upto the mark in conveying this message. David Goyer (written Blade series) assisted Nolan with story while Jonathan Nolan did so with screenplay - David has been with this trilogy since batman begins and Jonathan joined in The Dark Knight. The three of them had a fair grip on what they wanted to convey. Cinematography was done by Wally Pfister who has been with Nolan since Memento and was part of all of Nolan's projects (Inception, all 3 Batman, The Prestige, Insomnia). In TDKR, cinematography was not all about picturesque sceneries, but more about lighting and grandeur (when needed). Hans Zimmer (Music) has gained expertise in providing music for grand & action oriented cinema - Gladiator, 2 POTC, MI 2, Pearl harbour, all 3 Batman, Inception). TDKR was no different. The actors could not have better chosen. Christian Bale has been maturing like fine wine and aptly displayed Nolan's version of the Human superhero - he displayed weakness, depth of character, fear, arrogance, dug deep to find inner strength and all this, with few extra grey locks. Awesome ! Tom Hardy was a revelation in this movie and carried on the good work from his previous movies - Inception and Warrior. He was brawn, merciless and fearful. Voted in 2009 as Variety's ""10 actors to Watch"", I'll be waiting to see more of this muscular 35 year old in times to come. Anne Hathaway and Joseph Gordon-Levitt were the two other actors who justified their characters to the fullest. Joseph is just 31 and is turning out to be the next star. He has already been part of two of Nolan's movies (Inception and this one). Michael had very little screen time but had powerful screen presence. For a superhero movie, this cinema was emotionally riveting. The Avengers had 5 (or 6) superheroes but came no where close to touching the audience as the Batman Trilogy has. The best part is that this movie, like Inception, ended with possibilities - now what, did Leo (Inception) gets left behind, will Levitt be the next Batman or will Christian make a comeback with Levitt as Robin. Mr.Nolan has set the bar too high this time. Cant wait for a reboot.  "
78985,tt0066921,Aaditya Swaroop,india,9,Its funny how the colors of the real world only seem really real when u viddy them on the screen,"Stanley Kubrick was a celebrated director and screenplay writer that gave us cinematic masterpieces like 2001: A space Odyssey, the shining, full metal jacket and the list goes on. A clockwork orange is a part of this special list. Though it lost the race for the Best movie Oscar to ""The French Connection"" in 1972, I bellieve it could have gone either way - both being trendsetters & works of inspirational cinema. When I started the movie, the first shot really set my mood - The smirk on Alex's face, those eyes full of determination, hatred, scorn, revenge, unremitting, intense - just ripping through the viewer and sending a chilling message down the spine. Before Alex was imprisoned, Stanley Kubrick presented a theatrical piece of anarchy brought about in a devilish manner. Sometimes it felt like Nihilism and sometimes, just pure & unadultered paranoia. Malcom McDowell's portrayal of Alex's character must be commended - There was a sense of symphony to Alex and what he did, as if he was performing with the background music. It was like watching a concert. But the highlight of this movie was not the plot, but the theatrical extremities in which the cast portrayed their characters. This was brought together with detailed camera-work, background music, sets, artwork, make-up and symbolism. Specific sequences in the storyline helped in building up the feeling of hoodlumism and anarchy - billy & his boys raping a young girl, the garbage lying around when Alex was returning home from his evening odyssey, the vandalized art pieces, broken lift, artwork at the milkbar. Stanley Kubrick did well to create an atmosphere for Alex's delinquent behaviour. The background score added to the overall drama. Throughout the movie, most of the scenes had concert music in the background, even during acts of crime or action sequences - like when Alex and his droogs were beating Billy & his boys. When there was no music, there was silence with the dialogues echoing in the room, as if live theatre performances were getting delivered. It helped in building up the concert/theatre feeling very nicely. Stanley Kubrick did well with artwork and make-up that denoted underlying sexuality and anarchism. Detailed creativity like Alex's eyelashes and the piece of art at the murdered lady's house are classic. The poster of clockwork where Alex is peeking out with his eyelashes & smirk, still gives me a quirky feeling. Knowing that Stanley himself was an avid photographer & knew all about cinematography, it isn't a surprise that in the credits under cinematography, John Alcott's name has been mentioned only as lighting cameraman. Stanley manipulated the camera-work that suited his style & which went with the movie's flavour - the close faceshots, camera-work from unique angles to shoot the characters. All in all, a clockwork orange is a masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick, in his long list of successful pieces of work. It is worth mentioning here that clockwork is by no means an easy film to watch and/or understand, as many will be turned off by the explicit violence and rape. It'll make the viewer heavy-headed and leave the theatre in shock. But that was Mr.Kubrick's style afterall - Shock & Awe. This is a brand of cinema which'll live on for many years to come. Score - 8.5 out of 10. Definitely recommended if you have got a taste for drama.  "
79611,tt0075314,Aaditya Swaroop,india,8,A Martin Scorsese and Robert Di Nero Classic,"Before I started to watch this movie, I was awed by whatever I had heard about this classic and was also in awe of the two legends involved - Martin Scorsese and Robert Di Nero. Immediately after watching this, I was a bit disappointed. This is not to say this wasn't a good work of cinema, which it is, but guess I am a victim of ""The Over-hype"". After a few hours when I pondered upon my experience, the cinematic excellence of this classic dawned upon me. It is not as smart and hard-hitting like my other Martin Scorsese's favorites (""The Departed"", Gangs of New York), but this one grows on you. This film had it all - good starcast (its all about Robert Di Nero), good camera-work, strong script to work with, nice editing to tie-up the movie, apt music which added to the element of the movie (as intended by the director) and of course, strong direction to bring it all together. The first aspect that impressed me was the way story was portrayed by Mr.Martin Scorsese. If you actually look at it, this is just another story about a disturbed Nam marine who is back and is trying to adjust to his life post coming back from war. He is a loner, disturbed and wants to clean the streets cowboy-style. It could very-well have ended as just another action flick. But Mr.Scorsese had other plans. The movie started with the new york streets and how filthy / busy they are. At the same time, no shot was particularly stretched - it was all shot in passing, like a dream. The continuous shots of the streetlights and the traffic signals was actually very psychedelic, as if on drugs . The saxophone music, while adding a touch of classic element, was making the viewer very comfortable, as if watching in half sleep. Now I realize that it was all because this was how the protagonist was feeling - he could not sleep (insomnia). What a wonderful way to invite the viewer right in the midst of the protagonist's life ! It feels like I was made to be the cab passenger of Travis's taxi and I watched everything from the back seat. Cinematic excellence at its best ! Travis (Robert Di Nero) has been shown to be very eccentric with a quirky sense of humour, which was very rusty at times. His character (disturbed war hero) demanded such confused feelings and reactions. One of the best performances by Mr.Robert Di Nero (Raging Bull with Scorsese being another noteworthy one). ""You Looking at me?"" will always be an iconic phrase for all times to come. This review would not be complete without the mention of Bernard Herrmann's background score. The soundtrack brings out the central theme of the movie in the viewer's mind - loneliness and at times its absolutely terrifying. Deserves a special mention. In summary, this movie could have been categorized as action/crime but Mr.Scorsese made it a drama/crime movie and portrayed a strong nightmarish experience. Its a down-right riveting piece of film-making. I give it 8.5 out of 10.  "
82004,tt0338013,Aaditya Swaroop,india,9,You never know what you've got until it's gone,"Refreshingly original! Charlie Kaufman has a knack of coming up with these outright creative and never-thought-before stories. Sunshine is like an Odyssey into a lover's mind who has decided to erase the memories of his failed affair, but during this procedure, he realizes that beyond the fights, there are some memories that he actually cherishes. This could have been another run-of-the-mill love story, but Charlie combined it with this creativity and produced a bizarre piece of cinema. One thing I really love about Charlie kaufman is that he has the ability to create a different dream world through his screenplay. He did this by creating the 7 1/2 floor in ""Being John malkovich"" and he did it again by taking us inside Jim's brain where Kate's memories were being erased one-by-one - Jim's desperateness at losing Kate, shooting scenes in the light of a torch, people/things disappearing one-by-one as they are being erased - astounding, brilliant, riveting! Even the little things like Kate's ever changing hair color leave you to question why is she doing it. Eventually, you get so immersed in Charlie Kaufman's wonderland that you stop asking and just stay in his world - bewildered at what he has created ! He creates a mystique which is so unique that it borders on insanity - one mistake and the whole movie would become pshycotic ! During all this madness, somewhere you realize that this actually is a love story and all that Jim is doing is to save Kate from being erased. They have so many beautiful memories. Its amazing how Charlie Kaufman managed to sequence all the scenes together to bring out such emotions in the viewer. For me the brilliance of Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is in that one scene when the memory of meeting kate for the first time on the beach is being erased. Jim sat with Kate for 30 seconds, first talking to her as it really happened, then talking to himself as how he felt during that conversation & finally, jim and kate being sad that the memory is being erased and this being the last memory of them together. One scene, 3 emotions, all being felt by the same guy - WoW! I liked Sunshine more than Charlie's other film, ""Being John Malkovich"". Both are outright creative, but Sunshine scores on the message and the tender feeling it leaves you with. I salute you Charlie Kaufman - you really are a genius!  "
83768,tt0093058,Aaditya Swaroop,india,7,Typical Kubrick - Another side of the human behavior,"Typical Stanley Kubrick - shock & awe. Mr.Kubrick has this typical style to portray extremities of the human behavior when under pressure or showcasing the delusional side of the human mind. He did it in ""The Shining"", The clockwork orange and now again in FMJ. Many war movies have been made that take the viewer through how and why American wars were futile and without purpose. FMJ takes the same topic and shows it in typical Kubrick style - extreme side of human behavior which is sometimes delusional, background sets in line with the mood of the movie, script which shocks the viewer. FMJ does not really have a plot, but a good script. The script builds up the confusion which war has created in the minds of these so-called men. They do not know what they are fighting for - some are patriots without reason, some love guns, some are trigger happy cowboys who just want to shoot NVA (north Vietnamese army). The initial training drills on the island described the brainwash that marines are made to go through to make them brain-dead killing-on-order zombies. Even if some of them realize the futility of it all, they continue to do it so that they confirm to the larger madness. Joker had realized that but he still punished Pyle Lawrence, which eventually led Lawrence to shoot the sergeant and commit suicide. The script then shows how these ""Trained Marines"" act in the field. During the sniper scene, there was no plan which the marines were following - they were randomly moving around which got 3 of them killed, acting on pure motion, defying direct orders from platoon leader and looking for payback when the third soldier is killed. Stanley Kubrick shows brilliantly what war does to young men - it turns marines into brainless mercenaries thirsty for blood. These marines thoughtlessly sing the mickey mouse song once they have killed their targets. Camera-work was typical Stanley Kubrick style adapting as per the scene's requirements- hand-held camera when the marines are moving made the viewer feel as if he is present there and moving along with the marines, camera showing what the NVA sniper sees making the viewer skip a heartbeat and adding to the thrill factor. All in all, this is a different and typical Kubrick style of cinema. Though I still felt that maybe this was an incomplete movie, but then again, wars are pointless. This could have been dragged the same way as shown in Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"", but guess it conveyed the same point in half the time. 7.5 out of 10 for me.  "
125450,tt0469494,Aaditya Swaroop,india,8,Stunning Character-based movie !,"Based on a novel ""Oil!""∂?..A very strong & theatrical performance by Daniel. Music was loud and brought about a stillness and grandeur to the desert, oil and sweat. Daniel's swagger as a businessman (OILMAN) carried the movie till the end. Eli, the self-proclaimed priest character, was suppose to be the anti-thesis to Daniel's character, but the portrayal wasn't done as strongly as Daniel Plainview's character. Many viewers, after watching this movie, could be confused and left with bitterness. I was simply stunned. For me, the highlight of this movie was the screenplay and the depth of Plainview's character. 2 scenes bring out this aspect - one where he was drinking with his newfound brother, Henry, and claims that he does not like anyone else to succeed around him. You could feel the hatred, the jealousy and the scorn inside the man. Second, when he kills henry, buries him and sleeps on that very ground. Cold! Not a happy movie, but a good work of cinema.  "
29261,tt0099685,aadue-186-652060,united states,8,A Great Gangster Film,"The first time I saw this movie, I wasn't quite sure if I liked it or not. The more I watched it, though, the more I liked it. The violence in this film is pretty extreme, but accurate, as are the characters. This film stands out in the Gangster genre, because there isn't a ""good guy,"" and the bad guy (who is the protagonist) doesn't die. Though, a lot of them do. I think the language could have been toned down a bit. I know that's how these guys talk, but this film could have been just as good without it, and their audience would be wider. It's an important film to see, so that would be a plus. The ""Layla"" montage is one of my favorite in any movie ever, and it's the perfect blend of cinematic beauty and dark/disturbing/creepy. Overall I recommend this film, particularly if you like gangster or crime movies. It's historically accurate (pretty much), and has some memorable stuff. ""You dink I'm funny?!""  "

After it's all over, you're left with a lot more than a sigh of relief--it leaves you thinking, and you remember the characters as if you knew them. One of the top ten movies I've ever seen for its ruthless existentialism coupled with pure entertainment value. The second time I saw it it was....almost as good.  "
44733,tt0816692,AAG ---,india,10,Interstellar - A must watch for everyone,"Interstellar is a movie which makes you to think the future and ponder about the vast possibility of space travel. But more than that it makes you wonder what a genius Christopher Nolan is. I have the opportunity to watch Interstellar in IMAX and I am amazed. Forget about acting, visual effects, creativity, cinematography - the storytelling is so good that you will get immersed in the experience for the whole time the movie runs. And all the things I have told you to forget about, eventually will grab your attention after coming out of the theater. All the things fits so nicely that there is no scope for complain, no wanting more. I think this is the first movie where the actual black hole (how a star is crushed by gravity), traveling in a wormhole and idea of going beyond the horizon is depicted. Watching all these scenes will leave you awestruck, same goes for the human emotions showed in the movie. The music greatly compliments every scene. Nolan has the habit of working with the same people again and again (Michael Caine the most prominent one), and this movie is not so different. Lots of artists who appear in the previous works of Nolan have done crucial roles very efficiently. Enough said, there is no need to dig deeper about acting or anything. No words will suffice the stunning representation of the movie in the big screen. Most people compare it with Gravity, but I think Interstellar is more amazing and thought provoking. Both have great story, however Gravity has a limited scope as a movie (the brief stay in space and fighting the conditions). Interstellar makes an attempt to give us a much wider picture to ponder about. At the end its yours to decide which is the better one, but there is no doubt that Interstellar is one of the greatest movie of the year and you have to watch it, either for fun or for science.  "
122135,tt0758758,aagodhand,united states,1,Well done movie about a complete waste of life.,"WARNING: SPOILERS! Although I enjoyed some of the scenery, this movie was mostly a wast of time. It's a story of a self-important graduate from Emory University that goes on a journey of self-discovery. That would be okay, except his entire perspective on life is proved wrong at the end of the movie. He starts of by giving away all ""his"" college money, which would be impressive if it were actually his money (that he worked for) and not money his parents gave him. He then goes out West and hangs out with people and spouts off about society and how he's going to Alaska where he's going to live on his own, away from society. During this time his family is worried to death about him, and he doesn't bother to contact his sister (who he was apparently was close to), yet manages to write a letter to someone he just met after that someone goes to jail for selling pirated cable. He meets some burnout hippies and more self-important nonsense...until he gets to Alaska. MAJOR SPOILER: Once he's in Alaska the story could have been somewhat interesting except that not to long into his isolation experiment...HE DIES! Wow...I guess he really proved he doesn't need society, huh? Every point the movie tried to make, about how free he is, about how society holds people down, about how money isn't necessary, is completely contradicted by the ending. He felt the need to give away all his parents money because ""money is evil"", yet worked on a farm when he ran out of money (he had kept $500 of his parents ""evil"" money) and couldn't wait to get his paycheck. He went off to live on his own because he doesn't need ""society"" bringing him down, yet shortly after leaving society he starved to death (after eating a poisonous plant). It seems he did nothing except get himself killed. The story tries to make a thin excuse for Chris (the main character) and his behavior by showing how the parents fought all the time, but it really comes across as grasping as straws to explain narcissistic behavior. I grew up in Atlanta, my father was a professor at Emory, and I went there. I've met dozens of self-important brats over the years (and been one of them at one time), people that reject society and its ways...until they need it. Had this guy just gone backpacking in Europe like most graduates he would have eventually returned, and inevitably become the yuppie he rebelled against like most college ""hippies"" do. But because he died, somehow he's a martyr. I guess in that sense he broke the cycle, but other than that he accomplished nothing. Oh, and just to add the final blow, I have to add how ironic it is when hippies drive around the country ""to be free"", all the while burning up gas and polluting the environment more than most people will in their lifetime. Sean Penn does a great job directing, the actors are excellent, and the scenery is breathtaking. However, none of this is able to hide the fact that this is a movie about someone who wasted his life trying to prove something, and in the end proved the exact opposite. Yes, I know he was an actual person who really died, but I don't really care. I personally know lots of people who died (some of which also went to Emory) in much more tragic and meaningful ways.  "
34242,tt0317248,aagold,united states,7,Another foreign tragedy," The hype surrounding City of God has become enormous. It has obtained rave reviews here in America. Especially among the college professors and students that I frequently converse with. Unfortunately, this movie did not live up to the hopes I had for it. Having already seen ""Harder They Come"" and ""All the Forgotten Ones,"" I assumed that this film was garnering so much praise because of a message that would go above what those other films portrayed. The cover of the DVD even has a quote mentioning how this would change my life. It did not. I personally feel both of the other films just mentioned did what ""City of God"" does, and with more originality. This film takes a lot of modern movie concepts, especially those made famous by Guy Ritchie, such as interweaving plots and jumping to different points of time as the film progresses. I highly recommend seeing those other two films before this one, and it should change how impressive it really seems.   "
28224,tt0167261,aah35,bahrain,6,"Good, but not Great"," Clearly, the Lord of the Rings fanatics are taking over ImDb. They have managed to voted ""The Two Towers"" into the number 4 spot on the all-time list. Ridiculous. Certainly, ""Two Towers"" is a good movie, but it has several problems that prevent it from attaining the greatness of its predecessor, ""Fellowship of the Ring"". First, all those useless, lingering shots of Liv Tyler make me conclude that Peter Jackson, as great a job as he has done on the series, could not resist the Michael Bay-like tendency to use his film as a platform for admiring the goddess-like qualities of some members of the fairer sex. Second, the slow-motion, close-up shots of the women and children cowering in the shelter of helms' deep, anticipating a gory fate. I certainly understand their fear, but all of these sequences seem manipulative and heavy handed. Frankly, I was plenty worried about the fates of the defenders without having to be reminded (repeatedly) by Mr. Jackson that there were mothers and children present, too. Finally, in ""Fellowship"", Mr. Jackson had a little less confidence in the patience of his audience, and he was therefore much more economical in his translation of Tolkien's narrative onto the screen. In ""Two Towers"", he throws economy out the window, and the film suffers as a result. When your film exceeds three hours AND you find yourself cutting in numerous slow-motion sequences, a little self-examination is in order. I am not calling for elimination of crucial elements of Tolkien's story, but successful adaptation from page to screen requires some clever narrative devices to truncate long passages into digestible visual material. In this regard, ""Two Towers"" is far inferior to ""Fellowship"". I hope that Jackson, in ""Return of the King"", shows more self-control. Still, Mr. Jackson is on the verge of one of the most extraordinary achievements in film history. He deserves all of his success.  "
112193,tt0077416,aahale,united states,7,Why does Mike go back to Vietnam for Nick?,"#4. Why does Mike go back to Vietnam to find Nick? Be specific with this one and use examples. Mike goes back to Vietnam to find Nick so Mike can settle the pain and loss of losing one of his best friends. In the middle of the movie, Mike returns back home (from Vietnam) without Nick. Mike, however, promised Nick's wife (Linda) that he'd bring Nick home for her, and his loved ones. Due to loss of communication during the war, Mike doesn't bring Nick home like he said he was going to. Mike can hardly face doing anything in his and Nick's hometown without feeling guilty. He can't even hunt deer properly without it affecting his aim. Mike could barley bring himself to face Linda and tell her that Nick didn't come back with him. Because Mike is so distraught by this awful guilt of not bringing Nick back, he goes back to Vietnam. While he's back there, he does whatever it takes to find Nick, including handing over $1,500 to the Russian roulette men. When Mike finally gets to enter the building where Nick is, he's crowded by all the betters of Russian roulette. The next game is about to begin when Nick appears in the room wearing a red headband. He seats himself at the roulette table, as Mike takes the opposite seat. Mike got lucky, however, Nick was not.  "
44516,tt0816692,aahari5,united states,10,This is Why We Go to the Movies.,"Christopher Nolan's latest film, Interstellar, might just be his magnum opus. It stands out as one of the most visually beautiful films that I have ever seen and contains all of the intelligence, realism, and emotion of Nolan's previous films. It serves as a refreshing reminder of why we go and see films. Kip Thorne, an actual theoretical physicist, worked as a consultant on Interstellar. As a result, this is one of the most scientifically accurate films that I have yet seen. It has been proved that a wormhole in space can alter the flow of time and physics, and possibly lead into other dimensions, and the way that it is handled in the film makes it all the more believable. The wormhole depicted in the film is spherical in appearance and is large enough to allow the crew to pass through it without experiencing any physical repercussions. It should be noted that, during production, Thorne advised Nolan to avoid creating any plot elements that would deviate from the established laws of physics and that any questions the film raised should stem from science. The advice paid off, as the finished film is nothing short of brilliant. Another important aspect of the film's plot are its themes of love and hope. Cooper, played by Matthew McConaughey, is forced to leave his family behind when he is sent on the mission. His daughter Murphy is devastated and heartbroken by his departure. She is later shown as an adult, played masterfully by Jessica Chastain, working to save humanity from extinction as her father is. Cooper's ultimate goal is to make it back home to his children and while Murphy feels angry and abandoned at his absence, she eventually realizes that he isn't technically gone (the details of which I won't go into here). Perhaps the film's overall message is that love is the only force that can evolve and persevere through time and distance. Interstellar is a masterpiece that boasts an outstanding cast and a plot with fierce intelligence and emotion. Anyone who loves film needs to see it. It is unmatched in quality and is a perfect example of why we go to the movies.  "
57216,tt0078788,aahari5,united states,10,The Horror... The Horror...,"Apocalypse Now is director Francis Ford Coppola's best film, dare I say even better than The Godfather in a very close victory. The film is a harrowing and mesmerizing tale of the slow descent into madness and the effects that war can have on one's mind, and it also has the absolute best cinematography that I have ever seen. It is a film that has held its own despite a hellish production and it has become a masterpiece of its time. The production of Apocalypse Now is well known to have been a complete nightmare, with such problems that included Marlon Brando's uncooperative demeanor and weight problems, Martin Sheen's near-fatal heart attack, sets being destroyed by multiple storms, and ever increasing production costs. Production took well over a year to complete and millions of feet of film were edited down to the final product. Despite all of these setbacks, however, the end result is a wonder to behold. The story is uncompromising and harsh and we the viewers can feel Captain Willard's grip on reality slowly fade away as he carries out his journey to find Colonel Kurtz. The masterful cinematography makes the nearly-four-decade old film look and feel brand new. Coppola truly suffered for his craft, but the end result was well worth all the trouble. The film's antagonist, Colonel Walter E. Kurtz, is a very intriguing character despite his short time actually on screen. He is a highly regarded and honored military figure who has gone mad and formed his own kingdom of sorts in the jungles of Cambodia. He has become so powerful that he is even feared by the US military. When we are finally introduced to Kurtz, we learn that the horrors he witnessed and experienced during his time fighting in the war are what created his grim views on human nature and civilization. Kurtz has an almost god-like air about him. The way that he operates and commands his militia throughout the film without his physical presence gives him a mysterious yet powerful quality that make the character feel omnipresent. His back story and his influence over the lead characters even before they come to meet him creates the impression that he is somehow watching and controlling their every move and thoughts and that by the time they finally reach him, he already has some control and insight into their minds. Kurtz is one of the most interesting characters on film that I have yet seen. Overall, Apocalypse Now is truly unforgettable and is one of my favorite films. The philosophical messages of insanity and man's breaking point haunt the viewer for some time, perhaps forever. This is a film that has to be seen to be believed.  "
70855,tt0364569,aahari5,united states,10,"Even though I am worse than a beast, don't I have the right to live?","One of the many metaphorical quotes featured in Park Chan-wook's haunting masterpiece. I'm not entirely sure if it is correctly quoted word-for-word, but you get the idea. Oh Dae-Su, the protagonist, is a spiteful drunk when he is first introduced to the viewer. He is a man who is so far gone that we cannot feel any significant shred of sympathy for him. One night he is kidnapped after missing his young daughter's birthday due to his drunkenness and is confined in a shabby motel-like prison. After fifteen years he is released and is given less than a week to discover why he was imprisoned. During his, ""motel stay"" as I will call it, Dae-Su slowly re-evaluates his life. He begins keeping a journal of sorts, comprised of emotional letters to his daughter. He acknowledges his wrongdoings and becomes a wiser man, allowing us the audience to begin to empathize with him and giving meaning to aforementioned metaphor. By the time he is released, he has become a nobler and stronger man, driven intensely by revenge, and is now a character whom we can fully understand and identify. Another metaphor used in this film is, ""be it a rock or a grain of sand, in water they both sink equally"". I believe that, essentially, this means that what goes around comes around. At one point in the film, it is revealed that Dae-Su and Woo-Jin Lee, the antagonist and the culprit behind Dae-Su's imprisonment, attended the same high school as teens and that Dae-Su discovered a secret about Woo-Jin and then committed an act that left him with deep emotional scars and greatly impacted his life. During the final confrontation between Dae-Su and Woo-Jin, the latter reveals that Dae-Su's capture and release was carefully and precisely orchestrated so that an event would later occur with him in the same vein as Woo-Jin's dark secret. By doing this, Woo-Jin has gained the upper hand and has acquired an, ""eye for an eye"". Overall, I think that this is a truly excellent and memorable film. The underlying themes of redemption and karma hit hard and left a great impact on me as a cinemaphile. Be warned, although this film is not graphically violent, it is still brutal and what is implied off screen is usually quite disturbing. That being said, this film is not to be missed. This is one of my top ten favorite films of all time.  "
78008,tt0180093,aahari5,united states,10,The Downfall of Us All...,"As director Darren Aronofsky's second feature film, Requiem for a Dream is also his best. Through its graphic and hard-hitting depictions of drug abuse, the film also serves as a lesson on the American Dream and the impossibility of ever truly achieving it. The story of Requiem for a Dream revolves around four addicts living on Coney Island. The first is Sara, an elderly woman who has been selected to appear as a contestant on her favorite game show. Determined to lose her stout figure for the show, Sara becomes addicted to weight loss pills that cause her to slowly lose her grasp on reality. Her son Harry, along with his girlfriend Marion and his best friend Tyrone, is a heroin addict who becomes a dealer in order to feed his addiction and to help Marion open a fashion store. The three of them run into innumerable problems, however. Harry's arm becomes horrendously infected due to the repeated use of unclean needles. Sara looses her mind completely. Marion descends into prostitution to continue her worsening addiction and Tyrone is caught in the middle of a gang shooting which he barely escapes. By the end of the film, which I won't go into too much detail, the four have lost everything they hold dear. As I had previously stated, this film acts as a metaphor for the elusive American Dream. Sara, Harry, Tyrone, and Marion all had a dream of their own that they ultimately failed to achieve. Sara wished to be grand prize winning contestant on the game show, but her addiction became so severe that it drove her insane. Harry and Marion wanted to settle down together and open a store together, but their addictions drive them apart and they finally descend into depravity. Tyrone simply wants to make his mother proud, but his actions end up costing him his freedom. The events of this film suggest that, whether ones actions are good or bad, the American Dream is something that can never truly be achieved. Every choice that we make has a consequence. It is not only drug dependency that hinders ones success, but also issues of money, power, violence, and racial, gender, and sexual tolerance that contribute to the death of our dreams. Perhaps this is what the title of the film, Requiem for a Dream, stands for. Requiem for a Dream is an incredibly powerful, moving, and haunting film that stays with you long after the end credits have rolled. The film's performances, particularly Ellen Burstyn and Jared Leto as Sara and Harry, are all top-notch and unforgettable. Keep in mind that this film contains some very unsettling and grim situations and imagery, but those who can bear through it will love the film as I do. This is one of my top ten favorite films of all time.  "
132927,tt2024544,aahari5,united states,10,A Harrwoing Masterpiece... One of the Greatest Films Ever Made,"Director Roman Polanski once said that when making a film, ""you have to show violence the way it is. If you don't show it realistically, then that's immoral and harmful. If you don't upset people, then that's obscenity"". His quotes applies to Steve McQueen's honest and terrifying indie film in every way. This film doesn't sugar coat the brutality of slavery by using quick cuts or flashy editing, and thus we the audience are forced to see everything from whippings to lynchings and even the rape of a slave. Compared to other larger, more mainstream Hollywood films, this film does not take pride in its violence and has something that many modern films, especially if they are aimed at a larger audience, lack... humanity. The depictions of cruelty hit much harder than an average Hollywood film where the violence would normally be edited or shown off screen or even be shown in a glorifying manner, and through these images the audience is able to feel for the characters. To experience the pain and hardships that Solomon Northup endured in a dark time in American history firsthand is emotionally draining but at the same time it awakens us to the reality of an evil that still occurs today in many countries. We want him to succeed and we feel his pain. Within all of the film's depictions of intolerance and cruelty, there is also a strong message of the perseverance of the human spirit. Solomon Northup maintains his will to live despite all of the horrors that he is forced to endure and remains a strong character throughout the film. It is a relatable message, that one can survive the most grueling odds through the force of willpower, and it is one that rings true even today. Whether it be poverty, illness, bullying, or any other obstacle, one can survive and conquer the odds through their will to live and succeed. 12 Years a Slave is a harrowing, masterfully crafted film that should be viewed by everyone at least once. It is not an easy film to watch, but it is an important film because of its emotional, humane, and even educational values. I greatly admire this film because of its messages of perseverance and humanity. This is one of the greatest films of all time.  "

After Joker, you cannot better, at least you have good enough. All the other supporting cast did their job really well. Christian Bale once again showed what a fantastic actor he is. Technically the film is brilliant. The vision is really big and wide from the director and the cinematographer. They came up with some fantastic mind blowing action sequences. You don't have Batman appearance often, but when ever he enters I got goose bumps. Music is fantastic as usual and very appropriate. All the credit should go to Nolan for creating a master piece trilogy in this genre. He continues he reputation of making film with thrill and emotion.

Many times it looked like shooting has been done at home with normal camera. just could find 3-4 good scenes and nothing else. Same old boring romance, emotion which didn't add up. Acting wise i found the Tree and the animal only good. I really don't understand the high ratings of people. This is not even a time pass movie. Lots of dragging story. One scene where space carft bursts in air but people will be safe and no scratches lol, lame. Would say watch and see yourself, not a good movie.  "
44905,tt0816692,Aakash Sharma,india,9,My Opinion is on the higher dimensions !,"Interstellar is a simple story which amalgamates the tender relationship between a father and a child and the courage to do whatever it takes to keep a promise and honor that relationship. This film dares to look beyond, farther beyond what man has been able to navigate so far to preserve what's routine and rudimentary on earth. The treatment the film received made it much more than just a simple story. 'Epic' can be an apt word; sounds cheesy and overused though, but I'll go with it. Outer Space is an integral character here and not just a backdrop, and all efforts have been taken to keep this film as scientifically accurate as possible. Of course, scientists in real world have not yet actually found any black hole/wormhole and most of the science is theoretical, but they have a good reason to believe they all exist. Relativity is a deep concept which would have people scratching their heads for long. Time Dilation , the by-product of Relativity has been observed in fractional values between earth and International Space Station timings, by atomic clocks. Chris has extrapolated that exponentially so it starts to 'matter' and becomes of this magnitude. Space-time distortions, gravity being the fifth dimension, possibly even more of them, perhaps a time travel element - are what Nolan wants you to discuss about after seeing the movie and of course its all subjective and open to interpretations. There is no absolute answer. Among you and him, he has to be smarter one and you feel okay with that. No worries if you didn't get it all. No one did. McConnaughey shines through the movie. Frankly, I didn't even know him couple of movies and one television series earlier. Then I saw some of his previous movies and found he's one hell of an actor. Hathaway, Chastain, Caine have formidable roles. Can't say the same for Casey Affleck and Topher Grace. I really liked Mackenzie Foy though. The best actors don't look like they are acting at all, she is one of those kinds. Jonathan Nolan remains the unsung hero for Chris' film but he deserves special mention for doing that amount of research with Chris on the science with Kip Thorne and penning down a palatable narrative for the audience but on a tantalizing level. Hans Zimmer, hands down, brought out astoundingly different but equally great background score for the movie. Hoyte Van Hoytema from 'Her', formidably rose to the challenge of a Chris Nolan film of this Goliath scale. People at Double Negative have done their job exceptionally well. The whole cast and crew deserve applause for pulling off one of the greatest works of art. On the risk of being called pro-Nolan, this film deserves a standing (perhaps on high chair) ovation for the sheer sincerity and the scale he is known to make his movies with. He brings out the best from the actors, shoots as much of the action on film, with ridiculously huge set pieces, and doesn't leave a lot of work for the VFX guys. He has narrative style of welcoming the average moviegoer into his complex world of movies so that they don't withdraw themselves from the movie at any point even though are not 'getting' the movie completely. He's the perfect blend of old school and neo-noir filmmaking. These are qualities seldom found in a director. Arguably, Chris Nolan is considered the benchmark today in better filmmaking. This movie explores new horizons, literally and figuratively, of filmmaking so some people might have been a bit underwhelmed with film not being exactly as cohesive as some of his other films are. This film is actually two scripts merged into one, one by each of the Nolans and it felt like, when they mentioned 'Love' to be another dimension which human can't really comprehend, that the seam started to show! haha. He is not your run-of-the-mill director. You might not see it yet but maybe, before you know it, it might become a cult film and with advancements in Science in time, it might make you believe what he presented was not that wrong after all. There have been creative liberties that the makers have resorted to, but then you have gone into seeing his film to be amazed and awe- inspired, not just sit through a documentary on Physics. Nolan's decision to shoot this on film and that too lot of footage on IMAX camera, couldn't have been more apt than this movie. I sincerely hope this is not the end of movies being shot on film. Digital method has a long way to go before it can be used for IMAX, with that much bandwidth for color reproduction and immersive imagery. I hope Chris along with other major directors keep that method of shooting and getting it projected, alive. Nolan is not the first director to explore these outer space concepts in a mainstream movie. There have been attempts in the past as well, with reasonable acclaim. But not being the first to do that, of which little can be done, doesn't take away the accolades Interstellar deserves. How many of have you discussed about a movie after coming out of the theater and given it your thought and judgment? Comparison brings out the worst and one should shy away from doing that. Filmmaking is an immensely challenging ask and to have shaken you after those 2-3 hours is all that a director, as an artist, seeks as his prime reward. Whatever the critics say about this film or compare it with, Interstellar is and will remain a milestone in the history of filmmaking. P.S. - In the unlikely event of the premise of the movie taking place in real life, I sincerely hope they conserve Nolan films when they move to the other planet. haha..! No, seriously.  "
16370,tt0060196,aakostar,greece,10,An absolute must see. A movie full of Ironic twists of fate that reaches the dimensions of an ancient drama,"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a movie par excellence. Not only does Sergio Leone in close cooperation with Ennio Morricone and his groundbreaking score manage to create a masterpiece of modern movie history. He also revolutionizes the Western by shifting the clean and glorified image of the west that existed so far and changing it into a dirty, often ugly and very brutal face. Furthermore he underlines some of the motives that kept this era going as they do today. Greed, violence and the absolute fight for survival and sometimes the strongest one revenge (which is a dominant factor in his movie Once Upon a Time in the West). However his characters which carry this movie all along give it a much more human and realistic feel. Lee van Clef, Clint Eastwood and above all Eli Walach make their characters become very vivid and the viewers sometimes catch themselves identify with them although they probably would not have expected it earlier. The twists and turns that bring the characters into situations that no one would have expected moments earlier are truly what life is all about; you never know what will happen the next moment. With a little twist of fate (and it twists a lot in this movie) the character that is on top on the one moment is the one who looks into a barrel of a gun the very next moment. The allegories that Leone uses in his move seem almost endless. Let's mention just two examples. The truly inspired and masterful invention of the amphitheatric setting of the cemetery which has a center stage that is surrounded by crosses and almost looks lice an ancient theater. It is there where Tuco, the Ugly (who is notably the most ""human"" character in this movie) runs full of anticipation like a little child trying to find a familiar face. However he just searches for the grave that contains what everybody is hunting after in this movie, the treasure. It almost seems like the dead are watching these three characters as they aspire to become rich or ... just become another cross in this cemetery. Inside this ""arena"" the final shootout takes place with Leone producing an editing with his ultra close ups that are breathtaking. In this theatrical surrounding the high point of the story (that has elements of an ancient drama) is reached. Another really astonishing moment is the final scene with Tuco, his neck in a rope, balancing on a cross with 100.000 $ in gold dollars lying before him but he is not able to do anything with that money since he is on the verge between life and death and all the money on earth not being able to help him. A truly ironic picture and Leone manages to produce a lot of such irony in his movie. Before the liberating shoot from the Good (played by Clint Eastwood who almost acts as a character who is responsible for divine justice) that cuts the rope, the viewer is for a moment exposed to the paradox of life and death. This movie is an absolute must see! Although some might think it is just a spaghetti western its influence remains unparalleled even today!  "
111677,tt0046438,aakostar,greece,8,Very interesting movie however it needs some patience from the moviegoer,Tokyo monogatari (or Tokyo Story) is a very human story. It contains a lot of everyday life which at times can make it difficult to follow since it may feel a little bit slow. However who is patient gets rewarded. And Ozus way of telling this story is very quiet but effective. The images he produces and the very minimalist camera work creates a rhythm that sucks the viewer in and slowly opens him/her up for the sad but essential ending of this movie. Ozu never tries to impose his story to the viewer. It looks like he follows his actors very disciplined and calm. This very structured and clear camera-work will alienate many modern moviegoers who are used to much more dynamic images. However lovers of purist cinema and fans of Aki Kaurismaki will probably love it. Impressing also to see how close the everyday life of Japan in the mid 50s is to the western way of life.  
39519,tt0245429,aakuntz,united states,10,A classic children's film,"Like many of Hayao Miyazaki's films, Spirited Away is a fun movie that at the same time provides thoughtful themes and stunning visuals. The main character, Chihiro, is both easy to relate to as well as inspiring, and like many other characters in the movie, she is very distinct and memorable. The movie is extremely well paced, with both slow, thoughtful segments as well as quick action-packed sequences. Though it does not hurt to be familiar with Japanese culture and mythology (as it certainly adds a lot to the movie), it is not necessary to enjoy the film. As both a fun film for adults or a movie for children to enjoy, Spirited Away is highly recommended.  "
144237,tt0088247,aalataur,finland,10,"Great, simply great","Well, what can I say. Simply the greatest action movie ever, and I've seen a LOT of them. I prefer it to T2, and any other Cameron film to that matter. It has more solid ""mood"" to it than T2, less commercial ""Terminator Action Figure"" -like. Harder, colder, bleak, dark and still full of emotion. I like the blue greenish color palette. I love the intensity and cohesiveness of the visuals. There's nothing to add, every frame counts. A brilliant plot, I like how the story unfolds during chase scenes. The story moves like a freight train. No scene could have been left out. Every shot and every line is perfect. Michael Biehn is great as a passionate soldier, who has seen no peace. He is always good as a soldier. I like so many things about it better than T2, which is also great sci-fi / action movie. Music is great, especially in the scene where Sarah and Reese escape from the police station. Gives me the chills every time. Also love the two 80's songs playing in the Tech Noir -club. Yeah, it's 80's movie and hair styles would make you laugh in any other movie. But in this one, they don't bother me. They are the only thing goofy about the film. Even Arnie fits the role. Terminator scanning environment while driving the police car, with burned eyebrows - great scene. Looks really machine -like. People always whine about the terminator FX in the final scenes. Why? They look great. Especially the closeup shots, scary stuff. The music is also awesome in this part, when Terminator lifts the door off for example... I love it, music goes hand in hand with every frame. Few sci-fi monsters look scary, but T-800 looks scary, the bleak stare and forever grinning teeth. Also, the movie is clever. It has something to say. About nukes and technology spreading everywhere. The time travel element in a plot always causes plot holes, 'cos time traveling is a paradox. In every time traveling movie there's plot holes, Terminator hides them well enough for a action flick.  "
6076,tt0468569,aalataur-2,finland,7,"Overrated, way overrated","The IMDb rating 8.8 is purely ridiculous. If Heath Ledger would be still alive, it would be at least one star lower. I didn't find this movie to be a high quality film like say, The Godfather or The Shawshank Redemption. The first scene at the bank was nice, but then it sort of went downhill from there. The plot is quite hard to follow, not because it is a very intelligent plot like say, in L.A. Confidential, but because some crucial events are not shown to the viewer. Also I found the voice that Batman speaks with very campy, corny and ridiculously macho. The type of voice used in Braun commercials, times five. Does the Batman suit have some kind of microphone system which makes your voice ridiculously low? Or did Bruce Wayne alter his voice himself?.. gosh, would be kind of tiresome to do that all the time. And about Ledger's Joker, it's nothing that extraordinary. I think Jack Nicholson did equally well with his version. It's just a well acted, basic psychopathic character, but nothing groundbreaking like Norman Bates in Psycho or John Doe in Se7en. It's not a bad movie, it's just not worth all the hype. Ledger's death made this movie a super success, not the movie itself. "

I have all Indys on DVD, and the first one is very good, second a bit too dark (plus I hate the nagging bimbo that tags along for the whole time). Fourth one was blasphemy. I don't even have it in my collections, it's hidden in a drawer (a lot like what happened with Alien 4). Last Crusade is the best of the quartet, in my opinion. It has a lot of humorous scenes, especially all of those including Sean Connery and Harrison Ford in the Nazi territory. Their cooperation is phenomenal, it has same kind of kinetic humor as some great Chaplin movie. The film is full of well made action, and not to forget witty details and dialog. The quest itself and end scene are the most epic ones in the series. ""He chose... poorly."" I simply love this one. People usually say that the first movie in the series is the best one, while it's obviously the most original one, it's not necessarily the best. Indy 3 took the great idea and took it to the next level. Talking about the fourth one, I wish Lucas would still have the magic. He seems to have lost it, later additions do Star Wars story didn't impress me either. I guess on one can be on the top forever, shame...  "

You can't say it's bad or everyone at the party will think you're dumb redneck? I say if you feel that way at a party, say it anyway. And have pride in doing so. It's a Scorsese movie. So the critics are on their toes. Just like a new Metallica album. They made so many good ones, right? So it's gotta be good, right? No one dares to say that those guys should quit. Major critics like Roger Elbert set the overall opinion, minor critics from small town magazines follow, because they don't dare to disagree. Well, someone might dare to disagree, but no one gives a ****. The movie has no rational plot. Events are dreamlike, it starts as any other movie, but when the events go on, it gets more and more irrational and you can't really tell which parts are of DiCaprio's characters dreams, and which are the reality. It gets even more complicated towards the end, viewer trying desperately to understand what's going on, waiting for that final scene which explains everything (or at least something), the scene after which things make sense. Like in Fight Club, or Sixth Sense, or Shawshank Redemtion. But no. No such a scene. No explanation. No sense. End credits roll in, with all the questions left unanswered. All you get is the feeling of been raped in the *** once again with artsy wannabe-intellectual crap with no plot whatsoever, and your wannabe-intellectual Bj«Ùrk listening idiot friends talking about it for months. Sure it has good visuals, but the script is very bad. Also the music is too underlining, you can't make a normal looking country scenery look ""evil"", just by playing Imperial March from Star Wars over it. SPOILER: And yeah, I understood how the events are happening in his head. He could have been an inmate from the start, or he could have been the victim of foul play. It's for the viewer to decide and blah blah.. It's so easy to let the viewer to decide, that way you don't have to have a clever script. It's funny how plot holes suddenly become ""masterful details"" and and ""intriguing play between illusion and reality"", when it's a Scorsese movie. I hate this type of movies, I want a movie to challenge me intellectually, and give me a reward. This movie, no reward. At first you think you were challenged, then you realize that it was all a dream and wake up to being ***raped.  "

7359,tt0468569,a-aljaf,united kingdom,8,"Excellent film, not so excellent sequel.","Firstly, let me stress that this is a great movie, enjoyable, exciting, interesting; great acting and story. But that is comparing it to general movie standards, I didn't expect a great movie, I expected a sequel to Batman Begins. This review is based on the quality of Batman Begins. The film lacked in many areas, I felt like they replaced all the bad things from Batman Begins, but also the good things! Firstly, one of the best things about Batman Begins was the stress on batman as a symbol feared, using the darkness and shadows to his advantage, in this one he just turns up, one second he's on the ground, camera changes and bang he's knocking someone down... riiight... Secondly, the focus should have been on Batman like the first one (in my opinion), taken from his point of view, however most the film we were following Harvey Dent or the Joker (who was played excellently as many have said, makes it sad we won't see another Ledger performance :(), this made the film seem a lot less like a Batman film, more like a film about something else he just shows up now and then. I think TwoFace's transition to evil was really unbelievable, I think they should have saved him for the next film, showing him in the last shot before the credits role in. However his character was killed just as fast as it was introduced. Joker was more then enough bad guy for the film, he was unnecessary. His end caused a huge anti climax. Lastly, I think a lot of the film felt like it was patched together... For example how Two-Face kidnapped Harvey Dent and Rachel was pretty ridiculous, so the cops figure ""oh we caught Joker, one cop escort should be enough... even though we have mentioned repeatedly many different criminals, politicians etc will be after Harvey Dent"". Just seemed very unbelievable and generally not thought through. How the Joker escaped, so whose idea was it to leave just 1 policeman in the room with him whilst he's untied, with no additional police watching. Wouldn't the ""bomb"" on the ""fat guy"" be noticed when they were searched, etc etc. To much was just not thought through (or at least it felt that way). All in all, as a film it was really great, and I did enjoy it thoroughly, I wish it had been 10 hours long! But as a sequel to Batman Begins I was really disappointed. "

Each one of the characters is fit perfectly for their roles and there isn't a dialog in the movie which is wasted. This is probably the best Tarantino film and is quite better then Pulp Fiction (Which kind of annoyed me) because it has a solid plot, great acting and simply an amazing end.

The camera work in this movie is excellent but the true winning part of the movie comes at the end. The end scene is one of the most suspenseful scenes I have ever seen in my life. That one scene turns around a primarily sad and dirty movie and makes this movie worth the wait. My advice would be not to give up on this movie halfway or a quarter through. Watch the whole thing! As mentioned before the camera work is excellent and the acting is out of this world. The way that heroin addicts are portrayed in acting is nothing short of extraordinary! Ewan McGregor shows us with his body how his character is struggling with his addiction Overall this movie is a must watch for anybody who can take a dirty and gloomy movie and is ready to wait for the brilliant end!

There isn't a moment of boredom, indeed most of the interrogation in the police station only serves to suck you in deep into the fiendishly clever plot. Story within a story! In this action-packed drama directed by Bryan Singer, a mythical hit-man hoodwinks the cops into playing into his paralytic hands, while coolly extricating himself from their clutches. Was there a real Keyser Soze?? Or was he a mere figment of the imagination? Probably both? Kevin Spacey steals the thunder in a highly composed, eccentric and yet definitively mesmerizing performance. Starting from the opening lineup right up to walking out of the station, loosening the limp, and speeding away with his associate, his sombre demeanor captures the very mystery and essence of Soze's character, as also his comrades in crime. With an equally fine supporting cast comprising of Kevin Pollack, Chazz Palmintieri, Benicio del Toro, Steven Baldwin and Gabriel Byrne, there is very little that can go wrong. Even after 10 years, the suspense and the minute attention to detail, keep you riveted as you watch the film for the 5th, 6th, 10th or umpteenth time.

79992,tt0075314,Aam Aadmi,united states,8,"Emptiness and loneliness in a crowded, urban jungle","This 1970s classic starring Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, a New York city cabbie, cuts a small snippet of his daily life and takes viewers on a bumpy ride along the back streets and dark alleys of the human mind. Returning home from Vietnam, a young Bickle confronts the prospects of finding a civilian job, settling down in an unsettling and crime-ridden city, the longing to meet someone special, and a deep-seated desire to put the violence behind him and get on with a 'regular life'. It builds the tension like a coiled spring until final climax. De Niro delivers a brilliant performance, along with credible roles by Cybill Shepherd as the love interest, and Jodie Foster as a young hooker. Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver deals with a whole plethora of issues of great significance in a post-industrial world. The broken relationships of many millions, lost connections between friends and lovers, identity and self-expression, kinship and brotherhood -- all the fine sub-texts from just under the surface are brought to the fore-front, for everyone to take a look at, and perhaps examine. This movie along with Mean Streets and Raging Bull marks the character arc of Scorsese as a director. Using a common template to paint in bold fresh strokes, Scorsese at once informs and imbibes the experiences of growing up in Little Italy, of family and relationships, of loving, and leaving and what it once meant to be 'just a kid'. Thirty years later, it remains a 'must-see' for fans of good cinema and good performance both.  "

This is perhaps his simplest and most stirring movie. A simple setting, a very straightforward story line and very real characters. There was nothing extraordinary about this movie, except the journey that it will take you on. For a little over two hours, you become a bureaucrat in the pre- reformation Japanese society. You start off as a corrupt officer of the government and you then go on to experience apathy, sorrow, grief, revival, struggle, disappointment and then finally inner peace. The movie is not just about Japanese society. It is not a commentary on the state of affairs at that time. It is a brilliant take on the human condition itself. A telling tale of transformation, by whatever means, of a human being into a humane being. Yet, it is bitter-sweet in the sense that even such a metamorphosis doesn't really change things too much. People see the man and his transformation, they hear his story. Some of them even weep for him and grieve, but in the end, they all move on. C'est la vie! A must watch for all movie aficionados and a movie worthy of being cherished. A classic and a masterful work of art.

35059,tt0114369,Aamir Malik,pakistan,9,An Epic on Crime & Detection,"Se7ven is a classical movie on crime and detection. The film moves around two detectives; one seasoned and one novice. They are on a mutual assignment to investigate and arrest a heinous serial killer involved in torturing and murdering people. The story is excellently written by Andrew Kevin Walker; depicts great home work on plot, might involve review after review by him before finalization, in depth psyche of all characters and order of happening of events in an ascending order of gravity. The psyche of the killer was greatly conceived. There are a number of films on torturing and serial killing but it was a unique idea that what paradoxical impact one can perceive from great writings of Dante! It's a genuine thinking of writer and super cinematography by the director. Acting of Morgan Freeman is splendid. He has the god given talent of absorbing into characters created for him. His dressing however resembles to ""Columbo"" somehow. Brad Pitt was great except in last scene when he was double minded; his hesitance was understandable but acing was not that great as it was in whole film. Viewers' interest, suspense and mystery of the film lasts until the last scene as nobody was suspecting what actually happened; again full marks to writer and director. This movie is up to the level of Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock and we have David Fincher; an Alfred Hitchcock in pipeline. This is the movie of the Director David Fincher. He is the captain of the ship and knows how to set sail, where to speed up, where to show emotions..... all is excellent. The choices of sets and locations are great.

Best part is Heath Ledger playing the Joker. It has some of the most quotable lines. It's part of one of the best trilogies. It has everything perfect from direction to acting.

It was first released in North America on March 31, 1999, and in Australia on April 8, 1999, and is the first installment in the Matrix series of films, comic books, video games, and animation. Neo is trained as a member of the rebellion. A socket in Neo's skull, formerly used by the machines to connect him to the Matrix, allows knowledge to be uploaded directly into his mind. In this way, he is able to quickly learn numerous martial arts styles, and impresses the crew with his speed when sparring in the rebels' virtual reality ""construct"" environment. Further training introduces Neo to the key dangers in the Matrix itself. He learns that fatal injuries suffered within the simulation will also kill one's physical body in the real world. He is warned that the Agents he previously met are powerful sentient computer programs with the ability to possess the virtual body of anyone still directly connected to the Matrix, whose purpose is to seek out and eliminate any threats to the simulation. Morpheus is confident that once Neo fully understands his own abilities as ""the One"", the Agents will be no match for him.  "

The judge asked the 12 jurors to conversate on various aspects and evidences of the case and finally put their decision before the court that whether the boy is guilty or not. Unrevealing the details of case I want to write that this is, of course, one of the best movies that I ever saw. This movie confluences the intellect of the script writer with impeccable direction and formidable acting performances. The way the case was resolved, dealing with disclosed facts and the analyzation of the witnesses' testimonies in pragmatic way is extremely tremendous, and thus, making it one of the best in the history of Hollywood. This is recommended to all. If you are expecting something EXQUISITE, FORMIDABLE, SOPHISTICATED, IMPECCABLE, ASTOUNDING and FASCINATING, then this is a MUST WATCH MOVIE. I'LL RATE IT 9/10. "

The movie takes a turn at the last hour, that makes one feel the greatness of Oscar Schindler and the exquisiteness of the movie that words of appreciation comes out of his mouth automatically. Regarding the performance I would like to comment that everything from acting to cinematography, from story to direction etc. is fabulous and appreciable.

I will regret not saying that this movie is the BEST movie that I ever watched in my life. I watched this movie without German being translated into English, but still that movie fascinated me so much that I rated this movie 10/10, which I usually do not do. I can say that it is a big mistake not to watch this movie. Anybody who understands what a movie is and can feel what a movie can be like will find that this is the Best movie ever. The acting in this movie is impeccable, the direction is exceptionally outstanding, the presentation of movie is magnificent, and Script so exquisite that it makes you lost inside the movie and make you feel respect and admiration for the movie makers and also the performers. There are many scenes in the movie that alone deserve Oscars, but unfortunately, this movie received only 3 Oscars, it is a pity that people were not able to understand the movie, as I cannot imagine something better than this. The scene in which a hungry man eats the food from the road, and the woman beating him is worth 10 Oscars. The squabbling between the brothers, the slapping of Wladislaw's father by the German soldiers, Snatching the newspaper from his sister Halina, Cruelities of the Germans on the Jews and throwing the man out of the window, making people run and shooting them, killing of the young child stealing food from the forbidden area, Wladislaw's struggle for his survival and being caught by a German officer, Killing of old laborers, Stuffing of people inside the train and removing them, Wladislaw's supporting the young Jews and polish by hiding armors in the food and then throwing them off the wall, drinking of contaminated water in the destroyed hospital, eating rotten potato etc. are some of the scenes of the movie that, HONESTLY, WILL MAKE YOU EMOTIONAL AND SO MUCH IMPRESSED THAT YOU ARE LEFT SPEECHLESS, HOW TO PRAISE THE MOVIE, THIS IS THE MOST OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OF Hollywood, IN MY VIEW THIS MOVIE DESERVES 100,000 Oscars.

Intelligent film making at its very best with great story telling, atmospheric photography and music perfectly capturing the immediate post war chaos of a shattered city with masterly direction from Carol Reed to top off Graham Greene's screenplay. All the performances are excellent, but my particular favourite is Trevor Howard as the world weary Major Calloway who steals the film even from Orson Welles. Joseph Cotten is underrated and does a tremendous job as the central glue to the plot, which is not an easy part to play. Ignore the Philistines who demand everything goes at 100mph.

It's relentless in its quest to explain why and how a man of Bruce Wayne's wealth and public persona would dress up like a bat and battle crime. This is the core of the movie, and it treats this with confidence and conviction. When a movie believes this much in the story it's telling, it's much easier for the audiences to believe in it as well. This is a big cinematic experience, and it shouldn't be missed. One of the year's best films, and quite possibly the best comic book-hero-movie of all time. If you have seen this movie once, then it gets even better by the second time you see it.

Robert DeNiro, as always, is fantastic, but James Woods plays an amazing role that has gained my certain respect. I wished Joe Pesci would have been worked into a bigger role because he is outstanding and hilarious in mob movies, but his minimal screen time and rather insignificant character role can be explained. He would doubtfully fit as any of the main 4, and beyond that are only a couple other key characters and he wouldn't work as any.

Finally, due to the draw of his attraction to his teenage daughter's friend, Lester Burnham (Spacey's character) flips out and has a mid-life crisis to end all mid-life crises. Chaos ensues. I couldn't comment about this movie without also mentioning Annette Bening's performance. It's hard to fake a nervous breakdown, and I can't imagine being in a room with her for some of these scenes.

More importantly, despite some of the plot's predicatibility, the overall pace of the movie is well-maintained throughout the movie.

The American dubbing team, whoever they are did an excellent job picking voices, they got top notch actors to do the job right (unlike most animes today).

The action sequences are well choreographed and are actually fresh and new for once instead of bullet-time or just guns in general. Compared to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, this is right up there in my opinion. I respect everyone's opinions except for those that come from crass critics; they have probably been nose-deep in trash for so long that they forgot what a good movie is like. This movie is not going to make you scratch your head; its just great fun with humor if you can stomach spewing blood and the occasional decapitation. I recommend:.:Cowboy Bebop:.if you can watch anime, this is very close to the style and characters of Kill Bill. This isn't Dragon Ball Z or Pokemon anime though; if you watch the first 5 episodes of Cowboy Bebop, you'll swear Kill Bill is a prelude to Cowboy Bebop.

69746,tt0119698,Aaron (zephaniah@hotmail.com),United States,10,a triumph and a joy," This movie is a triumph for animation, and for moviegoers who want that something that is missing from the Disney features we are all familiar with. Hayao Miyazaki has created a wonderful world of full and fleshed out real human characters in a world changing from one of magic and wonder to the more mundane. I've never felt so much emotion and wonder in an animated picture since watching a little-known animated flick called ""Warriors of the Wind"" (1984), which I'm now convinced must've been made by Hayao as well. Besides the obvious quality voice-talents of Billy Crudup as Prince Ashitaka, and other notables such as Gillian Anderson and Billy Bob Thornton who also do surprisinly good voice overs for main characters, the story itself was in no way swallowed up by the star-power in this film. As a matter of fact, I was pleased that there were no opening credits... the movie just started right up and put me in it..and left me spellbound for the full 2+ hours. The movie is not about commercial ""wows""; it's a a heartfelt story about the magic of the world fading in the face of humanity as they strive top quickly to ""grow up"". Of particular interest to me is the soundtrack; the music is absolutely wonderful and was responsible for instilling in me the sense of adventure and wonder that pervades this movie, as well as conveying the breadth of emotion this movie contains. While this movie can be enjoyed on a certain level by children, it's plot and theme are very much in the pervue of adults as all the characters basically are at least human in their nature... just trying to hold on to the kind of world they want. Don't wait another second viewing this... it's a keeper.   "
114480,tt0266543,Aaron (zephaniah@hotmail.com),united states,10,The best Pixar film yet!," Yes, it was THAT good! First off, the animation was superb. We are talking total immersion in this oceanic adventure. No pun intended. Okay, it was. But still.... The amount of detail to each individual fish, shark, whale, seagull, anemone and turtle is astounding. If not for the human-like facial expressions/exaggeration and characteristics you would almost think you were watching a National Geographic special. Only better! And the water! Of course you have to make it believable that you are watching a movie about being underwater...and they sell it. Very realistic and imaginative depiction of ocean life down to how the sunlight streams through the water. Okay, the eye-candy out of the way (wow, animation never looked so good!) the voice-acting is fantastic! Albert Brooks as Marlin (Nemo's Dad), Ellen DeGeneres stealing the show as Dory (she was extremely funny), and of course other big names like Geoffrey Rush, and Willem Dafoe and even Eric Bana of soon-to-be HULK fame lent their voice talents to this grand story. If you don't know the story by now, it's basically this: Nemo is a clown-fish that accidentally ends up being taken from his home. Marlin, his over-protective father sets off to search for him in the big blue, and along the way picks up help from very interesting characters along the way, not the least of which is Dory. During the first 15 minutes of the film you are introduced of course to the characters and then a tragedy occurs leading us to the events of having to find Nemo. Even though this film like all Disney fare, is intended for kids enjoyment, it has some grown-up themes and plenty of things for adults to enjoy. Pixar has demonstrated their ability to make a film on kids and adults level alike with their other efforts. I was surprised but how successful and seamless a story this was, considering that it was director Andrew Stanton's first time at the helm of a Pixar studio's film... but he has carried the tradition of perfection with flying colors. Most movies, animated and non-animated alike, usually never get it so right. The music is a superb mixture of orchestral music and appropriate tropical instrumental music to set the mood and tone of the story and it's various moments. Instead of Pixar favorite Randy Newman doing the score for yet another Pixar flick, the reins were handed to Thomas Newman, who is none other than Randy's cousin as well as the son of Alfred Newman, who is famous in his own right for his film scores before his death in 1970 resulting from emphysema. His (Alfred) most recognized work, and perhaps most insignificant, is the theme you hear during the FOX 20th Century studio trailers before one of their movies. At any rate, Thomas Newman has composed a fantastic score that sets the mood wonderfully, and yet never really stands out above the events of the movie. And why should it? The rendered animation is a sight to behold and carries the story well enough on it's own along with the stellar voice cast. I give this movie 10 stars!   "
145335,tt1392214,Aaron Anaya,united states,7,A Law & Order Plot With Interesting Ideas,"I really wanted to love this movie. I was a huge fan of the director's previous film Incendies, but this one is just a B grade thriller that is elevated by masterful cinematography, excellent direction, and some truly great acting by the entire cast. This movies is filled with interesting ideas that have to brushed aside in service of a plot which would not be out of place in your average Law & Order episode. The film has a strange religious subtext that is both underdeveloped and overwrought. I could see half of the plot twists coming and in the third act the film basically became a Law & Order episode with an overly simple resolution and ""ambiguous"" ending. The real problem here is the script. It does have some interesting ideas like the quirks of Hugh Jackman and Jake Gyllenhaal's characters, but these and others have almost no development beyond the one or two scenes that feature them. If the director had been allowed to rewrite the script the film would have been a lot better and likely have the same impact as the director's previous film. That being said the film is still a well-acted, well- filmed, and intermittently well-written thriller that is extremely emotionally effective and occasionally disturbing.  "

It works as a great holiday movie too, a unique mark of the first two Die Hard movies something i felt went well with the other action movies from the 80's Lethal Weapon, you get a holiday vibe from the first few minutes of every movie, a perfect movie to start a cold December morning. An other great aspect of this movie is how the atmosphere truly dates the movie, transporting you from your comfortable 21st century living room to a 1988 Los Angeles.  "
27187,tt0167261,Aaron Bilawchuk,canada,9,Why the changes?," The Star Wars Universe is almost dead to me. George Lucas has destroyed that world beyond repair now. Prequels and 'Special Editions' have ruined what was once pure and good. What hope is there now? What do we have to fill the void? Like a light in the darkness came Peter Jackson's inspiring and ambitious attempt to take the greatest piece of historical fiction of all time, and turn it into a trilogy of movies. Fellowship of the Ring has escalated to one of my favourite movies of all time in the span of a year. As Two Towers approached, many wondered if it was just a fluke, if Jackson had used up all his fairy dust on the first one. Then the movie came, and all fears subsided. Mostly. I do love these movies, and Fellowship and Two Towers are both outstanding films. What really got me, though, was that there were some glaring deviances from the books in the second movie. In Fellowship, any changes that took place, or new scenes, could be explained as if they had happened during the course of their journey but hadn't been written in the books. In Two Towers, they made huge detours and character changes. There were several differences that, for some reason, really bothered me. Luckily these aren't the majority. Without spoiling the movie for anyone, I'll just touch on the changes that bothered me most. What happened to Faramir? Why had his personality and 'quality' changed so much from the books? The changes made in the films put the ring in IMPOSSIBLE peril, from which the hobbits should not have escaped. Maybe it makes for a more exciting sequence, but it doesn't make sense based on previously established facts about the enemy or the ring. Other things that bothered me: Wouldn't Merry or Pippin have referred to Gandalf by name before he 'remembers' it later? If there are 2000 Rohirrim, why do you only see about 50 when the party first encounters them? What did Treebeard THINK Sauruman was burning over there in Isengard? I won't mention anything else at risk of giving away too much. The rest of the film more than makes up for these differences. The excellent battle at Helms Deep, the Golden Hall at Edoras, Wormtongue, and the Dead Marshes are all elements that show why this movie belongs next to its excellent predecessor.

It was the top 100 movies of all time, and I made it my personal goal over my lifetime to watch every movie on that list. Every now and again I watch one of the movies on the list, and check it off my yellowed piece of newsprint. I got to see quite a number of those movies, and the list was beginning to fill with red checkmarks. But there was one odd point. I had never seen movie number 1. The top rated movie of all time by the AFI. I had never seen Citizen Kane. Now I finally have a red checkmark next to number one. What's my take? It's an enjoyable movie, well done and well presented. As a movie by today's standards, it's simply a good film. The best movie of all time? Not even close. Revolutionary, influential, and important - yes. The aura that surrounds this movie, the scandal and the social commentary give this film its credibility. The style of the filmmaking is ahead of its time, and its presentation influenced countless productions after it. Even though I had never seen the movie, I knew what 'Rosebud' was by the time I was seven years old. It's not the story that puts this movie in the number one spot; it's the aura and influence that surround this movie. And I have to give credit where credit is due - Citizen Kane may not be the best film ever, but so far I believe it may be the most important.   "
16405,tt0060196,Aaron Bradley,united states,10,Just... So... GREAT," This movie is so great that I can hardly find the words to describe it. It's really that good. It's definitely long, but I found myself not caring, wanting more when it was over. The dusty feel it gives is not only seen in the locations, but also in the type of film used itself. All the characters are dead on, but Eli Wallach (The Ugly) is especially believable as the rough outlaw who's malicious and terrible one minute, but as soon as he needs something from blondie, acts like his best friend. The scene with his brother at the church also shows he's more than a two dimensional character. I've made it a goal of mine to see every movie on the imdb's top 250 list (I'm halfway done) and I can honestly say that so far this is one of the best. While not my favorite movie (Nothing beats Trainspotting), it belongs in the top ten as it is an absorbing and well done piece of work. P.S. What an amazing soundtrack!  "
21106,tt0120737,Aaron Bradley (scissors1),united states,8,No. 1 it is not," For more than a year I've used the IMDB's top 250 movies of all time list as my 'canon' for great movies. And 95% of the time I agree fully with it and the ratings people collectively give the films on it. But this movie fits in that 5% that I just can't agree with. Don't get me wrong, I saw this movie the first day it came out, and was very enthusiastic to see it. My friends I saw it with had read all the books, but I had not. By this time it was #53 on the IMDB just from it's non-American release. And after seeing it I truly thought it was a great epic adventure. I thought ""This is an instant classic. Sort of a second Star Wars trilogy (I don't count episode 1)."" BUUUUUUUUUUT..... When I checked it's rating today, I was, well, just disappointed. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT DESERVE THE #1 SPOT ON THE IMDB LIST. It is a great movie, and never before had I enjoyed a whole 3 hour film like this, but their are a lot more films that are JUST SO MUCH BETTER! Schindler's List! Memento! The Usual Suspects! American Beauty! Pulp Fiction! American History X! Fight Club! Even The Matrix! These movies are all spectacular masterpieces that grip your mind and spirit, and blow LOTR away. It should also be noted that It's always been my view that The Godfather should not be #1 either, but should be right below The Shawshank Redemption. I can only hope that over the next few months the hype will diminish and FOTR will go to it's proper place somewhere in the teens or twenties. See this movie. Enjoy it. But do not forget that it is not perfect. And it is DEFINITELY not deserving of the #1 place  "
40779,tt0120815,Aaron Brock,united states,5,Great starts don't always finish first," While the first twenty minutes (or, for you pedantic moviegoers out there who are going to jump on me for being six minutes off in my assessment, the length of the first scene) of this movie is a brilliant ""chaotic and harrowing battle scene"", there is nothing else in the movie that even comes close its poignance. The rest of the movie follows in the footsteps of every other trite Spielberg drama. I think that people are too afraid of besmirching the face of any movie that deals with WWII to be honest about films such as this. The subject matter does not make the art. It American audiences are unable to make such a distinction.  "
16975,tt0137523,Aaron Burch,united states,10,in a word .......... wow," I saw Fight Club some time last year and it instantly became my favorite movie of all time. One of the most compelling and intelligently written stories to come out of a Hollywood production ..........EVER!! This rates higher than Pulp Fiction or Se7en for me and that's saying a lot. This and American History X really made me see Edward Norton in a different light. I don't want to ruin it for you but suffice to say it's on of the best twist endings ever. Should you see it, I also recommend picking up the book as it explains more about project mayhem and provides a completely different ending but one just as satisfying. I don't want to make this review too long so I will close with this. If you see one new movie this year, make it Fight Club. You won't be disappointed.  "
7671,tt0468569,Aaron Burgin (aburgin43),united states,10,"One of the best films ever, not just comic book films","When it comes to comic book films, there is no competition: The Dark Knight is the greatest comic-book adaptation ever, blowing the runners-up (Spider-Man 2, Iron Man and X-Men United) out of the water. But this is not what The Dark Knight aspires to be. It aspires to be the most ambitious, the most artful and simply one of the greatest cinematic achievements ever. And I believe it succeeds. Powerful acting performances are embodied by the late Heath Ledger's simply awe-inspiring performances as the psychotic anarchist, The Joker. Like other comic-book aficionados, this critic has been waiting for this Joker for a long time. True, Jack Nicholson's performance as Batman's arch rival was iconic, but Ledger's disturbing portrayal of the villain will go down as one of the greatest villain performances of all time, up there with Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates and John ""Jack"" Torrance. You leave the theater truly fearful of the possibility that somewhere in the world there is a human being out there capable of such cruelty against their fellow man. Christian Bale is again perfect in the role as the Caped Crusader, essentially eclipsing Michael Keaton as the face of the genre, and Aaron Eckhart is underrated in his portrayal of Harvey ""Two Face"" Dent. He deserves a supporting actor nod. Everything about this movie exudes excellence. From its amazing cinematography to its realistic action. This movie feels like it can truly happen in real life, and when art imitates life to this extent, it goes beyond a typical movie-viewing experience. For those who saw the film this weekend, we witnessed arguably the greatest action film of the past three generations. "
128647,tt0074958,Aaron Campos (darkknightof1939@cs.com),united states,10,Tremendous," In a 1970's review, who's author I'm at an unfortunate loss to recall, it was prophecized that Network would be a huge commercial smash. Imagine that! Could a movie like this woo modern crowds who labor under the belief that by simply being enjoyable a movie is worthy? No. There is a pleasant lack of what in modern terms could be considered ""commercial appeal"", in fact there is not even a score to manipulate our emotions as the director sees fit, which alone merits praise. Our latter day Athenian crowds squeal like indignant pigs when their vices are questioned (""If you don't like it, leave America""), but regardless it should be done in the spirit of satire, at least. How wonderful then that Paddy Chayefsky does an extraordinary job. Yes, maybe the message will fall on deaf ears, as another review has stated. Perhaps we have embraced Jerry Springer as ""a crazy uncle"", and badly staged sex scenes on tv still makes us grunt like pigs in estrus; as long as there are people of reason, the truth of Chayefsky's indictment will not fade away. I believe that credit for the success of the picture can be divided equally among the Writer, the cast, and the director( yes, Hollywood folk out there who read this. The credit should not be the director, the cast, and then-lastly-the Writer), who perform their duties with the skill much lacking in the younger filmmakers of today. *sigh* Now if only ageism could be abolished in Hollywood, the teen demographic utterly forgotten, and innovative ideas given their day instead of being rewritten to be safe, yawn inducing cliches by illiterate ""writers"" with an eye toward a new Lexus.... Enjoy this crown jewel of cinema that could only have been made in the 70's, a great decade for movies. It did not earn Best Picture, of course(Rocky did) which I'd call it a crime, but given that the Academy of Motion Pictures has also awarded How Green Was My Valley Best Picture in the same year as the release of Citizen Kane, never gave Hitchcock an award, nor Stanley Kubrick, and among other laughable deeds gave Julia Roberts an oscar over Ellen Burstyn, the academy has rendered itself obsolete in mine eye.  "
107296,tt0993846,Aaron Caudill,united states,5,Only for the morally bankrupt....,"My girlfriend and I went to see this movie when it was in theaters. We met a friend there who was visiting from out of town and he paid for our tickets. Despite that being the situation, my girlfriend, exercising better judgment that I, leaned over to me and whispered ""I can't sit here and watch this trash"". I was immediately moved by her moral gesture and decided to follow her out, with our friend staying behind to watch the rest. We had only gotten about 30 minutes in. But it was more than enough. I have never seen anything so raunchy from a Hollywood film, especially in theaters. To be honest, I recently let my curiosity get the best of me and I watched a bit more of it on Netflix but it left me feeling the same way as before. I had to rate it at least 5 stars because after all, you can't rate every movie you dislike one star as though its the worst film ever made, nor can you rate every good movie a ten. I does have a lot of really talented actors and it was a visually well made, high budget movie so 5 stars feel fair. If they limited the F bombs to a reasonable level and left out the ""just short of porn"" sex scenes then I would have really liked this film. However, it's just so filthy and raunchy, it's insulting. They can't go more than a sentence without saying the F-word. The over the top sex scenes and overall crudeness of the movie gets old very fast and your just sitting there like ""oh come on! seriously?!"" It seems as though Leo DiCaprio can't do a movie anymore unless he's playing a despicable foul mouthed pig. I'm not someone who won't watch a movie because of language or violence or nudity, but this movie is just so over the top that I can't sit through it and feel good about myself. If you have no moral boundaries and no ethical compass, and nothing bothers or offends you, then this is probably a highly entertaining and enjoyable movie. I'm sure if I spoke like the characters in this film and lived a shameless existence like them, I would probably be writing a very different review. But thankfully I'm not like them and I can thank my conscience for that.  "

The casting is almost perfect for their parts. I don't like spoiling movies so I'm just going to leave all of it there. This movie still is kinda of like a roller coaster ride, but one that is somewhat slow and you enjoy the hour that you're on it. Unlike most other movies where the hour is too fast and it feels like its never going to end. The pacing, casting, acting, cinematography is all great. Who knew the genius behind reservoir dogs could still have some good creativity inside of him. I know it sounds like i'm praising too much and everything.

149130,tt0401792,Aaron Diamond,united states,10,"UNREAL, perfect Graphic Novel feel","WOW, possibly one of the best adaptations of a Graphic Novel I have ever watched! So excited to see where they take this, as there is a juicy story that has a lot of room for growth. Mickey Rourke is such a classy actor. I have always admired his talents, but this role is so epic for him. I honestly do not believe anyone could have done it better. It is a great role for Clive Owen, kind of upset they replaced him with Hawk in the latest film, but his character is such a powerhouse. Brit Murphy nails her role too, and it was the last film I ever saw of hers. It acts as a great memorial for her career. Rob Rod is such a visionary. I love his style, and I think it fits so perfectly in the realm of graphic novels. His big explosions and blood obsession makes it a giant film with so much action. Never a dull moment. Nailed it!

93968,tt0372784,Aaron Duran (aduran@geekinthecity.com),united states,9,Batman Begins - About time!,"'Bout damn time! As expected from a film with the word ""begins"" in its title, Batman Begins attempts to reset the Batman film franchise, effectively ignoring all the previous Batman films. Nolan and his crew perform this task perfectly. Not wasting a moment, the film opens with the newly launched DC logo then fades directly into a dark Warner Bros shield, which promptly explodes into thousands of bats. With this simple 10-second moment, the mood of the film is set. Billionaire Bruce Wayne's past is told in a series of flashbacks while being trained in the far off corners of Asian by the enigmatic Ducard (played perfectly by Liam Neeson) and long time Batvillain Ras Al Ghul (played by the talented Ken Wanatabe). For the first time ever in a Batman film we see that Bruce's parents are loving and caring individuals that not only love their son without question, but also deeply and truly wish to make Gotham City a better place for all its citizens. As such, the pivotal moment in Crime Alley is all the more terrible. Even though I knew the moment was coming, I still found myself cringing during the deadly mugging of Thomas and Martha Wayne. Nolan did an amazing job in creating real fear and pain in a scene that I have read literally thousands of times over. In fact, Nolan's direction through the entire film creates the greatest rendition of the Dark Knight ever put to the screen, small or large. Bale takes on the daunting task of creating a believable Bruce Wayne and Batman, a task he performs stunningly well. I have often stated that the only way to make Batman succeed is to have a perfectly acted Bruce Wayne, for he is the true mask. Bale is without a doubt the greatest Bruce Wayne. He is, at any given moment, the aloof billionaire playboy only to switch gears into the dark shadows of a man still wracked with pain and anger at the loss of his parents; as Batman, Nolan is able to channel his terror only before seen in American Psycho. There are moments in the film where the audience is truly intimidated by Batman. I would even go so far as to say that I found myself feeling sorry for the crooks of Gotham, when I wasn't clapping or grinning like a mad fan-boy. Michael Caine brings much needed depth and life to the character of Alfred Pennyworth. Ever more so then Bruce Wayne's butler, Alfred is the father figure that Bruce long ago lost in the bowels of Gotham, although he never over steps his bounds. Caine perfectly captures the wry humor that keeps an ever deeply brooding Bruce Wayne grounded. Rounding out this stellar cast is Gary Oldman as Sgt. Gordon who does a wonderful job of bringing Gotham's only good cop to honest life and I am deeply looking forward to more Gordon in future Batman films. Morgan Freeman as the business and tech savvy Luscious Fox, an old friend of Thomas Wayne and the man who holds the ideals of Wayne Enterprises long after his friend passed on. Cillian Murphy brings just enough analytical arrogance and flat out insanity to the part of Jonathan Crane, also known as the Scarecrow. Murphy perfectly plays a man barely hanging onto his own sanity. A man who takes true visceral pleasure out of the fear of others. Liam Neeson perfectly plays Ducard, a man who sees a potential prot«∏g«∏ in Bruce Wayne. Neeson is able to take the now familiar role of wizened adviser and make it something completely different, even a tad sinister. I even found myself pleasantly surprised by the acting of Katie Holmes in the role of Rachael Dawson, assistant D.A. in Gotham City. While I don't completely feel her role was needed, it was not distracting and Katie's character is so much more then eye candy, unlike her predecessors in Kim Basinger or Nicole Kidman. Speaking of Gotham City, it is wonderful to see a Gotham that looks like an actual city. While I loved the work that Anton Furst did in Burton's Batman, it always felt like style over substance. Nolan's Gotham is real. She is a city that is alive, if sick and slowly dying from within. The Gotham City of Batman Begins is the city I had always envisioned Gotham to look (although I was hoping for a couple of GCPD blimps, maybe in the next film). I have often stated that films like Spiderman 2, Superman, and Hellboy worked because they weren't afraid to be a comic book films. That acknowledging the comic book world in which these stories reside is the only way such films can work. Batman Begins breaks that mold. True, Batman is a comic book character. True that Gotham City is a fake city in a fake world. However, Batman Begins is not a comic book movie. No, Batman Begins is a deeply moving and engrossing action / drama film that just so happens to draw its inspiration from a 66-year-old comic book icon. Batman Begins has some flaws, no that is not true, Batman Begins has some minor quips, but that doesn't stop me from claiming here and now that Batman Begins is the BEST comic book film yet made and quite possibly one of the best films of 2005∂? 5 out of 5 critical hits.

108508,tt0434409,Aaron Eamer (eamer-v2),united kingdom,9,"Perfect, Amazing, Must See",V For Vendetta was one of the movies which I wasn't sure about but knew I had to see anyway. I was really hopeful that it would be a good movie and I was not disappointed one bit. V For Vendetta is an amazing movie. Hugo Weaving puts on a brilliant performance. Having to wear a mask through the whole film you expect the acting to be second degree but his body language shows his emotions perfectly and you don't even notice that the mask has a huge smile on it because of the body language and how well Weaving makes sure the audience know what mood his character is in for each scene. I was glad that Weaving's character 'V' never actually took his mask off. There was one point I was worried the mask was going to come off and show a really bad make up job but the mask wasn't taken off and kept him mysterious like he was throughout until that point. Natalie Portman does a good job putting on an English accent and did really well in the shaved head scene which obviously they only had one chance to do. You couldn't have asked more from her and her performance is flawless. To kiss a mask as well and make it look convincing was a hard job but she did that perfect too. The film is brilliant and I couldn't have asked for more. I haven't seen many films twice at the Cinema before but I may well go see this one again soon. It also makes me want to read the Comic series. Highly Recommended.

66539,tt1345836,Aaron French,united kingdom,10,Best film of 2012 so far?,"The Dark Knight Rises, as most know, is the finale of Chrisopher Nolan's Batman trilogy that began with Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. You have to ask yourself though, is the series plagued? I saw this in light of recent events with the Colorado shootings and Heath Ledger's untimely death in 2008. However, The Dark Knight Rises is THE movie to watch in 2012: It features stunning performances from Christian Bale who reprises his role as the protagonist Batman, Anne Hathaway as Catwomen and namely Michael Caine's portrayal of Bruce's servant Alfred. Caine gives an excellent performance in the movie mainly an emotional moment towards the closing scenes of the film (no spoilers here). Tom Hardy's performance as the villain Bane arguably competes with Ledger's performance as The Joker in The Dark Knight, You can feel the terror that Bane inflicts. The story itself (whilst giving away no spoilers) features plenty of emotional moments and plot twists galore, 10/10 from this reviewer. Summary: One of the best films this year has scene, definitely beating The Amazing Spider Man, where Super-Hero movies of 2012 are concerned: See this movie!   "

The plot to this movie isn't even that important: the way the characters react and the tone of the thing, that's what draws you into this piece. It is blissfully bizarre and probably belongs up there with Altman's The Long Goodbye and Polanski's Chinatown as a wonderful snapshot of Los Angeles wrapped in a private-eye story. Again, it isn't a riddle to be solved, just movie entertainment at its best. The initial ""mystery"" of this story is about as important to the final film as the initial ""who stole the truck"" business in the beginning of The Usual Suspects. Forget about it and listen to the Dude sponging-up vocabulary, Walter chastizing pascifism, and poor Donny always six steps behind, out of his element. Like all the Coen Brother's films, this one gets better with repeat viewings to catch every nuance in performance, dialogue, cinematography, etc. Jeff Bridges gives his best performance since Fearless.

Blade Runner has, of course, gotten its due over the years, but The Thing still hides in relative obscurity (perhaps in one of us...get the flame- thrower!). While not as groundbreaking a classic as Ridley Scott's masterpiece, it's certainly worth repeated viewings. It is a good ol' fashioned scary movie, and certainly Carpenter's best work. If you've only seen in on TV with commercials or on cable a dozen years ago, see it again (if possible a wide screen copy as Carpenter used the 2.35:1 screen beautifully to create a mood and place). No stupid cop-out endings or cheesy one-liners here, just great storytelling. Best seen at night, during a snowstorm, with the lights and heat turned off.  "

I can recall the first time I saw it, in 1985 or so, after it had come out on video. I was about 5 or 6 years old then. I had seen C.H.U.D., a couple of Nightmare on Elm Streets, and even a Friday the 13th or so, but not a single one of them had scared me. This film changed that (to this day). This is the only film to have put a little fright into me. Back when you had to think of special effect (instead of having one guy with a vivid imagination, and 124 computer geeks-like today) this film maximises a lot out of a little. A great story, good acting, and a satisfied customer - three things that rarely go together when discussing horror films.   "
5503,tt0071562,Aaron Gillette (leperish),united states,10,"Certinly the best sequel ever made, and arguably the best film ever.","As a huge fan of the Godfather series, (yes I even like part three) I have to say that part two is my personal favorite. Part one shows us the title of Godfather being passed from Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) to his son Michael (Al Pacino).  The second film begins with Vito as a young boy being smuggled out of Sicily after his entire family was murdered by the local mafia. Then the story re-joins Michael in his now powerful position as mafia Don, and head of the Corleone family.  The film is divided into sections of the present-day story of Michael trying to gear the family to bigger deals in Cuba with his fathers old partner Hyman Roth (Lee Strasberg) while also dealing with the uprising of the Cuban rebels; and the betrayal of his brother Fredo (John Cazale). One of the great scenes is when he gives Fredo the ""kiss of death"" at the New Year's party.  The other section of the film is comprised of a young Vito (as played by Robert De Niro) making his way in old town New York. It shows his way up the organized crime ladder, making friends and connections that would later (and earlier) carry the story.  Francis Ford Coppola delivers masterful genius in this epic reprisal of a gangster classic. He uses soft, brown textures and dull sepia tones to perfection. The lighting has yet to be duplicated in any film. The way some of these shots are framed have been studied in film schools the world over. In short, if your looking for the epitamy of cinematic enjoyment mixed with that good ole' classic gangster violence, this is the movie for you. I would recommend it to anyone. "

Bruce Willis also does an excellent job, and the resulting chemistry between the two actors is fantastic. M. Night Shyamalan's screenplay also deserves an Oscar nomination, and will probably get it.

27715,tt0167261,Aaron Justice,poland,10,Applause they did...," *spoilers, beware* For my birthday I saw The Two Towers with about ten of my friends. Never before have I seen such an unbelievable spectacle of cinema accomplishment. My biggest problem with the whole movie was some of the shots of the hobbits on the shoulders of Treebeard. That's about it. Gimli, the stout little dwarf who was pretty much in the shadows last time, is now out in front with his quirky and very funny scenes. There was hardly a scene in which the surly ""man"" didn't give a laugh. Dead wargs piling on top of him, his complaint of a lack of a view at Helm's Deep, and his unbelievably humorous shot of him gouging a berserker Uruk-Hai in the crotch with his axe. THAT'S funny. I was so pleased with Gollum. He interacted so perfectly with the live actors it was hard to looks at him and remind yourself he wasn't real. The close-ups on his face are what give him such a dimension of a real, physical character. Yes, Dobby and Yoda did look quite good in their respective movies (Harry 2 and Star Wars 2) but Gollum not only looked better, he performed much better. See the movie to understand what I mean. Well, I have found two other complaints. Merry and Pippin were virtually forgotten in this movie. Their scenes were almost as if they were put in only because they had to. Also the overall feel to the movie made it drift away from the first, and sometimes, even though I have read the books and seen the first movie quite a few times, I found myself somewhat lost or puzzled by the movie. However, this movie was filled with scenes that more than made up for the weak points of the movie. Depending on what kind of movie you prefer, this movie is better than the first. If you like the first one better, that's because these two movies share almost nothing in common, and I understand why some people liked the first one better. However, other than the first movie, there is one thing that I have never heard in a movie theater, and I've seen nearly every worthwhile movie since Gladiator. Applause. The theater erupted in applause by the film's end. That is the testament of the strength of this series, and may The Return of the King prove us all wrong that movie making can't get any better than this. 10/10.  "
20537,tt0120737,Aaron Justice (aaronjustice),united states,10,"Best movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of movies"," I came with three friends to see this movie, and all four of us left agreeing it is the best movie we have ever seen. I was disturbed when a commentor below said it would become an obscure movie that will go alongside movies like Willow and The Dark Crystal. Last time I checked, those movies aren't streaking towards earning 300 million or more dollars and becoming #1 at the IMDB top 250. If over 70% of the people who have seen this movie left feeling the movie they saw was a 10 out of 10, then obviously this is a very good movie. Those who don't like it probably hate it without reason, or they have an agenda. Anti-Tolkieners. I was never a big fan of Tolkien either, but I recently read the books, and they are very good.  "
67684,tt0169547,Aaron Kardon,United States,10,Movie of the year," The movie American Beauty is probably the best movie that i have seen all summer. The movie is very deep in much of its meaning while it still is able to be enjoyed at face value. I believe that Kevin Spacey performed his finest performance since the usual suspects, and this is a definate reflection on the ability of the rest of the cast. Not to mention that this was a very well directed movie in that it showed the life of the average everyday family in a twisted view, which to some extent is an accurate depiction of the people in the society. If you see this movie though, I will warn you that the movie is not exactly for everyone based on content, but there was a lot that can be learned in this movie. If I were to compare American Beauty to any movie, I would have to cross Falling Down, together with war of the roses and to some extent some American History X, but this movie is unique in what it has done. I hope that this picture, like Pulp Fiction in 1994, is nominated for best picture, because this movie was brilliant in every way.   "
24052,tt0109830,Aaron Kinney,united states,9,One of the greatest films I have ever seen,"This film should have a rating of more than 8.3. In my opinion it deserves almost a 9.0. Very few of the films I have ever seen can make me weep like Forrest Gump. It also portrays the 1960s and 1970s for what they are infamous for, hippies, peace, love, protest and war. Forrest grows up a simple child but grows into a mature and loving person. Hanks was ideal for this role. His childhood friend, ""Jenny"", who he remained for most of his life, he loved, and sadly, she didn't always treat him how she should've. Still to this day, I remember this to be so realistic and I actually thought to myself, ""why did she do this to him?"" Never before (or maybe ever again) has a film like ""Forrest Gump"" made me think to myself and apply to a fictional film such a realistic question. It's almost as if it actually took place. The bonds that two simple men had while in the military, Blue and Forrest, was incredible. While neither of them were very smart, they both were very kind and they formed a friendship that lasted until they parted. I cried not only at that, but also at the death of Sally Field's character and Jenny. No, I didn't cry once, but several times. We have a lot to learn from this film. Not only the horrors of war, but also the importance of love and compassion. That's why I gave it a 9. Bravo.  "
40626,tt0120815,Aaron Kinney,united states,9,"Very, very sad film","I have seen many World War II films, many of them very well written and acted out, but few measure up to the class of Saving Private Ryan. The film's gore, language, among other vulgarities are extremely well represented, but it is the end that got me. During the final scenes of the movie, when Hanks and his men have fought a hard and difficult battle, Hanks' character John Miller has been mortally wounded and dies in the arms of one of his soldiers; incidentally, the man he and his squad rescued, James Ryan. Ryan returns to the grave of his superior officer years later, salutes, and the legacy of a heroic soldier remains, though he has been dead for decades. A film that made me weep like never before. A nine out of 10 in my book.  "
109772,tt0434409,Aaron Kinney,united states,8,Anarchist and terrorist propaganda,"In 2006 this film was voted by the Christian Film and Television Commission the ""most anti-Christian"" film of the year. I can see why. This film promotes using terrorism when the government does something you disagree with, it promotes anarchism (just look at the DVD jacket), and shows disregard for traditional standards. And what a perfect time to release a movie glorifying terrorism, right when we are fighting the insurgency in Iraq and attempting to spread democracy. And the quote of this film, when the ""V"" character introduces himself to the girl he rescues. Give me a break! Every word in his introduction begins with a ""v"". It's pure stupidity and the writers for this film did a mediocre job. Finally, Hollywood's political views are unleashed upon the world in the form of a revolutionary and radical film. I didn't watch it, I don't want to, and I don't even believe it is deserving of a 1/10.  "
143772,tt0032138,Aaron Kinney,united states,3,"Revolutionized the media, let's let it go.","I realize that this film was the first influentially shot in technicolor and everything and that it revolutionized the cinema and drama media, but to be honest, I've been drilled with this movie at school and at home to the extent I am not flattered by this film anymore. It's been shown way too many times and honestly, it gets old. Not to mention the fairy tale and ""Oz"" environment, which, as a child scared me a little, and I couldn't see how any children could find this film entertaining. One of the few definitive moments of film, however, was Margaret Hamilton's portrayal of the Wicked Witch of the West. A genuine performance fueled upon stereotypes never ceases to be entertaining. Sadly, I think they blew it when they made me watch it every year in art class during middle school.  "
14945,tt0167260,Aaron Lawrence,new zealand,7,Extended Edition is definitive,"Return of the King, Extended Edition, is a decent improvement on the theatrical release, except for a couple of small mis-steps. The EE improves the flow of the story immensely, succinctly explaining a lot of points that before seemed a little arbitrary. It extends some crucial parts of the movie to greatly improve the sense of time passing, such as Frodo and Sam crossing Mordor. It includes the much-missed conclusion to Saruman and Wormtongue's story - not in the same style as the book, which depended on the unfilmed (and unfilmable) Scouring of the Shire, but in an appropriate way that stays true to the spirit of the book. (In fact this scene is a good example of the very effective way that the writers collapsed multiple book scenes into one movie scene. Kudos.) The extended cut also gives a lot more personality and interest to some characters; notably Denethor, Steward of Gondor, but others as well. The battles feel more grueling due to subtle extensions here and there. It's still not quite perfect; I still think the role of the dead army was too much, detracting from the efforts of the living warriors. This was probably not easily correctable in the EE, since it would have meant filming some quite substantial additional battle scenes, and further the writers had clearly made a decision to go away from the book version here. Still, I would like to see that improved somehow. The Paths of the Dead itself is extended, but most of this is unnecessary and frankly cheap. Looking back now, the theatrical edition is much superior both for suspense and lack of cheese. I would rather have seen the spooky and sad scene with Bregor's (?) skeleton lying at a the sealed door of some unknown chamber. And if I'm getting fussy, a bit more actual darkness would be nice! There are other niggles, but they decrease in importance and probably only reflect my opinions and personal vision of LotR. In terms of story balance, the EE of RotK was what should have been originally released to theatres. Unfortunately, this would have been impossible as it is an hour longer, and many casual viewers already found it much too long. In any case, the final Extended Edition of Return of the King is absolutely stunning. Where I had previously felt the movie strayed a little too far into traditional ""Hollywood blockbuster"" territory, the EE now feels balanced, complete, and above all moving and true to the spirit of the book. I thank Mr Jackson, New Line Cinema, JRR Tolkien and everyone else who contributed. For myself, this is the best series of films ever made, and I am quite happy to call Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King a masterpiece, as is the book it was based upon. Film and book snobs be damned, this is an amazing movie.  "
49140,tt0047396,Aaron Lawrence,new zealand,6,"Technically strong, great performances, but bland story and very weak ending","I was disappointed with this movie. For reference, I really liked Vertigo which delivered a really interesting story with great characters and direction. In Rear Window, the characters are well defined and sharply delivered. My only quibble here is that it was virtually impossible to see why Lisa was interested in Jeff (other than some clich«∏ about opposites attracting). I understand that it was a nice study of various human behaviours and foibles, but that is not enough to make a great movie; it needs a plot, and the plot here was meandering and ultimately clich«∏d. I was very entertained for the first half of the movie, especially with the interplay between the two leads; then I got tired of following the increasingly silly murder clues. Unfortunately it finishes with a completely unrealistic and overacted ""confrontation"", with some crude overused visual effects (long before CGI!), and worse, it confirms that the fairly dull and obvious conclusion that was reached very early on was in fact correct. My reaction at the end was: Oh. Is that it? I wouldn't say the movie is boring, though it is rarely exciting and moves slowly. I realise I am in the minority of IMDb voters (although oddly there is a little clump of less-than-glowing reviews at the very end of the review list on IMDb). But I do think that those who rate this as near movie perfection are probably over-emphasising Hitchcock's undoubted directorial skills and ignoring weaknesses in the story and delivery.  "
141364,tt0246578,Aaron Lawrence,new zealand,8,Director's Cut: a little less powerful,"I loved the original, so I snapped up the director's cut DVD when it came out. I have to say that, although some bits of it were interesting, in most respects the original was more powerful. ** possible spoilers ahead ** The DC integrates some deleted scenes, some musical changes and some new visual effects, including pages from the ""time travel book"". The deleted scenes are OK, but frankly not especially noticeable, and certainly don't change anything of significance. In this case, it seems most of the deletions were good editing choices in the original. The added visual effects mainly consist of some computer generated 2d images of some kind of computer or visual interface which is meant to be in control of what is happening. The graphics ranged from mildly interesting (an eye, waves) to extremely cheesy (flashing English words!). In particular, the ""purge"" sequence seems totally inappropriate and low-tech. Seeing an English word on a fairly basic looking windows-like interface... that's not exactly what you'd expect from some kind of higher being(s) modifying the universe! I listened to the director's explanation of the graphics and his ideas for the science-fiction element, and I came to the conclusion that there was a certain amount of luck in the original edit managing to reveal just enough; once you heard it explained it really wasn't as interesting as you might imagine. For instance, the idea of God actually being involved is fairly clearly stamped out by the technological flavour. The musical changes were fine with me. The opening song (INXS, Never Tear Us Apart), I liked. I thought that fitted just as well or better than the original choice. Selected pages of the time travel book mentioned in the original are shown in full, overlaid/interwoven with other scenes. These were mildly interesting, but seemed quite intrusive to me. They were clearly just added over top and didn't need to be there. They also seemed a little simplistic or matter-of-fact for what seems quite a mind-bending story. Generally, I prefer director's cuts (ex: Bladerunner, LOTR) but not in this case. Stick with the original. This is only really worthwhile for completeness.  "

It conveys better than any film to have come before, and I believe that will ever come in the future, that war is hell on earth. An absolute must see for anyone remotely interested in movies. You'll wince, you'll cry, and at times you'll barely be able to process what's transpiring on screen, but you'll know that you're seeing an unrivaled masterpiece. It is the greatest war movie ever made, BY FAR. Nothing else even comes close. It is also one of the best films ever made. I believe it is in the top 5. It certainly rests firmly in good company in my opinion. I have heard many people complain that it is heavy handed, and that it uses overwhelming images to bash the audience into submission. This is an absurd notion. Whoever heard of war being subtle?   "
94960,tt0372784,Aaron Martin- Colby,united states,5,Immense disappointment,"While I am sure anything I say will not dissuade the Batman faithful from seeing the movie, I warn you, steel yourselves to be very disappointed. The movie was a catastrophe for the first hour, and then became merely adequate. They screwed around with the characters greatly, totally changing Ra's Al Ghul AND the Scarecrow (And for those who know how to pronounce Ra's, the movie will be painful). I won't even go into how idiotic the Ra's character was. The scarecrow character was alright. Cilian Murphy gave a better performance than I expected and I liked it. Still, the deviation from the comic roots was a disappointment for one so in love with them. The movie seems to have no clue how to start, and yet it doesn't start in medias res either. It just stumbles to its feet like a drunk and slowly sobers up as it walks home. Bruce does a number of things near the beginning without motivation, and then continues to do silly things for the whole of the movie. None of the actions had weight to them, and the whole first hour seemed like a perfunctory advertisement to lead us into the real movie. And the script, HA, it's a joke. A very bad, two hour long joke. There are a number of plot holes involving the microwave gun, which is stupid in and of itself, and the bulk of the characters are incredibly one dimensional. The first hour reads like an extended trailer, where the writers tried to wring out some Shakespearean quote from EVERY scene. A silly script isn't bad, since it is based on a comic book and they're usually rather silly by nature, but the movie takes itself so seriously that the silliness is exaggerated. There are no moments of goofy mirth a la Peter Parker trying to shoot webbing for the first time, and they seemed to try and make up for this with one-too-many ""hyuck"" lines during the car chase. The script manages to move slowly, yet also not have that much happen, and also seem rushed at the same time. A truly noteworthy feat. The acting is a bright spot. All performances are adequate. As usual, Morgan Freeman gives the strongest performance and is a breath of fresh air compared to the other raspy, bland performances. Unfortunately, you don't get to see him too frequently. And about Ken Watanabe, why in the world did they even INCLUDE him in the credits? He is on screen, I kid you not, for no more than two minutes. Katie Holmes was dreadfully miscast. She has no on-screen presence and is overshadowed. There are a number of B-list hotties in Hollywood that could have filled the required shoes much better. Michael Caine is enjoyable as usual, Liam Neeson is adequate, and Gary Oldman is good. I think I enjoyed Gary Oldman the most because, for once, he's not playing a bad guy. Which is just cool. The directing is like an ADD child got a hold of the camera. There are way too many cuts, and the fight scenes are so jittery and cut-up you can't tell what the hell is going on. Keep a shot for more than 5 seconds, for the love of Pete! This was, I feel, the biggest disappointment. While the script sucked, I don't expect much from David S. Goyer. I do expect a lot from Chris Nolan. ""Memento"" was great, and ""Insomnia"" was also very good. Let us hope this is the low point of Nolan's career. In what is probably the greatest strike against the film, I am also a die-hard Batman fan, and was disappointed with how they mangled the comic's storyline. I am not against this, though. Tim Burton mangled the story for his Batman movies, yet I liked them a lot. It was the combination of a directing style that just doesn't float my boat, a script with dialogue that feels disconnected and without weight, Katie Holmes, and a disappointing turn with Ra's Al Ghul. I know I continue to harp on him, but he was one of my favorite characters in the history of the comic, and I was very disappointed in his portrayal. In short, the script was overblown and self-important. The fight choreography is bad. The Batmobile looks like soft-core porn from a survivalist magazine (Roger Ebert described it as a Hummer's wet dream). The casting was uninspired, and most of the performances weren't stellar (If nothing else this movie confirms that Katie Holmes can, indeed, not act). The directing was serviceable for most parts, but all in all was not up to par. I can say this, it was at least better than ""Batman and Robin."" Although that's not hard.  "

I want AN ending. Any ending. The ending is the most important part of a film. It sticks with you in ways the rest of the film doesn't. Chinatown's ending sticks with me, but it does so for the wrong reason. I have the same problem with 'The French Connection.' It WASN'T an ending! It just went along, then stopped. Like the editor sneezed while splicing film. Nicholson's character persists in the investigation even when he doesn't need to. I'm sorry, but there's no chance he wouldn't have persisted after the events in the last scenes. The movie failed to end. It just stopped two or three scenes before the actual end. It annoyed me to the point of growling. Is the movie brilliant? Yes. Is the movie a classic? Yes. Is the movie annoying? Hell yes! I don't care if everyone ends up dead and LA burns to the ground and the last shot is of crying babies burning on spikes, it's at least a real ending with no loose ends. Loose ends in a bad movie are derided, loose ends in this movie and it's called a masterpiece? No. It doesn't work that way. I adored every frame until the last scene, when the loose ends burned like fiery wicks into my soul. I want to give the movie a much lower score... but... I... can't. The rest of the movie is just too damned good. But the ending killed it for me. I could never watch it again.  "

This movie is a must see at the theater in 3D, plus the story is very entertaining which definitely makes a worthwhile movie experience(and at $16 dollars for the movie ticket that was no easy task). The computer animation was done very well for this movie and you get to see the impressive effects right from the beginning of the movie. They show where the Vikings live from the ocean view and the ocean almost looks lifelike and with the 3D effect it looks like you are right there on the water.

17113,tt0137523,Aaron Mullally,canada,9,An under appreciated masterpiece.," An interesting adaptation from the book. Both are good, but don't see one without reading the other. What Fight Club so intelligently and refreshingly acknowledges about being a young man in today's world more than makes up for the movies' shortcomings. Let's face it: we're all mortgaging the happiness of our souls by working jobs we don't really like. We do this in exchange for the opportunity buy crap we hope will self express ourselves and makes us feel unique...just like everyone else. The vicious cycle is causing us more harm than any of us want to admit. We're are too afraid to break it, so we carry on and continue our search for whatever coping mechanisms help us deal with it. Then along came Fight Club. For the first time (as far as I know) somebody found a novel way to talk about it. And overcoming the fear of fist fighting with total strangers couldn't be more brilliant as the ultimate coping mechanism. My biggest complaint about this movie was that it was too stylized - so much so that I couldn't help but think some might accuse its anti-consumerism rants of being somewhat hypocritical. Sure Brad Pitt looked like a dirty scum bag, but that was a carefully contrived ""scum style"" you were looking at. Notwithstanding those subtle dashes of Hollywood that, to me, seemed to sober the movies' message, both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton gave fantastic, believable performances. They helped make this story, this idea, a highly authentic experience. I am actually quite surprised this movie didn't create more buzz when it was in theatres. I can see the back half of the movie might have been where many people started to lose interest (I admit it weakens as the whole Project Mayhem stuff unfolds), but that first sixty minutes is all you really need to see as far as I'm concerned. The power of that piece alone leads me to believe that Fight Club is one seriously under appreciated movie. I think its legacy will start to shine the more we reflect on what it had to say. Give it a second try, and give it time.    "
125704,tt0469494,Aaron Muse,united states,10,A Burning Descent Into Madness,"The film is simply perfect in every way, every scene, every note and every facet of all the actors performances are spot on. Day-Lewis presents a character in Daniel Plainview of unrelenting maliciousness, not quite as sadistic as Bardem's Anton Chirurgh but every bit a villain through and through. What makes Daniel Plainview more horrifying than any other villain I've come across is just how much of myself I saw in his character. This film made me want to be a better person not through guilting me into loving my fellow man, but by simply showing the life of a man who never changed and alienated all who loved him. Here is a man that never evolves and experiences no epiphany, he stays the same miserable bastard that he's always been and its just so refreshing to see that in a character. Too much these days we as film goers are forced to sit through contrived character changes or realizations that come out of nowhere and only serve to insult the audience. People don't change and here is a film thats not afraid to express that in the most brutal way possible. Plainview hates people and wants success in business only so he can make enough money to escape them. Making money it turns out, is very easy for him, he has a way of speaking and carrying himself that is hypnotic and convincing even when you know you're being lied too. He's an oil man but he just as easily could've made his fortune in silver or gold or the blood of children, his ruthlessness would not have stopped him. And what is oil if not the blood of the earth. He finds his fortune somewhere in Texas where he runs afoul of a small-town church whose preacher represents all Plainview hates about the humanity he wishes to escape from. The young Paul Dano gives the best supporting performance of the year as Eli Sunday, the preacher and faith healer of the church and the symbol of Plainview hatred for years. Throughout the film the two characters run afoul several times with Plainview only building up his hatred over time, for Eli, and for everyone around him. There has been much uproar over the film's ending, many call it 'over-the-top' or unreal. Yes, the ending is insane, maddening and gruesome, and it is perfect. No other ending could possibly due given this character and his personality and all the decisions he has made in his life up to that crucial point in time (and given the title). The conclusion to the film is unsettling but its exactly what has been building and building the entirety of Daniel's life and its the only ending that could have done this story justice. The film works like a slow burning fire beneath the surface. The tension and the intensity just builds up until the climax where all is settled and there is no turning back. Our hero has become the man he was destined to be and there is no one left to help him. Plainview passes that threshold after which its too late to go back and right the wrongs you have committed to yourself and to those who loved you. His slow descent into madness is hard to watch, but whoever said a great film had to be fun to watch. Great art is not always pretty and great characters are not always likable. Those are not proper critiques of this film. There Will Be Blood creates an image of a man who is not perfect, but the image is perfectly created.  "

3053,tt0111161,Aaron Nash,australia,10,As near to perfection as any film has ever been," ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is one of those films that stays with you for life. This is a perfect display of modern film-making with beautiful cinematography and wonderfully narrated by Morgan Freeman.  The story is not an entirely original idea and appears to have borrowed considerably from other films (notably ""Escape from Alcatraz"") but this does not seem to matter, since the most intriguing part of this film is HOW the story is told. With the help of some excellent editing and a heart-warming narration by Morgan Freeman (of course, not forgetting a very-well-written script by director Frank Darabont), the story unfolds in such a manner that will keep you entirely engulfed in the film from start to finish.  There is hardly a fault to be found with this film. The well-fleshed out and believable characters are exquisitely portrayed on the screen, particularly by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins who work brilliantly together. The script is consistently paced but never rushed, allowing the events to unfold. Despite the runtime almost reaching two and a half hours, the film never drags, nor does it feel too long. The cinematography is an absolute treat, with Roger Deakins superbly capturing the colours of mid-20th century America. Perhaps the only flaws that can be found with this fantastic work are the apparent lack of ageing of characters, despite the story taking place over almost twenty years, and the slightly unoriginal (in parts) plot. However, neither of these 'flaws' detract from what this film is - an outstanding piece of storytelling that captures the audience with every image.  ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a perfect display of storytelling and is beautifully uninhibited by the sorts of visual effects that unnecessarily spoil so many films today. But the most important thing about this film is that it is believable and extremely watchable. It is easy for the audience to connect with the characters, and thus - thanks to the excellent acting by Robbins and Freeman in the lead roles - we can feel for them and respond accordingly.  ""The Shawshank Redemption"" - as a masterpiece in storytelling - may never be surpassed. Few films get as close to perfection as this one does; the acting and cinematography, in particular, are absolute joys. Two thumbs up to Frank Darabont and his crew for creating such a wonderful masterpiece that will live in our hearts forever.  ***** out of ***** "

And indescribable is its best description. A movie for your soul. A remote-control car made me laugh. A gun-shot made me cry. And a plastic bag showed me just how unquantifiably beautiful the Universe still is despite us doing our level best to mess is up. The WOW factor for me was that real life in 1999 is so easily painted in what appears to be cartoon form. If you step back from that cartoon, its characters lives with their mixture of the funny, the confused, the sad, and the good and bad, it reveals itself as a mirror of reality. Reality nailed with unnerving ease. Unnerving on one hand but refreshing on another. To see that many of our own personal problems could be solved so easily by ourselves if only we got of our asses and did something about them. Hollywood's version of an Anthony Robbins infomercial? Lester grows like we all would like to. Carolyn loosens up in the best way possible. Jane finds understanding. And Ricky Fitts is our new hero. Where did they get this Wes Bentley from. Finally, for this 'Gen X'er, someone to fill the void left by River Phoenix. Go see this movie. One of the best movies I've ever seen.  "

I enjoyed it when I first watched it and I still enjoy it today. If there was no Metropolis then there would be no Blade Runner or Star Wars. So we all have to thank Metropolis for everything it has done for us. I say you get the Complete Metropolis from Kino International. It will blow you away and the film will make more sense. I recommend to Science-fiction fans or just movie fans in general. It is one Heck of a ride filled with pure entertainment. Some people may dismiss the movie because of the whole point of it being in black in white and silent but that will you use inner imagination to break the silence and fill in the colors. I say you check it out for entertainment. Peace out.  "
125776,tt0469494,Aaron Noonan,ireland,6,A poor idea that is well executed.,"There Will Be Blood is an odd film. So many things about it are extraordinary, but the end product is not. The set piece, the vast landscape of Texas at the turn of the twentieth century is an amazing spectacle, helped by great cinematography. The soundtrack is strange and uncanny, and does greatly add to the atmosphere of the film. It is entirely deserved of its Academy Award. But not much else, from what I can see, is great about this film. It's not a bad film however. I watched this film in February 2011, roughly four years after it came out. When it did come out, it had an uproarious reception with several critics calling it the best movie of that year, even going so far as being deemed as classic. Just a quick look at its Wikipedia article shows the love it has had endowed upon it. This all meant I had very high expectations, and ultimately, it did not even nearly reach them. Set over a thirty one year period, from 1896 to 1927, There Will Be Blood is a story about one man's lust for money. Daniel Plainview is an ambitious man. He is smart, and he is ruthless. He is self made. He has many associates, but he has no friends. Nor does he want any. His only companion is a son called H.W., but H.W. is more of a selling point to Plainview, who wins people over to his ideas by portraying himself as a family man. He uses this methodology when winning over the town of Little Boston to allow him to drill. He promises riches for the town, but all they get is corruption. A young religious pastor named Eli seems to be the only one willing to stand up for anything, but he too lets his lust and greed get to him. This film to me, is an example of one with a poor idea that is well executed. The script isn't great. It's very much all over the place, jumping around back and forth but never really landing anywhere. It starts at the start, but never really ends at the end. Not in such a way as No Country for Old Men or A Serious Man, as both of those films leave you thinking very hard about what the film meant. There Will Be Blood doesn't. Another fault I would find with the script, and possibly a more inimical one, was the development of Plainview's character. The movie is practically a biopic of an imagined character, and he is very well portrayed as a greedy, ambitious, angry man. But that is all. The character never learns anything of his mistakes. Which is all fine and well, because some characters never learn, but when you're expected to invest so much in this one, you expect to be able to relate to him some bit. I couldn't, as Plainview had no soul. He has nobody in his life, and he doesn't yearn for anyone. He's not human. The antidote to Plainview is Eli Sunday, but here is another character that's difficult to love, due to his love of his religion polarized with his own self corruption. Maybe if Plainview didn't need an antidotal character I'd enjoy Eli's character more, but it's sadly not the case. Paul Thomas Anderson masked this poor script very well with above average direction. I cannot fault the direction and cinematography. The costume was wonderful also, I always was a fan of old timey American drab. Daniel Day-Lewis is an extremely good actor and he doesn't let up here, it's just hard to love his character. Which unfortunately is needed in this kind of film. While I might disagree with him sometimes, the great Roger Ebert truly sums up my feelings on this film in the final paragraph of his review: """"There Will Be Blood"" is the kind of film that is easily called great. I am not sure of its greatness. It was filmed in the same area of Texas used by ""No Country for Old Men,"" and that is a great film, and a perfect one. But ""There Will Be Blood"" is not perfect, and in its imperfections (its unbending characters, its lack of women or any reflection of ordinary society, its ending, its relentlessness) we may see its reach exceeding its grasp. Which is not a dishonorable thing."" This movie is by no means bad, but it sought to be greater and more involving than it was.  "
58403,tt0482571,Aaron O'Brien,ireland,9,"Suspenseful, stylish and intelligent.","I was quite interested to see The Prestige, I don't see how you couldn't be with such a great cast and director attached to it. The premise is what completely sold me. I don't think there's enough movies about magic, it can be bad if not done right, but when it's done right I just fall in love, it's just such an interesting subject. The Prestige is a magic movie done right. I love it. The film is about two magicians referred to as Angier and Borden, the two men were once partners and good friends, but after a horrible accident their relationship quickly fades. They're both both brilliant magicians, but Angier knows how to present himself and his tricks with style, and Borden doesn't. Borden is smarter then Angier however, and he constructs the most brilliant trick Angier has ever seen. Angier becomes obsessed with finding out the logic behind his trick, so he himself can perform this trick with the style that he is able to present with, making him the better magician. One thing that The Prestige does well with is magic, which you would expect from a film about magic but some films about magic don't get the whole thing right. What The Prestige does to make magic work well in the film is give logic behind the tricks, if it didn't do that the film would be nowhere near as good as it is. It just adds an extra layer of quality to the film. What I loved the most about The Prestige however was it's story and characters. The story is written with skill and intelligence, it's mind bending and sometimes challenging, but not to the point where you're lost and uninterested as the twists and turns start happening, you just need a good attention span to get the story. The film makes you think, but it never goes overboard with its complexity. The characters of the film are very interesting and believable. I found myself stuck as to who I was rooting for throughout the film, which one was actually the good guy, or even if either of them are the good guy. This is obviously the sign of well written characters. These well written characters would be pointless however if the characters weren't well portrayed. Luckily in this case, they are very well portrayed. Everyone in the film is great, can't really fault anyone if I'm honest. I'd say the best out of the bunch was Christian Bale (Borden) though, but Hugh Jackman (Angier) was still very good nevertheless. Even all the supporting actors give above average performances in the film. The film nails a really great tone throughout. It has a consistent atmosphere all the way through, it's dark and mysterious. The film is a period piece, and its sets and costumes really capture the feeling of the time. The striking cinematography is also a big help to that too. The Prestige is another brilliant mind bender from Christopher Nolan. If you're a fan of Nolan I'm sure you'll be pleased with this fantastic film.  "

The main characters are emotions. Sadly the only characters one could potentially care about (The humans) are portrayed as robots or puppets in which the emotions are the puppeteers. The film lags in the middle big time, I just wanted the bad jokes and boring middle to come to an end. The idea that one is at the mercy of their emotions is very misinformed and a terrible message to send to kids. Just so it's clear, I love Pixar films. Rarely am I disappointed. But this is trash!

117198,tt2488496,Aaron O'Neill,france,2,"Predictable, unoriginal and kind of annoying despite not being bored","This is an entertaining film. Sadly it's forgettable, I don't pay to see another New Hope, nor do I pay to see a rehash of the same old themes. I pay to enter into the star wars universe and wonder, be brought into the history, the mythology and see something a little more profound. On this is based my rating of the film. Not whether the effects were good (they were) or whether the soundtrack was good (weirdly I don't remember any music or any noticeable theme). The bits that were annoying: B-B-8, it's a piece of machinery not a person with feelings... Kylo Ren: Whilst the most interesting character I found him to be irritating, Disney teens in movies I suppose. Rey: She progresses through the plot with no obvious character development. Luke: ""speechless"". Though I did enjoy the scene I wished he had interacted with Hans and Leia. Death Star: Not much to say here despite enjoying the joke about another death Star. Solo's last scene: Very clich«∏d and disappointing to see him go without a fight. Always hard to follow up a franchise as big as Star Wars. I've never really been a fan despite enjoying (to a degree) the original episodes. How well is the film made from a technical standpoint? 9/10 I give this film ultimately a 2/10. 2 points because at points I was entertained and I'd feel bad giving it a 0 . But I left the theatre disappointed and with no desire to see a sequel. I literally don't care about these characters. Maybe if they get shown on TV in 15-20 years I'll have a look. Makes me wonder what Mr Lucas would have done. Something more original for sure, but better?? based on the last 3 I'm not sure, but I would have at least had the enjoyment of laughing at Lucas's dialogue. I oddly will miss that.  "
134033,tt2278388,Aaron Poole,united kingdom,9,Vivid and artistically directed,"I've never been one for art films, seeming as I'm an art student this is quite odd. However, The Grand Budapest Hotel caught my attention and changed my opinion on art films for the better. It is understandable and easy to follow, being divided into chapters or 'parts'. It is laid out like a book, pacing the story well. As someone who has a poor attention span this was a great thing! The colours in this film are amazing! I found myself pointing excitedly to my other art student friends the complimentary colours and colour schemes used. As sad as I've made myself sound, it makes a change from the old doom and gloom, post-apocalyptic, unsaturated brown we often see in the cinema now days. There is a lot of humour hidden within what could be a dark plot, so rather contrasted in look when the story is taken into consideration. With plenty of casual swearing and sarcastic comments, it struck a cord with my British sense of humour. I do not particularly have any complaints about the film besides it was rather short. I was left wanting more but only because I was enjoying it so much, almost didn't want it to end. One thing that was a little confusing was the mix of British, French and American accents. However, no fuss, it gave it character. Overall, it is an astonishingly colourful film, full of character and life (or maybe not so in poor Tilda Swinton's case). The artistic direction gave way to beautiful scrapbook like scenes with what seems to be paper cut outs. Each part has a title card that features embroidery from what I remember. Also, it has an old fashion feel to the methods of filming. Editing is intended to look bad with obvious green screen and other 1970s-esque effects, making the film more zany than it already is. Definitely one worth watching!  "

And by comparison, just this week I watched ""Life is Beautiful"" for the first time... Does a very good job of showing the ruin that socialism/communism wreaks on the human soul. The absolute lifelessness of East Germany is laid bare for all to see. And the falsity that is socialism -- the control and management of peoples' lives by bureaucrats -- is revealed to be such a ridiculous system, as bureaucrats are no smarter or competent or honest or ethical or principled or incorruptible as anyone else, if not much less. It is amazing to me that the fall of socialism/communism happened so recently, and films like this tell a very compelling story of socialism/communism's horrendous flaws, but still the concept lives on. Amazing... And it will all be repeated. Right here in the USA. As it is already going that way. The spying, the informing, ""Say something if you see something""... Will we never learn? Are we doomed to repeat the same dreadful mistakes over and over and over? Moving movie. Hopefully also eye-opening, to what is starting to take form right here in America.  "
31240,tt0133093,Aaron Prince,united states,10,"Matrix, a complex and well developed metaphor","The Matrix is probably the most important film made in the last 20 years. There are several reasons for this, the biggest of which has nothing to do with metaphysics and ""what is real?""; a question which is quite literally asked throughout most of this film. The Matrix is a story about Neo, a computer hacker living the double life of Mr. Anderson, a person with a ""job at a respectable software company"" and ""helps his landlady take out her garbage"". Yet as No, the protagonist is looking for something just a tad out of reach and in so doing falls into the Alice in Wonderland world of the Matrix. Neo is portrayed as sort of a savior, a single being whose promise is to win a war against a vastly superior force of super-smart and super powerful machines. And on his way to that level, Neo discovers that the world is nothing like he thought. The Matrix is a movie brilliant on many levels, the most base of which is special effects. Some people are willing to dismiss this as nothing more then a good story, a good action film. But hold on now, I say this movie is deep. This movie has a level of subtlety that not many have caught on to. Here's a question worth asking: why is the dream world of the Matrix set in the 20th century? What purpose did the brothers who made this film have in using this time period ad the period represented in the Matrix? In a very conscious effort on the parts of this movie's creators, the Matrix is, in a sense, a dream world which reflects our current world. This then is the metaphor that the brothers have tried to set up. We are living a dream. Every aspect of our lives is designed to pull wool over our eyes. We understand Neo, because Neo's initial plight is relateable. In a way, this time period was chosen because it was the hight of capitalism. In my opinion, the Matrix is a movie which creates a complex metaphor where humans literally become cogs in a great machine. The literalness of being into a battery must be translated into real life. Like those living in the matrix, we in real life, are serving a system which ruthlessly and unapologetically exploits us. Quite literally, the Matrix is the capitalist machine, dehumanizing and exploiting individual humans. That at least is the message I get from the Matrix: a harsh criticism of the capitalist machine that makes up our ""real life""  "

This movie is probably the best of the group.  It's a brilliant story matched with a brilliant screenplay.

148745,tt0401792,Aaron Pyle,united states,9,Brutal and powerful,"Last night, I saw what could probably be the best comic-to-film adaptation ever made (or anything-to-film adaptation possibly). I say this because it stuck to the source material verbatim. Dialouge was spot-on and the look of the characters along with the compositions of the shots directly followed what was in the original series. I think there were only two scenes cut form the film that probably should have been included for a bit more characterization, but it still remains faithful. True, this movie may still not be for everyone. It is brutal and insane. Those who don't follow film-noir may not understand the claustrophobic atmosphere and the dreariness and people who may not be comic readers may not understand the dark humor and the insane action/seeming lack of physics. Despite this, it is a modern mastic in both storytelling and effects. The story may seem hateful or cynical to some, but I would argue that it is quite the opposite. Each main character willingly walks into situations that he knows will have dire consequences, but chooses to do so anyway due to the kindness of a stranger (Marv), loyalty to friends (Dwight), or simply out of a sense of justice (Hartigan). They make sacrifices when they could simply walk away and are given the chance to do so. As for the effects, the digital green screen provides a fitting backdrop into this world while not taking too much away from the action due to the desire to shove eye-candy down our throats. Some shots seemed a bit awkward, but for the most part, it enhanced the story rather than became a distraction.  "
2203,tt0111161,Aaron Robotham (azawaza),united kingdom,10,For all those who haven't seen it yet (and don't want the story ruined)," This is the best story driven movie ever, and yet until the end it doesn't have any forceful direction in plot, it doesn't need it. All the lead up is a natural story, which is allowed to evolve and expand in a way that is so humanly aware and so subtle that it's remarkable. I remember showing this movie to some friends after I'd seen it and a parent walked in about halfway through and asked ""was it good?"" they all said it was enthralling and amazing, then the parent added ""what's it about?"". There was a pause, because everyone realised that to summarise this movie would undermine what it is about in every way possible: every nuance and intricacy is important, and they deserve every minute of screen time that they are generously awarded. We grow into the characters so well that we aren't surprised by how they behave, because we can understand it. Even the apparently crazy antics of Brooks is wholly comprehensible. Then there's the music, amazingly visual and emotionally abundant in content. The movies so good that it doesn't need music to drive it, but when the music is of such astounding quality you begin to get a real resonance of mood, and an extra dimension of depth in the already amazing aesthetics of the cinematography. Whether everyone else is blown away by this movie doesn't bother me, because I will know how lucky I am. Lucky that I came across this movie, and lucky that I get it... that I really get it, in a way obviously not everyone in the world can. Anyone reading this should just hope they will fall into this category, and anyone who hasn't yet should just watch it again, and again, and again... (Please note, the ending is just as perfect as the rest of the package, but in-case someone hasn't seen it yet, I don't want to give it away).    "

I want to keep this short because others have listed such amazing reviews, but my account called for adding just one, and if I'm going to use my first on any movie, it would be this masterpiece. It's sad that Ledger passed before this movie was released (or at all) because the rumor mill had Joker returning in the epic conclusion of the trilogy.

I was voicing my displeasure with the utter predictability of the show and total lack of any climactic event and being left with a feeling of absolutely nothing happened in that film. My friend replied with the comment, ""That's what the ""middle"" film of a trilogy is. It is simply the glue for the first and third films. Not every trilogy is STAR WARS."" My point exactly. Empire is still light years ahead of itself simply because it is still the only ""middle film"" of a trilogy to keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you taken aback by its own climactic events and revelations. We can all remember the first time we saw the Battle of Hoth and were blown away, also who cannot say their world was sent for a spin when we found out Darth was Luke's father. We all have our own personal moments with STAR WARS. The music still stirs our souls and is prevalent in our society. Ask any Raiders fan if they enjoy the Imperial March. It is a part our culture.

24896,tt1375666,Aaron Shah,united states,6,An Action Film Disguised as an Intellectual film,"Repost of my Amazon.com ""Inception"" review for IMDb: While this film has many great aspects to it: The acting, special effects and a compelling topic; I couldn't help but feel overall disappointed with this film. Despite the abundant action packed sequences, ""Inception"" left me bored. This is most likely due to the fact that the movie is close to nothing but 3 hours of fending off enemies that are nothing but nameless faceless ""white blood cells"" defending the subconscious. It just felt like it dragged on forever. That along with the fact that I felt zero attachment to the characters in the movie and an overly ridged dreamscapes made this film feel horridly sterile. Not to mention, the film felt very jumpy. As in it jumps from scene to scene to scene every few minutes. In fact, the film may have been trying to pull off a feat so grand, that it leaves you thinking its all just a big jumbled mess not worth the frustration of following. I can deal with a complex film, but I feel that the jumping around to all the scenes occurring simultaneously made the film lose focus. In other words, I watched the movie play out, but it did not pull me into it. I was a detached viewer, no emotional involvement whatsoever. On top of that, the film was honestly very predictable and had very little in the revelation department. You could always see the tracks before the train went over them so to speak. One aspect of the movie that just completely dumbfounded me was that the film managed to be both imaginative, yet uncreative at the same time. There is so much potential for creativity in a movie about dreaming, but this film decided to make the dreams seem more like virtual reality then actual dreams. However, the biggest disappointed of this movie is the fact that everyone claimed it was an intelligent thinking mans film. This film has not exercised one bit of critical thinking in my mind. It feels overly superficial and hardly a film that can spark deep philosophical debate. After watching ""Inception"" it did not have me contemplating the big questions in life one bit. When it ended, it ended, and that was that. In the end, ""Inception"" is not an intellectual deep thinking exercise, it is an average action film masquerading as one. Addendum: The fact that this film has reached such a high ranking here on IMDb I think proves my fears about modern society. We are becoming overall less and less capable of creative and critical thought. ""Inception"" leaves absolutely nothing up to the imagination. It is complex, anally neat and almost mathematically in precision. Society these days seems to like everything spoon fed to them. In other words, as long as it doesn't require too much independent thinking and contemplation, it's a candidate for best movie ever. Don't get me wrong, ""Inception"" is a fine action film that is smoothly and methodically executed, but if your like me and require something with deeper meaning, emotional involvement and room to have thoughts of your own, ""Inception"" will leave you disappointed.

99874,tt2096673,Aaron Shindlebower,united states,10,Best animated ORIGINAL movie of the past decade,"Growing up watching Pixar movies, I got used to excellence. Starting with Toy Story, Bugs Life, Monsters Inc... the franchise (if that's what you would call it) seemed to be impervious to failure. I remember, even as a kid, thinking that I could always rely on Pixar to make a good film. But their perfection in film ran dry with Cars 2, and continued the following two years with sub-par flicks Brave and Monsters University. After taking a much needed year off, audiences were treated to Inside Out, a story of 5 emotions, given the task of monitoring and directing a young girl named Riley through the loneliness of leaving her hometown in Minnesota to live in San Francisco. After a brief mishap between the prime emotion of Joy, and the often-looked-over Sadness, the two are whisked away from Riley's ""Head-Quarters"" and off to her long-term memory, where they have to find a way to get back in order to save Riley from her own emotions. Let me first say that I was initially skeptical. For one thing the idea of the story seemed far fetched and strange. Another, and for me more important factor, was the fact that this film is rated PG. I have always been a fan of the way Pixar has been able to make EXTREMELY family friendly movies and still make them relateable for kids and adults. I was afraid that this movie would resort to making potty humor jokes and slight innuendos that go way over kids heads (nod to the Shrek films). This isn't the case though. I don't think the humor is the reason this movie got a higher rating, but rather the very extreme emotional roller coaster this movie turned out to be. I'm a huge fan of kids movies having an underlying moral purpose. This movie doesn't do that. It goes so much further as to put the moral purpose in front of the actual story. It's no question in anyone's mind that the actual point of this story was not for Joy to make it back to Head Quarters, but for Joy to realize that Sadness (or sadness) has a purpose in a person's life, and that it shouldn't be bottled. So many kids movies today teach things like ""being brave"", or ""loving family"". While those are very important, this movie may actually teach adults something... That sadness, while coming from a place of pain, is a means to a greater end, and ultimately joy. This is why I would call this the Best original animated movie of the past ten years!  "

James Cameron has come over and beyond, not just mine, but everyone's expectations and has put together a film that doesn't just focus on action or effects, but focuses on the characters as well. Which is why I like older movies better than newer movies. The thing about older movies is that since back in those days, there was no such thing as CGI, so instead of making the monsters or whatever look real and convincing, they made they characters convincing as well. Now, we could make a movie that is entirely CGI, and the problem with that is, that instead of focusing on the characters, they focus more on making the monster or whatever as real as possible, but they forget about making the characters real. I like this film because it's the on in a million that has good effects, and good characters.  "
18004,tt0137523,aaron steven,united states,10,"A dark, twisted ride through the human brain."," Fight Club is one of the greatest contemporary films ever, directed by one of the great contemporary directors of our time. (David Fincher). Based on the Chuck Palahniuk book of the same title, it is a coming of age story for people who are still coming of age in their thirty's. Our main character, who i will refer to as narrator (Norton), is a man on the edge of sanity. His job carries him all over the world, and because of it he cannot sleep. His airport to hotel lifestyle brings many new friends, including one special one. Tyler Durden (Pitt), is a sick, delinquent free-spirit who is just full of meaningful quotes and useful information. Their relashonship grows, and Tyler's influence over the narrator becomes powerful. Together they start FIGHT CLUB, an underground bare-knuckle boxing arena where blue-collar slaves may come and truly live. Their journey together goes through making soap, grand-scale vandalism, chemical burns, and city blocks reduced to rubble. As the narrator discovers more about himself, he discovers the secret about Tyler. The twist in fight club will send you into whiplash, then make you rethink the entire movie, and its meaning. It is the only movie in my collection that i can watch again and again and every time discover more about the characters, and more about my own life. I have used the movie as a source for many of my college essays, that's how impactful it is. Fight Club will stand the test of time as one of the greatest contemporary films ever.

83480,tt0093058,Aaron Steven,united states,10,The perfect blend of Tragedy and Energy. the perfection of Stanley Kubrick.,"A very disturbing film about the Vietnam War, much darker than any of Kubrick's other films. The Music stands out as a major contributer to the film's mentality. Kubrick likes to use music of the time his films takes place, and it made perfect sense for Full Metal. The film really gets into the minds of the soldiers. What Apocalypse Now was for the Air Cav, this movie is for the Marines in Vietnam. The film's major point is the Duality of Men, and the beauty of Kubrick's shots helps instill a feeling of Victory even though all you see in the film is defeat. This is the most beautifully shot war film I've ever seen, even better than Terry Malick's Thin Red Line. Shots are crisp, perfect, colorful and each scene has its own embrace and feeling, paired wonderfully with the music. All in all, a beautiful war film that delves deep into the psyche of a solider in the Vietnam era. The perfect blend of Tragedy and Energy. the perfection of Stanley Kubrick.  "

It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest. I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be.  "

27856,tt0167261,Aaron Sticht,united states,10,Academy take heed and recognize!," I was absolutely enthralled with the Two Towers, I don't think there are enough superlatives in the English language to express the pleasure and all out thrill I received from watching this movie unfold on the screen. Peter Jackson is absolutely brilliant with his making this movie a separate film with a completely different style of editing from the first installment of the series. I do however wish to make an editorial comment here regarding the Academy of Motion Picture sciences nominating the first film for practically every category imaginable and the film only coming away with a couple of statues. Listen up Oscar, this film is BY FAR the best Picture of the year, and Peter Jackson is a penultimate director and deserves credit for the incredible work that he has done making a movie that is not only pleasing to the fans of the work on which it is based, but also is very well crafted as a GOOD motion picture should be in this day and age. I read last year that there were some people commenting about the film not being that good because it is basically a chase movie. REALLY? I mean get real people, of course it is, and anyone with half a brain who has actually READ the original masterpieces on which the films are based would have KNOWN that! This isn't Rocket science people! Tolkien I think is smiling down on Peter Jackson right now as he has done well for making a visually and artistically stunning movie. For those who have Rank & Bass's interpretation of Hobbits and Dwarves and Gollum, throw everything out from your mind. Gollum most specifically is the most accurate and true form to Tolkiens description of not only his appearance but as to his genetic origins being closely related to Hobbits. It is his characterization by Andy Serkis along with the mystical Ent Treebeard played by John Rhys Davies which in my opinion makes this film as good as one who is a LOTR fan would hope for. Not only that, but the CG technology used to create these two characters is by far some of the best computer animation I have ever seen, and the realism that these characters posses is definitely the best live action characters since Jurassic Park. Brad Dourif's portrayal of Grima Wormtongue was also worthy of note as he is as snaky and evil in the book as he was in the movie. All in all, this is a wonderful fast paced film. The editing was much more snappy than in the Fellowship of the ring. There are many more separate stories going on at the same time due to the Fellowship having parted at the end of the film and there are three separate tracks taking place simultaneously. The only thing I felt was distracting was where I ended up sitting during the film, I was near the front of the theater and during some of the action scenes, due to how close I was to the screen, it was blurry at times and there was more activity going on than I could follow. This was not the filmmakers fault however, I was just too close to the screen to see everything happening at once. I would caution those who would like to bring younger children to this movie as it is definitely more violent and scary than the first film and some parents may find themselves calming nightmares for several days after a younger child sees this movie. Bravo Peter Jackson!  "
143152,tt0198781,Aaron Sticht,united states,8,Brilliant and unexpected,"Monsters Inc. is without a doubt a well conceived movie. The writing was very good and the storyline, contrary to what one professional reviewer from CNN.com said, does NOT drag in the middle. If anyone has seen the early trailer of this movie, it doesn't give justice at all to the movie. John Goodmans portrayal of the big blue monster Sully is warm, and touching. His interaction with the little girl he names Boo is absolutely delightful. There are actually several scenes where some really heartwarming and tear-jerking things happen. This is very surprising considering Disney hasn't really released a tear-jerker since the Lion King in 1994. Unfortunately Billy Crystals character named Mike while very much in character for him is not nearly as visible in the picture as many movie goers would like. Although he is a main character, his humor is very subdued and he is not as sarcastically funny as he is capable of. Even though John Ratzenbergers (Cliff Clavin from Cheers) role is a small one, his character Yeti is very comical and provides a few moments of comic relief during a particularly tense section of the movie. The animation however is far more brilliant than Disney/Pixar's previous CGI releases Toy Story, A Bugs Life, and Toy Story II. The environments created for the characters is very cartoon-like in many respects, unlike the phenomenal realistic worlds created in this Summers hit Shrek. The animation is not as complex as Shrek was, but it is very obvious just looking at Sullys heavy fur coat to see the advances computer animation has taken since Jurassic Park rewrote the book on computer effects in 1993. All in all this movie is more geared to kids in the content of the dialog. Parents will find the movie enjoyable, but don't expect as much sarcastic wit and sexual innuendos as Shrek contained as this is a Disney movie after all. I recommend seeing this movie, you'll get a real kick out of the animated short film Pixar created for this release that precedes the movie called ""For the Birds"". It didn't hurt to have Lucasfilm release it's first trailer for Star Wars Episode II with this movie either.  "
67703,tt0169547,Aaron Takhar,United Kingdom,9,The best film of the 90's,"From the start of Sam Mendes' film we are aware of the ending. It still comes as a bittersweet surprise. The film opens with a shot of the protagonist's street and eventually into his house. The protagonist is Lester Burnham played by an incredible Kevin Spacey. In these opening shots we see his wife and her co-ordinated garden and footwear and their ""better homes""esque house. From this it sounds like a glorification of the American dream. The truth is the complete opposite as it smashes it. The opening song is entitled ""Dead Already"" from the films' apt soundtrack. Lester's groggy state is changed drastically when he first sees his daughter's ethereal friend Angela. He subsequently becomes infatuated with her. The film is so great because it presents so many different themes which intertwine like the plot of a Tarantino film. The themes represent all the characters as neither heroes nor villains but victims of society and excessive materialism. It is a darkly hilarious satire which clearly has taken inspiration from George Orwell's novel ""1984"" and David Lynch's 1986 film ""Blue Velvet"". The cinematography by the masterful veteran Conrad Hall contains some of the most beautiful (it's thrown in on purpose) use of colour in film. It massively juxtaposes the brilliant yet unnerving reality of Alan Ball's witty and bleak script. Lester goes on a journey to rediscover himself and subsequently leaves his job as an advertising executive and applies for a job in fast food. He begins a strict work-out regime (apart from occasionally smoking drugs). He also buys his childhood dream car. He continues with this adolescent demeanor until he eventually appeals enough to Angela. Now this is where the film could have ended poorly, of course I won't ruin it for you. All that can be said is that the whole film is an exploration into the definition of beauty in our current society which is eventually found by Lester. The characters are treated with delicacy as the story revolves around them all searching for something intangible. The film is so effective as a satire because it neither supports nor condemns any of the characters. It presents them and their lives objectively. In many ways Lester's representation is similar to Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"" (1976). Inasmuch as both films contain a character study not analysis and leave enough ambiguity to morally agree or disagree with both characters. In a nutshell ""American Beauty"" is the best movie of the 90's and the best of Spacey's illustrious career. Need I say more!  "
53372,tt2582802,Aaron Taylor,canada,10,Not just Great Performances but a Great Film.,"Obviously going into this film the hype was high with word of J.K. Simmons and his masterful performance, however I was pleasantly surprised by just about everything pertaining to this film. The performances, dialogue, lighting, cinematography, and over all direction was extremely well executed. There is a specific event in the film which kind of crosses a line into a completely unbelievable circumstance, however it does recover itself. The editing at points felt abrupt and rough, however it doesn't hinder the film too much. Just about every actor is over shadowed by the absolutely masterful performance by J.K. Simmons, one thing to be noticed by the end of the film is the performance of Miles Teller who seemingly solidifies himself as (as clich«∏ as it is to say) one of the best young actors around. This film is certainly worth watching, no matter if you like Jazz or not. Also, I would like to say that I've noticed a few negative reviews regarding the ""intensity"" of some characters and the vulgarness of some of the lines. These people are politically correct douchebags, the type of person who get offended for other people, and who think a film showing assault simply means the creators condone that behavior. If anything, this movie is enjoyable if you've experienced life, persevered, and even after doing everything right you're told it's wrong, that's life and this film nails it. It makes you feel defeated at points, and it makes you feel enthused about something only to get slapped in the face (in a good way).  "

As someone that's not a huge Affleck fan, I felt he really did a good job with this role but Rosamund Pike steals the show with her performance. The Soundtrack is really well done sounding like a mix between Vangelis and Nine Inch Nails at points. I believe films should be advertised purely by who directs it, as a David Fincher fan this film is truly damn near perfect from the subtle perversion within editing, the innovative soundtrack and especially great social commentary. I honestly feel this film will receive negative reviews purely for the issues it looks, essentially the opposite effect of a movie like ""The Butler.""  "
41837,tt0120586,Aaron Thies,united states,10,Excellent Movie," Why do people only believe traumatic events push you towards the dark side in movies, but when a movie portrays a traumatic event pushing the character in a good way they refuse to believe it. Edward Norton's character has plenty of time to think in prison, and this takes three years - that is not quick at all. Prison gives you nothing but time to think. Of course we are not going to see every nuance of his change of mind over those three years, just the key moments. If you want to talk about a movie where a character makes a total chance towards race in a very short amount of time see Monster's Ball. Other review say Edward Norton's character transforms to a lover of all races. I do not see this at all. He becomes tolerant, at least to the point of being quiet. I believe silent hatred is the first step towards racial unity. This is flat out an excellent movie.  "

I have been an avid film-watcher for 20 years now and rarely have I ever been so inspired and filled with life after watching a film. Everything about this movie worked for me, which is incredible given what they accomplished in a little over two hours. Most of my favorite films have several important themes mixed with an interesting plot and genuinely funny, dramatic and poignant moments. It's so refreshing to see a film not afraid to take chances and deal with issues that are so relevant to the world today. This film should be a screaming alarm to everyone who has become complacent in ANY government that cares nothing of the majority of their citizens. Sadly, however, many may need more than what happened to V to finally realize what atrocities can occur when you do not stand up for love and justice. In any case, V for Vendetta is and will always be an unequivocal classic in my eyes, one I will show to my kids someday. Oh, and the music V uses hasn't seen this great a day since Bill Murray blew up the golf course in Caddyshack. GO SEE THIS TWICE!  "

Each of them could be told separately and be just as entertaining, but the way we are pulled back and forth from reality and Ofelia's dream world only enriches the story that much more. The film is two hours long, but it seems to go by much faster since you are always involved in the action. At times this film reminded me of an epic anime of sorts, like something from Hayao Miyazaki, a master of fusing beauty and destruction, love and hate. When I first heard of the level of ""R ratedness"" in this film, I was expecting gratuitous blood slinging, but that just wasn't the case. The gore (which isn't too terrible when compared to many films out there) is appropriate, and only adds to the power of the film. It's gonna be hard for Guillermo del Toro to top this one.  "

The cinematography is bound deeply by its immersion, and ability to create an environment and atmosphere. The score is correctly sparse, when used adding a powerful emotional urgency to the film, when not used, the sound design is penetrates the mind, and makes the film feel alive and beating.

Essentially Mary and Max is a film about detailed troubled people searching for friendship. It takes a refreshing stance on life that I have certainly not seen in other films before. The animation is beautifully characterive, and the soundtrack is stunning. But what I really like about Mary and Max is that it explores the lifelong questions of friendship, loneliness, anxiety and even suicide in a way that is as accessible to young teens as it is ground shaking for adults - it is rare that you find a film that is so honest and good natured..

I am reminded of Roger Ebert's review of Tyrannosaur - ""This isn't the kind of movie that even has hope enough to contain a message. There is no message, only the reality of these wounded personalities."" - apart from that I believe Amores Perros has the narrative complexity and dexterity to hold a message, even if it is only for those willing to create a message themselves. From a technical front, the cinematography and score are enough to carry the heavy dense narrative but not enough to dazzle or excite. The acting is consistently incredible from all members of cast, showing true and powerful dedication to their craft and to the film. The pacing sags in the centre but is quickly lifted for the conclusion. The film feels very long in a Magnolia kind of way, that is, a good way - leaving you utterly engrossed in the narrative with plenty to think about afterwards.  "

The Matrix had a similar plot structure to one of 1998's best movies ""Dark City"" which unlike the Matrix, didn't bog down the action with boring actors and dialogue.

40236,tt0120815,Aaron Widera,united states,9,A Brave look at WWII?," The effect this movie has on you is devastating. The combat scenes in the movie are where you can find Speilberg exploring territory that no other director has before in war movies. Spielberg comes as close to capturing the madness of war by showing us the horror in an unrelenting fashion. Deaths alternate between quick and horrifying and slow and agonizing. It's unfortunate that such a pedestrian script was used to connect the awesome combat scenes. But the frustratingly simplistic plotline serves as a way for the characters to question war in a way a post-Vietnam American would, without making such questioning seem historically preposterous (as it did in ""The Thin Red Line,"" whose ""hero"" has gone AWOL just months following Pearl Harbor). The movie would have been a 10 if not for the bookends (Private Ryan visiting Normandy as an old man) that were taken from ""Titanic.""  "
100951,tt0457430,Aaron Winder,united kingdom,9,Weird but in a good way,IF you think this film is all about happy families and fairy tales then you are mistaken. This film will take you on a joy ride around the weird and mysterious fantasy's of a little girl named Ofelia. The way that the film starts with a non-linear narrative with Ofelia laying on the ground bleeding within the wall of the Labyrinth. This allows the audience to straight away create an emotional connection with this little girl as we already know that the ending is not going to be happy so we are left wondering and when this will happen to Ofelia. To conclude I believe that this film is a excellent as it creates this fantasy whereas many other films simply just use the real world. I see this film as a more adult alternative to Disney films and it is one of the best international films I have ever seen.

It did not quite do it for me and if the last part of the film was not the way it was, I would have considered giving a rating of 6/10. However, it is promising to see that Bryan Singer (director) went on to produce films such as Valkyrie, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men: First Class, which does show he is able to produce films worth watching. What maintained my engagement with the film was the change of scenes from the past to the present and vice versa. Acting was of moderate quality. The film did take a fair bit of time to get going. I feel that without Kevin Spacey, the film lacked depth. A clever ending and brilliant acting by Kevin Spacey are as much as I can say when it comes to pointing out the positives.  "

The way the director used different styles of camera angles and techniques really made the movie what it became. The soundtrack was exquisite. I don't think the director could of chosen a better cast roll for the film, I genuinely felt that every actor/actress was perfect for their role. I do however feel they could of gone into greater detail about how his childhood affected some of the decisions he made in his life because you could defiantly tell that some of what brought him to go to the bush was the way he was raised and the environment he was brought up in.

119208,tt2488496,Aaron1375,united states,8,I enjoyed this entry into the Star Wars universe more than the prequels,"My review is pretty much going to be one of those that are going to be unhelpful for all, I'm afraid. I only write these things so that when I pass on from this mortal world, something of me will remain. With this film though, I did not utterly love it and give it a ten so those that did are going to hate my review while on the other hand I did like the film and did not give it a one, so those that hated it or really disliked it will hate my review. I literally read a review where a person gave this film a one, but there were things he enjoyed about the film. Um, if you give the film the lowest ranking that means there should not be anything in it you enjoyed. There are a whole lot of numbers between 1 and 10 to use! It matters not; the film was good to me as it was better than the prequels. Why? Well for one it had better humor. Another reason? It felt more real while the prequels I felt I was watching people in front of a green screen. I can keep going on, but yeah, this one is better than the prequels; however, that being said, it is not as good as any of the originals either. I was really enjoying the film up until the final act which felt kind of rushed. After a certain character takes a fall, the film just speeds along to its conclusion and I just felt more was needed. The story is a bit of a retread of the first Star Wars film, but I was expecting it to be more so than it was. I felt it had enough new to offer to keep me entertained. Well, like in the first film, a droid is tasked with the final piece of the puzzle as Luke Skywalker has been missing and a new order has arisen to fill the void of the evil Galactic Empire left behind. A young girl and a storm trooper who has had enough will try to get the droid back to the resistance fighters lead by General Leia who is desperately trying to find Luke. They shall get help from Han Solo who has gone back to smuggling and Chewbacca ever loyal Wookie. The new order though has a new weapon that takes the power of the sun to cause devastation and a new evil has appeared in the form of Kylo Ren, a man who wishes to be better than Vadar! It was cool seeing Harrison Ford as Han again and some of the old favorites. Han is about the only one from the original films to make more than basically a cameo appearance though. The new characters are pretty good as Fin the former storm trooper was a bit interesting as was Rey, a mysterious girl who seems to harbor some force powers of her own. My favorite new addition though was Poe as he was very enthusiastic and I am hoping he has a more extended role in the next film. I liked Kylo Ren at first, but he deteriorated kind of badly as the film went along and I am kind of hoping they introduce another Sith lord in the next film, because Ren just did not seem quite competent enough to poise much of a threat without some backup. As I said, the film felt a bit weak during its final act and this character was one of the reasons I felt it weak. As for the new Deathstar, I thought it looked cool and I loved it when that one commanding officer ordered it fired and it took out three planets, but at the same time, one would think they'd stop making them with such obvious weak points! So overall, I thought it was a good film. I am not sure it really warrants all this undue hatred I have seen from various people, nor do I really seeing it being the most awesome film ever. It was a pretty good Star Wars film and to me it felt like a Star Wars film, had they put a bit more effort into the conclusion I would have probably given it a nine, but an eight to me is a good film. A lot of movies this year have gotten eights, as very few movies released lately have really pushed my buttons enough for a higher score with the exception of the latest Mad Max film which is my favorite film I saw in theaters in 2015. This one though capped the year off nicely as I did not see anything that I did not enjoy at the theater this year. If this film had disappointed me like the prequels this would have been the last Star Wars film I was going to see, but I will be seeing the next installment which would be the eighth. Still unsure if I want to watch the Rogue Squadron one.  "
131912,tt1392190,Aaron1375,united states,10,Mad Max returns to theaters after long hiatus in furious fashion!,"After viewing Avengers Age Of Ultron a couple of weeks ago and now this one, I have to give this film the edge as far as enjoyment goes. 'Wow' is just one of the words I would like to use when describing Max's return to the big screen...a return that was long overdue and it was very nice finally seeing a Mad Max film in the theater. The film put forth here is one of intensity and nearly nonstop action, a film that does not have its characters stopping in a random place so that we can see some back story that really is not relevant to the plot, no flashback scenes so the director can tell you why the characters are the way they are...no, here we have simple action and the characters' actions telling you what they are about. It would be nice to see other Mad Max films in the future and it is possible as Tom Hardy did sign on to do three films. More than likely if they did get made, Max would once again find himself in the middle of a dispute that he really wants no part of, but begins to feel the need to help. This film starts out with Max getting captured in record time as he is taken to a place called the Citadel which has water and greenery in abundance, but said greenery is controlled by a man named Immortal Joe. A woman who apparently drives for him, named Furiosa begins her next mission, but she is about to break ranks with Immortal Joe and Max will soon try to help her and her cargo escape the demented mad man and his crew of crazies in an attempt to find a place away from the madness. It was great seeing Mad Max again as Miller made sure a lot of the staples from previous films were included as well as some odes to the previous films. It was nice seeing the sawed off shotgun, the pursuit vehicles and the nitro. Makes me wish they'd let Miller direct one of the many comic book adaptations as he proves you can create a film that is nearly all action without it looking like a cut scene from a video game. Tom Hardy does admiral filling in for Gibson, had they made this film when Miller had originally envisioned Gibson would have been in the lead role once again, but Hardy looked the part and it did feel like he was Max. It was also neat seeing that Miller got the actor who originally played the Toecutter from the first film to be the main villain here, though he is most definitely a different character. So yes, really good action films with very little talking can be enjoyable to watch. Why wouldn't they be? I've never understood at times why they always feel the need to make action movies and such accessible to everyone. It is not as if they add gun fights and car chases to a musical to make it more enjoyable for a male, so why they always seem to do this for people who do not like action films seems a bit silly. Granted, you may lose some of the American audiences money, but a film like this is going to thrive in the foreign market. I at least hope it does, because I would enjoy seeing Mad Max on the big screen again; however, if I do not I will at least be satisfied with seeing this one as it was an incredibly intense action film rarely seen these days.  "
154191,tt1431045,Aaron1375,united states,9,Deadpool arrives on the big screen! Again...,"Most fans would rather forget the character's first film appearance, but it was that appearance that did lead to this film. So while the character did not really get fleshed out all that much at the beginning of X-men Origins: Wolverine nor was he portrayed correctly at the end, the end result is one of the funniest movies I have seen at the theaters in many years. Truth be told though, I am not really big on comedies for the most part. Still, this film was a great spectacle to behold and it is nice seeing Ryan Reynold's film really take off. Not only because I always enjoy seeing him in films, but also because he made a comic book movie the right way, something Hollywood seems to scared to do. He made a comic book film where the character acts like he does in the comic, looks like he does in the comic and it has not been made for the general audience. No, we get Deadpool in all his crazed glory, doing what he does best...killing! When he is not killing, he is constantly breaking the fourth wall as Deadpool knows he is a comic book character and Reynold's portrays the crazed 'hero' with magnificent glee! The story, well that is simple. Deadpool wants to kill someone! Why? Well, through a series of flashbacks we learn of the way the merc with a mouth has become the way he is and a love that is lost to him. To not only fix his deformed face, but to also get revenge he must find a guy named Ajax, who is actually named Francis. Deadpool will get help in the form of the mighty Colossus and his teenage prot«∏g«∏. He also has allies in a man who runs a bar that deals with problems, a cab driver who does not seem to mind getting paid in high fives and a blind roommate who enjoys cocaine. Yes, all the typical things one tends to find in comic book movies...not! Did I mention boobs? Yep, they're in there too! So Deadpool must go find the ones who wronged him and do some slicing and dicing too! I am very happy with the film's success; unfortunately, I do believe that Hollywood will get the wrong idea by the results. They are going to just assume that making every comic book film with a slightly edgy character should contain gratuitous violence and nudity and all that when the real reason the film is doing well is the fact it was made for those of us who enjoy reading comics. Too often they soften up a character and completely change things to suit a wider audience, but this film proves that is not necessary. The characters have been portrayed a certain way and I find it insulting when those of us who read comics get dismissed and things added to other comic book films to attract say more female viewers. Seriously, did having Bruce Banner and the Black Widow have a thing really work? Never happened in the comics and this is just one example in one of the more recent comic book movies. Just look at Colossus in this movie. He finally has a Russian accent and he has a better fight scene here than he did in any of the X-men movies. This movie proves you can do things by the book and the film will do good, but the lesson they will learn is just to make everything R. So, I enjoyed this film immensely. Had it opened last year it would have trailed only Mad Max: Fury Road as my favorite film of 2015. My only problems with the film are the fact I thought they showed a bit too much back story in how he became who he was as the film did have a bit of a romantic subplot going itself. Still, in the end it was about shooting and killing and learning that if you are going to be killing and bleeding a lot to make your costume red. This film took awhile to finally get off the ground and I am glad Ryan Reynolds did not give up as he made a very funny comic book film on a rather small budget by today's standards.  "
155995,tt2015381,Aaron1375,united states,10,Guardians of the Galaxy was a blast and my favorite movie of the year so far,"Earlier this year I saw the Captain America sequel and remarked that so far it was my favorite of the films released since The Avengers. However, I also remarked that Guardians of the Galaxy was coming out and it looked like it might be pretty good so it had a chance to be the best. Turns out, it is the best so far! I saw it a week after its release, usually I would have written a review by now, but been busy with a new house and all and I have limited access to the internet. Suffice to say, the numbers are pretty much making me think that others think this is the best one too as the only one that it probably will not outdo is the third installment of Iron Man as far as box office. This movie features a team of offbeat heroes that come together to utilize each others strengths and hide the weaknesses and is a very funny movie with good action as well. It has everything one looks for in a comic movie and I do believe one of the reasons it is a bit better is the fact we are all a bit less familiar with these particular heroes than say those on the X-men or say the Avengers. The story has a young boy visiting his mother one last time in the hospital. The woman dies and the boy runs out of the hospital and cries in the middle of a field where he is abducted by aliens. Years later this young boy is now a young man who calls himself Star Lord. He is after a strange artifact on a planet that appears in ruins. He is confronted and then escapes others after the strange artifact. Star Lord soon finds a bounty on him as the aliens who abducted him and are basically space pirates called Grievers want the artifact as well. Also, after this artifact is one of the most powerful villains in the galaxy, Thanos and he sends his daughter after it as well. Well Star Lord soon finds Thanos' daughter and a raccoon named Rocky and his partner, a tree alien named Groot are after them and after a scramble to get the artifact and get away, they all find themselves locked up in a prison where they meet another alien named Drax, that wishes Thanos' daughter dead. However, they soon will learn to work together and learn what the precious artifact is and how deadly it potentially is in the hands of someone dastardly or anyone for that matter! The film is really good, as I've said, and I believe it has to do with the characters. They are all very unique and they all have their quirks. From the womanizing Star Lord, the can't get a metaphor Drax, to the daughter of the evil Thanos, to the mechanical Rocky with a wicked sense of humor to Groot who can only say, ""I am Groot"", this group is very humorous to watch. I do believe it helps that not many people are familiar with this team, as all the members got to shine. Unlike say a film like X-men where there are so many casual fans so a character like Wolverine is always seemingly showcased and the team leader Cyclops gets portrayed as a wimp when anyone who reads the comics can attest he once fought all the X-men, including Wolverine to a standstill. That is the problem with having so many cartoons, people with limited knowledge draw conclusions and the movie studios cater to them. Like Spider-man. Anyone who has read the comics knows the villains that have been his biggest tormentors are Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus. Venom is all the casual fan wants to see, even though he was only a big time villain for like a five year stretch. Here, though, no one stands out as there is no Wolverine or to a lesser degree Iron Man and I think that is what helped this movie. People thought the fact this was a lesser known comic would hurt, but in actuality it may have helped it. So, this film is my favorite of the Marvel films released since The Avengers. In fact, it is almost on par with that film. I only give that one an edge because I do so love seeing the Hulk do his thing. Though I have heard rumors that the next Guardians film may do the planet Hulk storyline, which would be awesome. This film itself was awesome as it did have a lot of funny characters and good action. Also, Thanos looks great as it almost seems they took him straight off the pages of the comics. My only complaint about the film, which it is only a minor quibble, is that they never showed Thanos really do all that much. I would like to see him do something truly destructive so that the moviegoers not familiar with his power know what is in store when he is the primary villain in a Marvel movie. I was hoping he would be in Avengers 2, but they went with Ultron instead. Hopefully, we shall see him in the third, or heck let him take a more active role in the second film of this franchise, because I like where they are going with it!  "
59987,tt0057012,aaron611,united states,10,Brilliant! A must see film!," Okay, I have to admit: Dr. Strangelove has always been one of my all time favorites. And whether you like Kubrick or not, you have to respect the fact that the man was fearless in the director's chair. I'll never know how Kubrick had the nerve to make a black comedy about nuclear annihilation while the Cold War was at its zenith, but I'm glad he did it. Dr. Strangelove is an absolute joy to watch if you are the type of person who appreciates films that take chances and dabble in the bizarre. The performances by Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden are as good as you will see. The cinematography and the subtle (and not so subtle) traits of the main characters are what drives this movie in my opinion. I could go on but I'll leave it at this: Dr. Strangelove is easily a 10.   "
103959,tt0120735,aaron611,united states,10,Trainspotting/Tarantino hybrid," Frankly, I don't understand all the complaints about the accents in this film. As an American, I had to really listen close to catch certain segments of the dialogue, but that was part of the charm of the characters. It may help to view the Cockney Rhyming Glossary on the DVD beforehand to get the gist of the slang ahead of time. This film has a bit of Tarantino in it but it isn't nearly as serious as Reservoir Dogs. Although bloody, it isn't particularly gory. It maintains a whimsical perspective throughout its length as the various parallel subplots throughout the film suddenly clash together in a satisfying climax. The characters are all quite entertaining as they seem to maintain a perfect balance of realism and cartoon-like qualities. Overall, an entertaining film, funny script, and a well-conceived story.

111348,tt0118715,aaron611,united states,10,"If you like it, you'll love it..."," This movie has no point, no structure, it doesn't appeal to a mainstream audience, it isn't cerebral, and it meanders its way to no real conclusion. Having said that, it is a nearly perfect comedy. When I first saw The Big Lebowski a few years back, I was somewhat disappointed with it. But this movie just gets better with each viewing and it is now easily one of my favorites. The dialogue is just hilarious (despite some excessive profanity) and the interaction of the main characters is thoroughly entertaining. Good acting all the way around although Goodman and Bridges stand out. In general, this is just a ""fun"" movie to watch.   "
72887,tt0082096,aaron611,united states,10,An absolutely brilliant film," Das Boot is a truly refreshing war film in that it does not use special effects as a crutch. Seemingly, the majority of modern films utilize phenomenal special effects to ""entertain"" (or possibly ""insult"") the viewer in an effort to hide a weak script. Das Boot is an exception. The exterior shots are held to a minimum, thus giving you a sense of actually being on board with the crew. You see what they see. You feel what they feel. You truly get a sense for what it must have been like to live in such close quarters while enduring the monotony, terror, and conflicted emotions that were common among U-boat crews. At 3 1/2 hours (the Director's Cut), this film isn't for everyone. But if you are a dedicated film fanatic, this is a must see. I had no problem with the length since every scene had a purpose in developing the characters and building the story. The acting and directing are superb and the newly remastered sound on the Director's Cut DVD is fantastic (remember: in a submarine, sound is everything). Be sure to switch the DVD to the original German language with English subtitles. The English dubbing didn't look too bad but it would ruin the authenticity of the film, in my opinion.     "
108898,tt0434409,aaronac,united states,9,Trivia fact,"I loved the movie, and it has moved into my top 10 favorites, including, coincidentally, the 2002 version of The Count of Monte Cristo. By the way, the version that's featured in V is the 1934 version. It is not out on DVD, and it's nigh-impossible to find on VHS. V is like an opera...the characters are all very thematic, including the ""grounded"" characters. // I feel (and this is likely obvious) that the directors wanted to focus on the dangers of the conservative movements in both the U.S. and the U.K., and are pointing out some potential problems with a continued war in the middle east. I feel that there is just as much danger in liberal government as there is in conservative government, as governmental power is dangerous. It bothers me that they had to pick a side in this argument, instead of just going with the 'absolute power corrupts absolutely' approach. In short, this is still a fine movie.  "
94381,tt0372784,aaronb955,united states,8,THE best superhero movie ever made !! Its almost perfect.,"Few movies ever meet the expectations you may have about them given their premise and the talents of the people associated with them. And there are only a handful of movies that exceed your expectations. Batman Begins is one of those movies that will far exceed your expectations and give you even more. Right from the opening sequence when the young Bruce Wayne encounters the bats for the first time until the final showdown in downtown Gotham I was completely blown away by what I saw on the screen. This is the story about the dangerous and painful journey that Bruce Wayne takes to become Batman and it is as dark and haunting as a Batman movie should be. The story starts off with Bruce(Christian Bale) living the life of a petty criminal in a far east Asian country (looks like Mongolia but is not mentioned). It is explained that he is doing that to study and experience the mind of a criminal in a land where no one knows him as the heir to Wayne enterprises. Here he meets Ducard(Liam Neeson) who recognizes him and after hearing his story decides to train him in the martial arts. The training sequences are fascinating to watch and are given ample time by the director unlike other movies where such scenes are just summarized into fade-in / fade-out shots with background music. It reminded me of Uma Thurman's training sequence in Kill Bill. Its amazing how paying attention to such simple details make or break a movie. There is a cameo by Ken Watanabe (Last Samurai) as the chief of the Shadow Ninja warriors with whom Bruce trains. Next stop Gotham. The shots of Gotham city are unlike what you have ever seen before. No crazy neon lights or huge statues or crazy looking towers as in the previous Batman versions. This is a Gotham of the real world. There are skyscrapers and there are the slums. The bird's eye-view shots of the city are unbelievable from a cinematographic POV but very believable from a realistic POV (since most of it is CGI). The next stage in his journey (after the training) is logistics and equipment. Wayne enterprises' in-house scientist Lucius Fox (Freeman) introduces Bruce Wayne to the Bat-Suit , the Bat-Cape and of course the Bat-Mobile !! And what a machine that is. A real military armored vehicle that looks like a cross between a tank and a sports car. Watching this thing move is worth the price of the ticket (Does it come in black ???). Of course Batman needs a girlfriend and there is Katie Holmes who looks very cute. Many people have pointed out that she is too young and nice to play a District Attorney. (Well would you prefer Amanda Peet who always plays a hard-ass beeyatch ?) Katie does a great job in her role as a DA who's fighting to get the Mafia thugs behind bars. I mentioned in my heading that the movie is almost perfect. It could have been perfect if not for a miscast. The mafia boss is played by Tom Wilkinson who tries to put on a fake American-Italian accent and doesn't even look like one. Even Joe Pesci could have done a better job. Not that Wilkinson's a bad actor ,its just that you don't get a Brit to play Tony Soprano.Anyway, aside from that the movie is perfect. All that was what I saw on the screen. But one of the best things in this movie was the background score. Never has the music been so integrated into the movie as you hear here. It is haunting , grand and moving all at the same time. It complements the main character wonderfully. Bruce Wayne is very tortured in his mind and his struggle with himself is very moving. And Batman is a very haunting , frightening figure (not the nice guy portrayed by Clooney and others). The cinematography is excellent (note the shots of the mountains in Mongolia). One of the most astonishing shots in the movie is when Bruce Wayne goes into the cave and turns on the flashlight waking up the thousands of bats that completely engulf him and the cave. Almost as fantastic as the Sentinals attack in Matrix Revolutions. The acting is top notch (Bale, it seems was born to play Batman) and the direction is just what you hope from some of the great directors , and Nolan has proved himself to be one. The audience in the theater clapped at the end of the movie which proved that this is not just for the die-hard Batman fans. If you decide to see just one movie this summer or even this year , skip StarWars 3 , skip War of the Worlds, GO SEE BATMAN BEGINS.  "
17899,tt0137523,aaronbrody-1,united states,10,"A smart, surreal genre defying masterpiece that packs a big punch","Fight Club is without a doubt, one of my favorite motion pictures of all time. Every time I watch it, I fall more in love with it, and its broken, lonely characters so numb they embrace self destruction as an alternative to our busy, consumer driven world. However, despite the abundance of ""don't conform"" rants spouted by Brad Pitt's character, I don't think this movie has any kind of concrete philosophical or intellectual agenda. In the end, I think its just a strange, darkly humorous story of a psychologically unbalanced man (Jack, played with wry, boyish enthusiasm by Edward Norton) with an underdeveloped sense of self trying to find out who he is (versus what society expects of him), and in doing so, inadvertently starting a cult to create a new world order according to the dictates of his raging, repressed subconscious (which takes the form of a separate identity altogether, Tyler, marvelously played by Brad Pitt in ""Twelve Monkeys"" mode again). The acting is top notch (the hauntingly lovely Helena Bonham Carter is a particular favorite as the chain smoking Marla), as is the cinematography (often imitated since the movie's release, never equaled), and the unconventional film score by the Dust Brothers. A critic once remarked during the initial release of ""Pulp Fiction"" that going to see it was like ""falling down a rabbit hole into another world"" ala Alice. The same can definitely be said of ""Fight Club"", based on the cult novel by Chuck Palahniuk (a man who's work I adore, and yet am almost completely at odds with when it comes to analyzing and interpreting said body of work). I recommend that newbies read the book first, because although screenwriter Jim Uhls made the story easier to digest in adapting it for director David Fincher (including beefing up the romance angle between Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter's characters, and generally making a mostly unpleasant narrative a bit more tolerable), casual viewers will almost certainly miss the meaning behind casual throwaway lines like ""even the Mona Lisa's falling apart."" Again, its one of my favorites, and along with ""Halloween"", ""Batman Returns"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master"" among others, is a movie that, for one reason or another, is permanently stamped into my unconscious. Contrary to what Chuck Palahniuk states on the DVD commentary (although Palahniuk deserves lots of love), I DO think the end is a happy one. Yes, there are still plenty of space monkeys still on the loose, but Jack has finally found himself, and a little romance in the bargain with the long suffering Marla. The Pixies' late eighties composition ""Where is My Mind?"" makes the perfect closing theme (and is a song I like blast on my radio on the way to work, or coming home from work from time to time).

The movie is witty, and incredibly intelligent critique of the continued dehumanization of society, spurred on by big wheel corporations that break down people into nothing more than simple demographics and age and race groups. This message is the heart of the film, which has even more meaning today, and remains vital, even as some of the movie's more topical targets of mockery (specifically Angela Davis, Patty Hearst, and the Symbionese Liberation Army) have faded into total obscurity for most of the younger generation. Occasionally this piece DOES become a bit long-winded, and most of the movie consists of wordy and incredibly literate diatribes (you won't find dialouge like this in a modern movie, dumbed down multiplex masses of today wouldn't know what the hell was going on and would immediately start talking on their cell phones or sneak into another film with their pack altogether). The character of the ""Mad Prophet of the Airwaves"" Howard Beale himself is transparently Chayefsky himself yelling through a bullhorn at the audience. Unlike most movies, the plot seems to move along less by action, than by dialouge; this is an opera without music. and one full of beautiful, spoken arias at that. The strength of the dialouge ultimately won me over, although this more classically theatrical style is a bit jarring at first, and the characters have the tendency to lapse into shrieking hysteria, which may be off-putting to viewers (almost all of characters in this movie have a meltdown in this movie. Beatrice Straight won an Oscar for hers, in one of the shortest screentimes ever to garner the ""Best Supporting Actress"" award). Think of it as Tennesse Williams for Fox News Devotees. Some of the best lines however, as decidedly less poetic. When an executive asks Faye Dunnaway's character where it puts them, after the company's CEO declines their petition to axe the Mad Prophet's suddenly unprofitable show, she replies simply:""it puts us in the shithouse."" Although some of the humor is very broad (Faye Dunnaway having an orgasm while discussing ratings point), most of the slings and arrows of Chayefsky's patented rage find their mark. All of the rich, bitter humor of this movie culminates in a perfectly outrageous punchline that knocks this movie into ""Twilight Zone"" territory (which at its height, was itself a pulpit for Rod Serling to deliver his own grim, socially conscious, and unwaveringly pessimistic sermons to television viewers), indeed, it wittily concludes that television studios are very much the equal of ruthless mafia families (Robert Duvall, who was in ""The Godfather"", would know).

Story continues the saga of the Corleone family, which sees the return of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, and John Cazale. Robert De Nero joins the cast as a young Vito Corleone, who is forced to leave his native Sicily as a boy, then arrives in New York city, where he grows to be an ambitious man who challenges a local corrupt gangster, takes him out in memorable fashion, then sets up the beginning of his empire. Film contrasts that with the ambitions of his son Michael, who is building his father's business in ways he never would have imagined, but in ways that will come at a very high cost indeed...  Just as engrossing as the first, with a brilliant script and performances. A timeless classic that won Academy Awards for Best Picture(like Part I), supporting actor De Nero, but also for director Coppola himself(overdue!) "
8500,tt0468569,AaronCapenBanner,united states,10,Legendary Sequel.,"Outstanding continuation of ""Batman Begins"" is even better, a complex morality tale perfectly encompassing our troubled times, as Batman finds himself pursuing the mysterious, ruthless, and likely insane genius the Joker, played unforgettably by the late Heath Ledger, who deservedly won a posthumous Academy Award for his inspired performance; every bit as good as Jack Nicholson's was, except far more sinister. His signature line ""Why so serious?"" is double-edged, as this criminal thinks nothing of murder, terror, and destruction; what's more serious than that? Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman is again superb, as is Aaron Eckhart as D.A. Harvey Dent, who tragically becomes Two-Face, as Batman desperately tries to redeem him in time, rather than letting the Joker win another victory; an interesting subplot, seeing how he rejects the Joker's assertion that they are destined to battle forever...not the case here! Haunting ending caps off this masterpiece of fantastic action and profound philosophy, as one man is determined to make a positive difference, even if it means he will be hunted as a result. "
10685,tt0050083,AaronCapenBanner,united states,7,One Courtroom.,"12 Jurors(played by Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Henry Fonda, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Vaskovec, and Robert Webber) all deliberate after a trial involving a young man charged with murdering his elderly father. Initially, 11 of the 12 find him guilty, but the one holdout(Fonda) makes his case for further deliberation, and gradually persuades the other men to his side. But the question still remains: Was the defendant innocent or guilty? Though undeniably well directed and acted, with an engrossing narrative, the one flaw is the Fonda juror, who is just insufferably sanctimonious! His argument of ""It's Possible."" to argue reasonable doubt is absurd, since if taken to its logical conclusion, would never lead to a conviction, since ""it's possible"" that it was the evil twin, or ""it's possible"" that it was paranormal in some way! It's more a study of how one strong-willed man can persuade weaker-willed men to his way of thinking, which does not inherently mean a morally just outcome! Still, a compelling film that does provoke much thought and argument, and can't be so easily dismissed, though it is overpraised. "
11144,tt0108052,AaronCapenBanner,united states,10,Shattering Film Masterpiece.,"Steven Spielberg won a well-deserved Academy Award(as did the film itself) for directing this emotionally shattering, dramatically devastating film about opportunistic businessman Oskar Schindler(Liam Neeson in a superb performance) who goes into business with the Nazis, and Amon Goeth(Ralph Fiennes, unforgettable performance) the death camp commandant who supplies him with imprisoned Jews for his factories. Ben Kingsly plays Itzhak Stern, his secretary who helps Schindler have a moral awakening to the evils of the Nazis, and who later spends his fortune aiding them, eventually shielding them from extermination, saving over 1100 lives. Masterpiece is among the finest films ever made, so deeply moving and wrenchingly does it portray the death camps and what the Jewish people had to endure(aided by the exquisite John Williams score), and Amon Goeth personified evil as he indifferently shot the prisoners, or abused his maid. The ending to the film when Schindler breaks down, and the Jews are liberated is powerful enough for several films, but the Coda at the end is so surprising, yet so fitting, that it remains the most emotionally moving ending ever. A stunning achievement for all concerned, especially Mr. Spielberg.  "
16448,tt0060196,AaronCapenBanner,united states,10,Greatest Film Ever Made.,"Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious wandering gunfighter & bounty hunter ""The Man With No Name"" (AKA ""The Good""), along with Lee Van Cleef as evil gunfighter & bounty hunter ""Angel Eyes"" (AKA ""The Bad"") & finally Eli Wallach as bandit and lowlife ""Tuco"" (AKA ""The Ugly"") in Sergio Leone's brilliantly directed, unbelievably stylish, compelling, & mesmerizing finale to his ""Dollars"" trilogy, with an unforgettable, influential score by Mr. Morricone. Story has the three men looking for buried confederate gold in a cemetery, and the long, winding path it takes to get there. Though long, it is never overlong, being an amazingly involving story of three ruthless yet disparate men. Performances are perfect, script filled with funny & memorable lines, and climax in the cemetery, both the 'Ecstasy Of Gold' & ' Final Showdown' the perfect cinematic experience, so memorably does it combine character, story, direction, and score. My favorite film of all time, which stands up to repeated viewings. (I lost count!)  "
17777,tt0137523,AaronCapenBanner,united states,5,Tyler Durden & Marla Singer,"David Fincher directed this strikingly provocative and original film that stars Edward Norton as ""The Narrator"" of his own life, a frustrated, beaten-down office worker who chances to meet confident and care-free Tyler Durden(played by Brad Pitt). They become friends and business partners(a soap-making enterprise) then create an underground movement called ""Fight Club"", where men fight each other to let off steam and feel ""alive"". He also meets the beautiful and mysterious Marla(played by Helena Bonham Carter) who attends multiple support group meetings like he does, and begins a relationship with both him and Tyler, and as events grow increasingly violent and bizarre, it becomes clear that Tyler and he are closer than viewer at first realized... Audacious film needs to be seen multiple times to fully comprehend it, though some elements(particularly the ending) are so off-putting some may not bother trying. Superb acting all around, and most funny at times, but wallows in nihilism far too much.  "
22704,tt0080684,AaronCapenBanner,united states,9,Best Of The Series,"Episode V is the finest entry of the first two trilogies, since it is the best written(really strong dialogue, situations, and realistic evolution of the returning characters) phenomenal direction by Irvin Kirshner(exciting and breathless, always something going on of interest) and equally spectacular F/X, which still hold up(did not need much tweaking for the Special Editions) Story has the Empire striking back(of course!) against the rebellion(despite the loss of the Death Star) and our heroes' attempts to survive and enact their next plan of attack, only to become captured by an unwitting betrayal of old friend Lando(Billy Dee Williams, quite smooth but appealing). Climactic battle between Luke and Darth Vader is legendary, and breathtaking. Cliffhanger ending sets up the next chapter nicely. A classic.  "
23567,tt0109830,AaronCapenBanner,united states,9,Uplifting & Wondrous Fable.,"Tom Hanks plays Forrest Gump in Robert Zemekis's Academy Award winning(Best picture, director, & actor) fable about a simple and honest man who finds himself floating through life like(the ever-present) feather in the wind. He is often bullied growing up, but finds solace in his best friend Jenny, whom he comes to love dearly as they get older. She tells him to ""run Forrest, run"" and he does, and one day runs into a football game, inspiring the coach to put him on the team, which makes him more popular, though at graduation he joins the military, where he fits right in, much to the bewilderment of his superior officer, Lt. Dan(played by Gary Sinise) whose life he saves, giving him a medal and inspiring him to be a Ping-Pong champion, where he meets three different U.S. Presidents, and later becomes a multi-millionaire by investing in ""a fruit company"" that takes off in a big way. He loves his mother(played by Sally Field) and takes her departure quite hard, running a marathon across the country for years, until he meets up with the elusive Jenny once again... Epic-scale character study is supremely well crafted and acted, remaining a funny, moving, and inspired drama about how one good man can affect the world around him, and still not know it, and remain uncorrupted by it. A truly marvelous achievement by all.  "
24866,tt1375666,AaronCapenBanner,united states,7,Dreams Within Dreams,"Christopher Nolan directed this complex and intelligent film that stars Leonardo Dicaprio as Dom Cobb, an extraction specialist(he can enter the dreams of people and steal their secrets) who is called upon to do a special job; instead of extracting, he'll be implanting an idea, but Cobb's own personal guilt may trap he and his team in a dream-like limbo unless he can tell the difference between a ""dream"" and ""reality"", which is made difficult by there being multiple dreams going on at once... Fine cast, script, and direction, though does give the impression of being too convoluted and ""layered"" for its own good. Still, this is well worth seeing regardless, and remind viewer of earlier Nolan films like ""Following"" and ""Memento"", not to mention the 1984 film ""Dreamscape"".  "
28867,tt0073486,AaronCapenBanner,united states,9,"Powerful Drama Dealing With ""Insanity"".","Based on Ken Kesey's novel about R.P. McMurphy,(unforgettably played by Jack Nicholson, who won an academy award) a rebellious prisoner who fakes insanity in order to avoid a work detail in prison, and is transferred to a mental asylum. He doesn't fool controlling and cold hearted head nurse Ratched(Louise Fletcher, another Academy Award winner). At first McMurphy finds the other inmates funny when they have their group therapy sessions, but after awhile, he comes to care, and even assumes a leadership role, as he inspires them to rebel as well, especially with painfully shy Billy Bibbit(Brad Dourif) who eventually loses his stutter in a key sequence near the end, only to have Ratched cruelly put him down, leading to an extreme turn of events... Whole cast is excellent, script is highly intelligent, both uproariously funny yet also dramatically hard-hitting, with inspired direction by Milos Forman. Ending is both tragic yet triumphant, and may haunt the viewer for years to come. Will Sampson as the silent Indian almost steals the film from Jack & Louise...  "
29947,tt0133093,AaronCapenBanner,united states,9,Neo Begins,"The Wachowski brothers directed this innovate blockbuster hit that stars Keanu Reeves as Mr. Anderson, who is an ordinary computer programmer suddenly thrust into a new reality(which he had always suspected) when government agents led by Mr. Smith(played by Hugo Weaving) target him for interrogation after he is contacted by computer hacker Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) about his true destiny as ""The One"", renamed Neo, who will lead the enslaved humans to rebel against their machine masters who have created a false world in order to fool and control humans. Only by escaping this state can Neo begin this fight... Exciting and thought-provoking film filled with fantastic action scenes and memorable characters. Fine acting too; co-stars Carrie Ann-Moss as Trinity, and has a thrilling ending, though two sequels would follow.  "
33003,tt0076759,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,Influential and Spectacular,"This first ""Star Wars"" film(though later sub-titled 'Episode IV') was a groundbreaking, box office shattering breath of fresh air to the cinemas, and science fiction in particular, which had gotten bogged down in bleak Dystopian futures. Nothing wrong with that in some cases, but moviegoers craved more, and got it with this extremely exciting tale of youth rebellion against an evil galactic empire led by Darth Vader(I though he was a robot at first viewing as a youngster!) a memorable creation, whose entrances were punctuated by the grand music of John Williams, who created an unforgettable score here that kids imitated endlessly! Fine cast includes Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Peter Cushing and Sir Alec Guiness. Climax is truly exciting, though film has a few lulls at times, this is still great fun.  "
35132,tt0114369,AaronCapenBanner,united states,7,Deadly Sins,"David Fincher directed this dark mystery that stars Brad Pitt as detective Mills, who joins more experienced detective Somerset(played by Morgan Freeman) in their murder investigation that seems quite bizarre, as the victims were killed via the judgment of the seven deadly sins(gluttony, sloth, etc.) The killer is quite clever and patient, though the detectives do eventually track him down, and after his arrest, learn that he has one more victim in mind to complete his master-plan, and that it involves Mills' wife(played by Gwyneth Paltrow)... Impressively directed and acted film is supremely well-crafted, with a knockout of an ending you won't see coming, though it is so unrelentingly bleak & depressing that it can be a chore to sit through, yet it remains worthwhile viewing in spite of this.  "
35789,tt0102926,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,Superb Acting In This One!,"Based on the Thomas Harris novel, film follows the efforts of FBI cadet Clarice Starling(Jodie Foster, in an Academy Award winning performance) to catch a serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, who kidnaps and murders his victims. She contacts incarcerated(and legendary) serial killer Hannibal Lecter(Anthony Hopkins, in an unforgettable, brilliant Academy Award winning performance) who taunts Clarice, yet finds himself impressed by her determination and mysterious background, which he intends to take full advantage of, leading to a dramatic(and lethal) escape... Supremely well acted and well crafted horror tale is quite suspenseful and compelling as well, though is a bit over the top at times, this is still excellent. Also won Academy Awards for Best Picture and director(Jonathan Demme).  "
36285,tt0038650,AaronCapenBanner,united states,10,The Film Is Wonderful At Least!,"Frank Capra's perennial holiday favorite stars Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey, a good man who has lived for others his whole life who has a crisis occur on Christmas Eve when Uncle Billy(played by Thomas Mitchell) misplaces the $8.000 he was supposed to deposit in the bank, which could destroy his Savings & Loan company(especially with the bank examiner visiting) Despondent,George considers suicide, but is rescued by his guardian angel Clarence(played by Henry Travers) who proceeds to show George what his hometown of Bedford Falls would be if he had never been born. Having been briefed about George before his arrival, Clarence reveals that hated tycoon Mr. Potter(played by Lionel Barrymore) would rule the town, which is now a sin-filled haven of uncaring people. Even worse, his beloved Mary(played by Donna Reed) would end up an old maid, and of course the children he loves wouldn't exist either... Life is not always wonderful, it's true, but only a real-life Mr. Potter could hate this joyous film, filled with uproarious comedy and poignant drama, showing how one ordinary man can make a huge and positive difference. Unforgettable characters and a genuinely heartfelt ending that will move you to tears make this an all-time classic to be enjoyed any time of the year.  "
36703,tt0114814,AaronCapenBanner,united states,7,Twist-Laden Story.,"Bryan Singer directed this twist-laden story about Verbal Kint, a suspect(Kevin Spacy, excellent) found at a massive boat explosion being interrogated by a detective(Chazz Palminteri) about his involvement. He claims to be innocent, and the real mastermind named Keyser Soze was behind it, a man he is deathly afraid of. He then tells the story of how this began, when he was in the police lockup with other con men(played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollock, Stephen Baldwin, and Benicio Del Toro) who become involved in a revenge scheme that goes wrong... Quite original and unpredictable film is well acted and written, leading to a supremely well crafted finale...only negative is that, when all is said and done, you're not quite sure what to believe, and there is hardly anyone to care about. Still, an engrossing film noir experience.  "
39749,tt0120815,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,Powerful War Story.,"Steven Spielberg once again won a best directing Academy Award for this powerful film(based on fact) that opens with the D-Day invasion on Normandy France, and the battle to secure the beaches as the first step toward liberating France. The battle itself is the most realistic portrayal of actual battle conditions ever put to film, so authentic is the chaos, violence, and impact bullets and explosions would really have on limbs and bodies(no sugar-coating or censoring here!) that it is both fascinating yet disturbing as well. Tom Hanks plays Capt. Miller, who is in charge of the platoon, and once the beaches are secured, he is ordered to locate and return home a Private Ryan(Matt Damon) because he has just lost three brothers in battle, and the Army doesn't want the bad publicity of a grieving mother mourning all four sons. Though he and his platoon are astonished by the order, they obey it, and the rest of the film is their journey to find Ryan, and still fight the war. The first section of the film on the beaches is so powerful and realistic, that the search for Ryan almost feels anti-climatic, yet this film still works because of the realism and superb storytelling involved, though the prologue and epilogue lack the dramatic fireworks they were aiming for, they are still moving enough.  "
41510,tt0064116,AaronCapenBanner,united states,6,Good But Overpraised.,"Sergio Leone's follow up to his superlative ""Man With No Name"" trilogy is highly acclaimed in some circles, a bit too much so to be honest, but is still a well acted story of a woman(beautiful Claudia Cardinale) who comes to the west as a mail-order-bride, only to find that her would-be family was wiped out by a cold-hearted gunfighter(Henry Fonda, cast effectively against type). She nonetheless vows to carry on, and is later helped by a man known as Harmonica(Charles Bronson) who has also vowed to kill the same man that killed her family. Sprawling story details the westward expansion by train that transformed America irrevocably, ending many ways of life. I did like this film, it is stylish and ambitious, with a good score, but it does become tedious at times, not to mention uncomfortable(Fonda's scenes with Cardinale, for instance...) I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"", but film is still memorable, just not a ""classic"".  "
44028,tt0816692,AaronCapenBanner,united states,7,Time & Space,"Christopher Nolan directed this sprawling, ambitious science fiction tale set in the near-future that stars Mathew McConaughey as a pilot turned farmer named Cooper, forced into that life when famine and blight ravage the earth, forcing humankind to turn away from exploration, even concocting revisionist history that gets his daughter Murphy in trouble at school, but soon their lives will be dramatically altered when he is recruited in a top secret mission headed by Dr. Brand(played by Michael Caine) which will see him team up with Brand's daughter(played by Anne Hathaway) on a dangerous mission into a wormhole that just may save the human race, if they make it back in time... Big ideas at work here, and Nolan's direction is superb, as are the performances, though this story doesn't seem to know when to quit, and becomes far-fetched at the climax, but still remains an impressive film nonetheless. Will require multiple viewings.  "
45350,tt0034583,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,Classic WWII Romance & Intrigue.,"Michael Curtiz directed this fondly remembered, Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film that stars Humphrey Bogart as expatriate American Rick Blaine, who owns a popular nightclub in Casablanca in the early days of WWII. Rick tries to be neutral, but that proves difficult when he obtains two valuable letters of transit wanted by French freedom fighter Victor Laszlo(played by Paul Henreid) who brings his wife Ilsa Lund(played by Ingrid Bergman) with him, who by coincidence is an old flame of Rick's. When the Nazis come looking for Victor, Rick has to choose which side he is on, no matter the cost...Classic film is as well-loved as ""Gone With The Wind"", and while it lacks that film's sweeping narrative, does capture its time and place quite well, with superb acting and memorable dialogue, leading to famous finale.  "
46402,tt0054215,AaronCapenBanner,united states,10,Norman Bates.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this smash hit, a terrifying film that begins with dissatisfied Phoenix office worker Marion Crane(played by Janet Leigh) who impulsively steals $40,000 from her employer, and drives to California to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis(played by John Gavin). On the way, she trades in her car, and stops at a remote motel on a rainy night run by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins) who is a friendly but strange young man dominated by his mother. Marion decides to return to Phoenix with the money, but a fateful shower will end her chance of redemption...Her sister Lila(played by Vera Miles) enlists the help of Sam and a detective named Arbogast(played by Martin Balsam) to investigate Marion's disappearance, but are in for a shock regarding Norman... Brilliant horror film expertly manipulates audience expectations, and remains highly unpredictable and shocking. That iconic house is photographed quite menacingly at night(especially after the first murder) and the big reveal and final sequence is mesmerizing. Bernard Hermann's piercing and chilling score is unforgettable. My vote for Hitchcock's best film.  "
46813,tt0082971,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,High Adventure With Indiana.,"Harrison Ford makes his first appearance as Indiana Jones in this exciting, highly entertaining globe-trotting adventure, which finds archaeologist and college professor Jones pursuing Nazis who are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, with which they hope to use its mystical powers to help them conquer the world in Pre-World War II[1936] days. Harrison Ford became a huge star in his own right(not just as Han Solo) and is highly appealing and capable, really making Indiana come to life in this fantastic story, helped by a fine cast featuring Karen Allen, John Rhys Davies, and Denholm Elliot. Steven Spielberg directs in a breathless and inspired way, and this film is great fun(just don't ponder its credibility too closely...)  "
48938,tt0047396,AaronCapenBanner,united states,9,Lookout For Murder.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this classic suspense film that stars Jimmy Stewart as L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries, a photographer laid up in his New York apartment in a wheelchair after breaking his leg getting an action shot at an auto race. He has taken to spying on his neighbors from his rear window with a pair of binoculars, when he becomes convinced that his neighbor Lars Thorwald(played menacingly by Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. He tries to convince a police detective friend of his(played by Wendell Corey) but without proof, can do nothing. He then enlists his high society girlfriend(beautiful Grace Kelly) and his nurse(played by Thelma Ritter) to investigate, with unexpected and dangerous results... Brilliant film effectively blends witty humor and glamor with menace and murder. Incredibly suspenseful and compelling story, endearing characters, and superbly directed climax all make this a classic, not to be missed.  "
49835,tt0103064,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,Marvelous Sequel.,"Part II picks up many years later, when Sarah Connor is an inmate in a mental asylum(people did not believe her story). Her son John Connor is now a troubled boy, pursued not only by the police, but a new and more advanced Cyborg Killer, the T-1000, made of liquid metal, and seemingly unstoppable, until a familiar Cyborg shows up also in pursuit, not of John, put to protect him, and they must rescue his mother in order to stop this new threat, and save the future. Highly effective film is equally breathless and exciting,(if a bit too long) that picks up the story from the first in a very satisfying way, while creating its own mythology at the same time. Robert Patrick was also dead-on portraying a soulless killer cyborg, and the groundbreaking F/X are outstanding, and still hold up today. James Cameron has a knack for making sequels right!  "
52602,tt0088763,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,1985 To 1955.,"Robert Zemekis directed this hugely entertaining Time-travel adventure comedy as Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox) accidentally goes back in time 30 years in a De Leorean converted Time machine invented by his eccentric friend Dr. Emmet Brown(Christopher Lloyd). Once in 1955, he accidentally intervenes in how his parents met, resulting in him being threatened from temporal erasure! He enlists the aid of the younger Dr. Brown, to help him put things right, and get back to his future... A fine cast, witty and inventive script, and inspired direction make this a most entertaining adventure, very exciting and funny, and filled with charm, and good-natured humor about the differences in culture that 30 years can bring.  "
55724,tt0209144,AaronCapenBanner,united states,7,Puzzling Non-Linear Film.,"Christopher Nolan directs this truly original, mesmerizing, though puzzling film featuring Guy Pearce as a man suffering from amnesia, who, along with assistance from co-stars Joey Pantoliano & Carrie Ann Moss, try to unravel his identity, and the events that led up to his amnesia, though they may wish they hadn't... I couldn't give away the secret even if I wanted too, since the film is densely plotted, being revealed layer by layer, with the events told and retold so frequently, that it may be hard to figure it out after only one viewing, so multiple viewings are a must, even though one can take only so much of it at a time! Nonetheless, a most intriguing and fascinating experiment, worthy of Alfred Hitchcock!  "
57356,tt0078788,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,This Is The End...,"Francis Ford Coppola directs this fascinating but very strange, unique film about Army Captain Willard(Martin Sheen, fine shell-shocked performance) who is sent ""Up River"" on a secret mission to assassinate renegade Col. Kurtz(Marlon Brando, bizarre but unforgettable performance) who has apparently gone insane, abandoned his command, and now rules over a primitive people in the remote jungles of Vietnam. Story is far more involved than that though, especially in the expanded directors cut that is much longer, but also fascinating. Willard encounters many strange sights and people(even among his own crew) as he tries to make sense out of the enveloping madness of this war, and his own inner demons. Film is a visual marvel, and holds your attention as it unfolds its increasingly philosophical, even existentialist narrative. May take multiple viewings to fully comprehend, but is worth it.  "
57822,tt0482571,AaronCapenBanner,united states,8,Startling Magician Story.,"Christopher Nolan directs this imaginative, original, and quite unpredictable story of two rival magicians(played effectively by Christian Bale & Hugh Jackman) who escalate their rivalry when Jackman's wife dies, and blames Bale for it. This leads to increasingly daring magic tricks, each trying to sabotage the other, until a double-twist ending that no one saw coming... Film also fictionalizes a meeting with real inventor Tesla, who had experimented with new power sources and electricity, but was largely forgotten by history. In this story, he invents a machine that both magicians covet, but which doesn't work according to plan. Densely plotted but mesmerizing and superbly crafted story ends on a most surprising yet satisfying note. Just like a real magic trick, its all about deception and misdirection, so pay attention!  "
59481,tt0078748,AaronCapenBanner,united states,9,Terrifying.,"Highly effective Sci-Fi horror involving a spaceship crew intercepting an S.O.S. from a derelict ship on a desolate world, where one crewman becomes infected by a sinister organism, one that grows in size, and is difficult to kill... Extremely well directed and designed film has a great cast of actors who really bring them to life, especially Sigourney Weaver, debuting as Ripley. Alien creature itself is terrifying in this, its first appearance, and the story is intriguing and smart, alien planet highly atmospheric, suspense unrelenting. A true classic.  "
60129,tt0057012,AaronCapenBanner,united states,9,Hilarious Dark Comedy.,"Stanley Kubrick's ""dark nightmare"" comedy about rogue American Brigadier general Jack Ripper(!)(played by Sterling Hayden)who decides to launch a preemptive strike against Russia, and the frantic attempts of the White House and military to stop him, and prevent WWIII. Bold idea to make a nuclear war into a comedy, but Kubrick did so in order to show the insanity of the situation in the first place. Peter Sellers plays three different (but distinct) roles, and is incredible, aside from being hilarious, he shows what a fine actor he was, that he could pull off such a feat. Slim Pickens as Maj. ""King"" Kong, Keenan Wynn as Col.""Bat"" Guano(defender of the Coca-Cola company) and George C. Scott as general ""Buck"" Turgidson are equally superb in this classic film, which still holds up. Better watched than described!  "
60719,tt0043014,AaronCapenBanner,united states,7,Told From The Grave.,"Billy Wilder directed this dark comedy/drama that stars William Holden as hack writer Joe Gillis, desperate for work who agrees to see former silent movie queen Norma Desmond(played by Gloria Swanson) who has dreams of a big comeback in a picture directed by Cecil B. Demille,and wants Joe to write it, but in reality has become a delusional, even insane woman who lives in a self-contained world in her Hollywood home with her butler,and former director & husband, Max(played by Erich Von Stroheim) who remains steadfastly loyal. Joe and Norma start a relationship(she is still wealthy) but her jealousies grow out of hand leading to the inevitable outcome... Nancy Olsen and Jack Webb play Joe's concerned friends. Legendary film has many interesting and accurate things to say about that self-contained world called Hollywood, though only quibble is that this film is a little too out there, to the point it affects credibility by becoming a self-parody. Still, a witty and memorable film regardless.  "
61900,tt0050825,AaronCapenBanner,united states,10,World War I Madness,"Kirk Douglas stars as Col. Dax, who is chosen to defend a group of French soldiers selected by lot to represent their unit who have been charged with cowardice in battle after being forced into an impossible battle with opposing German forces from the trenches onto the front lines of World War I. An arrogant and glory seeking General(played memorably by George Macready) is responsible, but irrationally blames the men instead of his lunatic battle strategy. Sadly, the outcome is preordained, much to the indignation and sorrow of Dax. Stanley Kubrick directed this shattering masterpiece of the insanity of this war, and how arrogant and out-of-touch Generals get away with murder. Harrowing and realistically recreates battlefield conditions, and acting is superb all around, with a searing and insightful script, leading to a devastating ending that may leave the viewer in tears. Not to be missed.  "
63448,tt0081505,AaronCapenBanner,united states,9,Brilliant & Terrifying Film.,"Stanley Kubrick directed this (loose) adaptation of Stephen King's superb novel, about married couple Jack & Wendy Torrance(Jack Nicholson & Shelley Duvall) and their young son Danny who go to an isolated Colorado hotel as caretakers for the winter, when the hotel is forced to close. They are met by the head chef Dick Halloran(Scatman Crothers) who recognizes in Danny what he knows about himself: that they have powerful psychic abilities called ""Shining"" that alerts them to ghostly presences. Unfortunately for them, the hotel, called the Overlook, is indeed haunted with evil and violent ghosts that are determined to destroy them, and then add their spirits to those already there... Genuinely terrifying film is supremely well crafted and directed by Stanley Kubrick, made more frightening by the sinister banshee wailing music score that really gets under the viewer's hide. Fine performances by all, claustrophobic atmosphere and horrifying imagery in this top-class adaptation; though writer Stephen King disliked the changes made to his novel(author's privilege) this film is nonetheless among the top horror pictures ever made. Once seen, not easily forgotten...  "
67224,tt1345836,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,10,Best Of The Trilogy.,"Director Christopher Nolan, and star Christian Bale once again return, completing their trilogy in a highly effective and satisfying manner. Batman must defeat the plans of mysterious underworld figure Bane, who has a dark connection to his old teacher and the league of shadows, the sinister organization he thought destroyed. Thomas Hardy is superb as Bane, presented as a cult figure of sorts, as he is determined to bring down Gotham, exposing the facade of ""hero"" Harvey Dent, who, unknown to the public, turned bad and became a two-faced maniac. Batman took the blame instead, but this unselfish act will be thrown away by Bane, who talks of liberating Gotham and giving it back to the citizens, but of course it isn't as simple as that... Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle/Catwoman, and does a fine job too as Bruce Wayne's love interest, whom he desperately tries to reform. That is the theme here, that Batman should be just a symbol, inspiring good to overcome evil, and not give in to fear and darkness. More fantastic direction and action scenes to be found, and the ending, carefully foreshadowed and superbly orchestrated, will leave the viewer breathless and deeply moved. The perfect coda for this series, and an absolute triumph for all concerned. It will make you stand up and cheer.  "
70189,tt0090605,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,How To Do A Sequel Right!,"James Cameron took over directing duties from Ridley Scott, and like the original, directs this with remarkable intensity and suspense, as Ripley is rescued from her hyper sleep, and later persuaded to return to the same alien planet where all that horror she left behind comes back multiplied, after a colony stumbles upon the same derelict ship, and comes into contact with the merciless alien creatures... A model on how to produce a sequel; continue the original, building on the plot without repeating it, while at the same time respecting the past, and putting your own stamp on things. Just like the first, this is extremely effective in story, character development, and excitement, building to an action-packed and satisfying climax. One of the finest sequels ever made!  "
72078,tt0033467,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,10,It Is A Great Film.,"Orson Welles both directed and starred in this classic film, regarded by many as the greatest film ever made, which is a claim I have some sympathy with, though it isn't my choice. Still, this is a masterpiece, brilliantly weaving its narrative in flashback, as a group of reporters try to make sense out of wealthy Newspaper tycoon Charles Foster Kane's last words, ""Rosebud"", and interview the surviving people who knew him, like his best friend and colleague Jedediah Leland(memorably played by Joseph Cotton), his ex-wife Susan Alexander(played by Dorothy Comingore) and butler(played by Paul Stewart) who claims to have heard Kane say the famous word. What's most remarkable about this film is how innovative and fresh it still is, directed with energy and style that hasn't aged a bit. Script is brilliant, both funny and insightful, with lots of witty and quotable dialogue. Direction is atmospheric and fast-paced, with an effective use of shadows and looming camera angles that present Kane as a towering giant who overshadowed everyone, yet had a most tragic life, despite his wealth. An all-time classic not to be missed.  "
72884,tt0082096,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,The U-Boat,"Wolfgang Petersen directed this realistic and compelling film, spoken in German, with English subtitles,and told from the perspective of a German U-boat patrolling the Atlantic during World War II. The captain(played by Jurgen Prochnow) is a dedicated but war-weary man trying to keep his mostly young crew together during stressful times of either stifling boredom or nerve-wracking fear, as they face many life-threatening situations from the British forces they are battling, from both the sea and air. Starkly told, and quite claustrophobic, leading to a powerful closing sequence. Despite being a bit hard at times to differentiate all the characters, this is still quite involving.  "
73377,tt0053125,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Cross-Country Adventure.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this highly entertaining adventure film that stars Cary Grant as advertising executive Roger Thornhill, who, while in a New York hotel, is mistaken for government agent George Kaplan by a foreign spy ring led by Philip Vandamm(played by James Mason) who refuses to believe Roger when he insists it is a case of mistaken identity, after having him kidnapped. Roger manages to escape a deathtrap, but is thought to be a reckless drunk driver, and so goes on the run to prove his innocence, and fight the spies. On a train, he meets Eve Kendall(played by Eva Marie Saint) who helps him, but may not be all she seems either. Roger must dodge repeated assassination attempts, as he eventually makes it to their hideout atop Mount Rushmore. Leo G. Carroll plays a key role late in the film, and Martin Landau is fine as henchman Leonard. Grand scale adventure is wonderful entertainment, with memorable action scenes, performances, and a breathless pace. Contrived and far-fetched to be sure, but so well made that it doesn't matter.  "
73832,tt0052357,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Mesmerizing.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this mesmerizing film that stars Jimmy Stewart as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired San Francisco policeman who is approached by old college friend Gavin Elster(played by Tom Helmore) who wants him to follow his wife Madeline(played by Kim Novak) who has been acting strangely. Scottie does follow her, and becomes obsessed by her beauty and behavior, eventually falling in love with her, with devastating consequences. Though that is only the start of the mystery... Barbara Bel Geddes costars as Scottie's friend Midge, still in love with him, despite jilting him years before. Superbly directed and acted film has an ingenious story and stunning imagery, making this an unforgettable romantic mystery, with a stunning ending...though if you have the DVD, watch the extra feature on the lost extended ending, which is fascinating, and changes the tone of the film as a result!  "
74364,tt0086190,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,The Saga Ends...Until The Sequel Trilogy!,"Episode VI is a very entertaining end to the original trilogy, which picks up the plot threads from the previous entry, which sees Luke rescuing both Han Solo and Princess Leia from the clutches of the vile Jabba The Hut(exciting sequence) then regroup on the moon of Endor, where one last, devastating attack on the empire is planned, even though the evil Emperor knows all about it, and will use Darth Vader's connection to Luke to destroy them once and for all... For the most part, a satisfying end to the story, is a lot of fun, though hurt because (1) the Ewoks are too cuddly and childish, especially when seen as an adult, in conjunction with the other installments, and (2) The story is uninspired to an extent, being a virtual reprise of the end of 'A New Hope'. Still, this wouldn't bother kids, especially myself on first viewing, who just loved it, and watched them all over and over!  "
75485,tt0112573,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,10,Freedom!,"Mel Gibson both directed and starred as Scottish rebel and warrior William Wallace in this Academy Award winning (best picture and director) account of how Wallace led a revolt against the ruthless English King Edward the I(Longshanks) who oppressed the Scottish people in his attempt to wear both the crowns of England and Scotland. Wallace had lost a father & brother as a young man, now as an adult, his love was murdered by English soldiers after fighting rape, and an enraged Wallace vows revenge, though Edward I(played by Patrick McGoohan) is not so easily defeated, Wallace's valiant efforts in battle made him legend... Magnificent film is stirring and exciting, and at 3 hrs. is never tedious, but remarkably compelling, with superb performances, direction, and breathtaking battle scenes; a moving(though brutal) ending for Wallace. Some historical liberties are forgivable in modern-day classic.  "
79418,tt0066921,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Highly Controversial & Disturbing.,"Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of the Anthony Burgess novel must rank as one of the most controversial and disturbing mainstream films ever made. Story deals with a young hooligan named Alex(vividly brought to life by Malcolm McDowell) who leads a gang of vicious young British thugs as they mercilessly terrorize various innocent people, when their not fighting with other gangs. Alex breaks up the gang, and is captured by the authorities, who make him the willing subject of an experiment where all the aggressive thoughts are wiped from his mind, leaving him practically helpless later, when he is declared ""cured"" and sent back into society, where he will then reap what he has sewn... Of course, that's part of the point, that unless you cure society of the very thing you would cure an individual, you will still be left with a problem. Seeing Alex get punished by those he victimized is without doubt satisfying(Charles Bronson would have shot these punks dead without a second thought in his ""Death Wish"" films!)So Kubrick puts the viewer in the exact position of the avenging victims, which can also be uncomfortable on reflection, but we know exactly what Alex did, though was that part of him really cured? Is it dead? Or can it be revived? The difference between violence being sanctioned or unsanctioned, depending on whether they work for the government or not(as some of the gang will...) Kubrick gives the audience much to consider in this shocking film, not always easy to watch(to say the least) but one that cannot be easily dismissed either, though it was banned for years, but can now be seen on DVD.  "
80112,tt0075314,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,5,Disturbing & Jarring Drama.,"Robert De Nero plays disturbed Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle, who is sickened by the decadence he sees in society, as he drives the night shift in a taxi for a living. He becomes fascinated by an attractive campaign worker(Cybill Shepherd) for a presidential candidate, though her friend(played by Albert Brooks) doesn't like him, she agrees to go on a date with him, much to her later regret. Travis also tries to a help a twelve year old prostitute(Jodie Foster, excellent) to escape her squalid life. Events take a violent turn when he confronts her pimp(Harvey Keitel), and after his unsuccessful attempt on the life of the politician, decides to take on the pimp instead.... De Nero is excellent portraying this sleep-deprived and morally confused man, and director Martin Scorsese effectively creates a hellish atmosphere for the New York streets, but this film is simply far too unpleasant and jarring to succeed. The final shootout and aftermath is so bizarre and ugly, not to mention unbelievable, that it torpedoes the positive aspects, and becomes a misfire, though it is highly acclaimed by some.  "
80304,tt0036775,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Early Film Noir.,"Billy Wilder directed this early film noir that stars Fred MacMurray as insurance salesman Walter Neff, who one day meets the wife of one of his clients, a Mr. Dietrichson. His wife Phyllis(played by Barbara Stanwyck) is a devious woman who convinces Walter to join her in a plot to kill her husband for the insurance money. Walter has the idea of making it a double indemnity policy which will pay out twice the amount for accidental death. After they arrange his murder, Insurance investigator Barton Keyes(played by Edward G. Robinson) becomes suspicious of Phyllis, and thinks she arranged the death with another man, not knowing it is his friend Walter... Well directed and written mystery with Robinson stealing the picture with his crafty performance(an early version of ""Columbo"") Indeed, his is the only character you can root for...the lead characters get what they deserve!  "
80609,tt0056172,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Sweeping Desert Drama.,"David Lean directed this sweeping,(and Academy Award winning best picture and director) historical account of the life of T.E. Lawrence(played unforgettably by Peter O'Toole) who is a young intelligence officer in Cairo during WWI sent to investigate the Arab revolt against the Turks. Amazingly, he does more than that, as he somehow manages to lead them himself in their guerrilla attacks against the Turks! For two years he succeeds, but then is called upon to lead this army against the Ottoman Empire. Alec Guiness, Omar Sharif, Jack Hawkins, Anthony Quinn, & Anthony Quayle costar. Superbly directed and acted film is certainly long, and Lawrence does remain an enigma throughout, but the skill of the exquisite visuals and sumptuous score make up for it.  "
80952,tt0056592,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Powerful Courtroom Drama,"Gregory Peck plays Atticus Finch, an Alabama lawyer who is called upon to defend a black man(played by Brock Peters) who is wrongfully accused of raping a white woman(played by Collin Wilcox) in the 1930's, where such an allegation could get him lynched before a trial. Story also includes Atticus's two children Scout & Jem, and the film is mostly seen from their POV, as they try to understand what's going on and why. Robert Duvall plays a mysterious figure named Boo Radley(played by Robert Duvall) who will have a huge impact on their lives. Superb film with an Academy Award winning performance by Gregory Peck, and fine direction by Robert Mulligan, who creates an evocative atmosphere of small town Alabama life of this period, and the wonder yet naivety of childhood. A first-rate adaptation of Harper Lee's famous novel.  "
83373,tt0086879,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Salieri Too!,"Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents. F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy... Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good.  "
83451,tt0093058,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,R. Lee Ermey.,"R. Lee Ermey dominates this Stanley Kubrick directed Vietnam War drama, as he plays profane, no-nonsense, ultra tough Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who belittles, browbeats, and insults the marine recruits in brutal boot camp training. Vincent D'Onofrio plays a slow-witted recruit who gets it the worst from Hartman, until he finds out that he is quite good at shooting... Mathew Modine plays ""Joker"", since he has an overt sense of humor that also captures the attention of Hartman, whose relentless, unmerciful verbal attacks take their toll in ways he didn't imagine... Film then picks up later, as Joker is a war correspondent for Stars & Stripes, who witnesses first hand the insanity of Vietnam... R. Lee Ermey so dominates the first half of the film(in an unforgettable, searing portrayal of dehumanization) that, when his part is over, it leaves a looming shadow over the rest of the film that is never lifted, though it is still a well-presented look at the war, though nothing exceptional. Worth watching for Ermey, who should have received an Academy Award!  "
83945,tt0070735,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Fun Caper Comedy.,"Paul Newman & Robert Redford reunite for this Academy Award winning film directed by George Roy Hill about two con men who team up to avenge the death of a mutual friend by ""stinging"" a mob boss(played by Robert Shaw). Film details their intricate plan to do so, which involves an excellent cast including Charles Durning, Ray Walston, & Eileen Brennan, among others. The story climaxes in an elaborate swindle that may well fool the audience. Fine use of vintage 1930's jazz music appropriate for the period. Wouldn't go so far as giving it the best picture award, however, since it is just a good film, not in any way a great one, though it was a big hit at the time.  "
84971,tt0062622,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,10,Dazzling Masterpiece.,"Stanley Kubrick's visually dazzling, intellectually stimulating and ambitious film makes one of the best uses of the medium known as cinema ever made. Film begins when humans were still apes, and how, when one of them touches a huge, mysterious monolith, he is pushed forward in evolution, and uses an old bone as a tool(to smash and kill of course...) Thousands of years later, man is now on the moon, and another monolith is uncovered, inspiring a spaceship crew to investigate, causing the on board ship computer HAL9000 to malfunction(sensing the oncoming next evolution it cannot experience?) One astronaut enters the monolith, and he(and the viewer) see an astonishing, even overwhelming assault on the senses that leads to... Well, for those who haven't seen it, no spoilers, but just consider how a ""star child"" fits in at the end... A unique achievement in film history, not to be missed.  "
89135,tt0059578,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,"Better than First ""Dollars"".","Clint Eastwood returns as the Man with no name, a wandering gunfighter, now bounty hunter, who, along with Col. Mortimor(played by the appealing and steely-eyed Lee Van Cleef)is after a big bounty on crazy Indio(Gian Maria Vollante)and his gang. Both men distrust each other at first, but come to an understanding, and form a partnership, pledging to split the reward money; that is of course, dependent on them surviving the ordeal, involving Eastwood infiltrating the gang... Marvelous sequel is much better, thanks to two unforgettable lead performances, and incredibly stylish direction by Sergio Leone and music score by Mr. Morricone. Long but involving story is most compelling, and film remains a firm classic.  "
89856,tt0053604,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Office & Home Comedy.,"Billy Wilder directed this Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film that stars Jack Lemmon as C.C. Baxter, a poor accountant at a big New York Insurance firm. He tries to get ahead by loaning his apartment out to higher-ranking executives(like Ray Walston)for their illicit affairs, in order to curry favor and get a promotion. One day, the company boss Mr. Sheldrake(played by Fred MacMurray) also requests the use of the apartment, which is fine, except it involves the elevator girl named Fran Kuberlik(played by Shirley MacLaine) that he is secretly in love with. How is Baxter going to handle this problem and keep his job? Classic film works as both comedy and drama, with a fine cast and script that involves you in their plight, in a believable and poignant way.  "
90132,tt0086250,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Tony Montana,"Brian De Palma directed this updated remake of the 1932 film with Paul Muni. Here, Al Pacino plays Cuban immigrant(and Castro political exile) Tony Montana, who arrives in America with his friend Manny(played by Steven Bauer) and immediately goes to work for the drug cartels, nearly getting murdered at first, but Tony is a determined survivor, and gradually works his way to the top of the Miami underworld, where, despite his wealth and beautiful wife Elvira(played by Michele Pfeifer) he finds himself bored and dissatisfied, though a betrayal of a rival crime boss and obsession with his younger sister Gina will prove to be his downfall... Though extremely violent and profane, not to mention long, this film is still a guilty pleasure, with a most entertainingly over-the-top performance by Pacino and energetic direction, plus a most glorious go-for-broke ending.  "
90908,tt0097576,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Indiana Jones Returns To Form.,"Third Indiana Jones film is a big improvement over the heavy handed 'Temple Of Doom', telling a more straight-forward story involving Indiana(Harrison Ford of course) going in search of both his missing father(Sean Connery, very well cast) and the Holy Grail, which entangles him once again with Nazis[1938 setting] and a brief meeting with Adolf Hitler... Steven Spielberg directs this globe-trotting adventure without missing a beat, and has the welcome return of Denholm Elliot and John Rhys Davies to the cast. Fine British actor Julian Glover plays the villain, and beautiful Allison Doody his conflicted love interest. Film is great fun all around, right until the rousing ending. Some story elements may not be new, but are still put across in a most entertaining package.  "
92234,tt0042192,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Seatbelts Fastened!,"Joseph L. Mankiewicz directed this multi-Academy Award winning(best picture, director, and screenplay) film about the rise of Eve Harrington(played by Anne Baxter) a conniving stage actress whose ruthless climb to success comes at the expense of her ""idol"" Margo Channing(played by Bette Davis) whom she first befriends, then later undermines by disrupting the lives of her director boyfriend(played by Gary Merrill) and her screenwriter friends(played by Hugh Marlowe and Celeste Holm) But it is cynical and acerbic critic Addison De Witt(played by George Sanders in an Academy Award winning best supporting acting performance) that retells the story of Eve, who sees right through her act, and discovers her hidden past. Superb film with exceptional acting and directing, and has one of the best-written screenplays in cinema history, filled with witty lines, originality, and biting cynicism. Not a heart-warmer by any stretch, but immensely satisfying all the same.  "
94150,tt0372784,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Batman Back On Track.,"After the dreadful camping-up that the Joel Schumacher Batmans were, talented director Christopher Nolan re-invents the origin of Batman/Bruce Wayne in highly dramatic and effective fashion, aided considerably by the fine actor Christian Bale, who is properly innocent at first, but then after many years of wandering, returns to Gotham to clean up the corrupt streets and battle multiple threats, from within and without, as a fearless ""Dark Knight"" determined to strike fear in criminals using his acquired skills. This Batman doesn't have superpowers or comedic sidekicks, but is a brooding loner who resolves to protect his beloved Gotham no matter the personal or physical cost to himself. Excellent supporting cast has Michael Caine as his loyal and wise butler Alfred, Gary Oldman as police commissioner Gordon, and Liam Neeson, teacher turned nemesis. A magnificent production transcends even what Tim Burton achieved; demands multiple viewings.  "
95049,tt0040897,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,The Curse Of Greed.,"John Huston directed(and has a cameo role in) this classic tale of greed and adventure that stars Humphrey Bogart & Tim Holt as Fred C. Dobbs & Bob Curtin, two downtrodden Americans living in Tampico Mexico who team up with old-time prospector Howard(played by Walter Huston) to search for gold in the Sierra Madre mountains. At first united and friendly, the curse of greed takes hold of Dobbs(despite his initial assurances that no such thing could happen!) when they do strike it rich, but he becomes suspicious and paranoid, which is made worse by the harsh elements and Mexican bandits who threaten them, leading to inevitable tragedy and death... Superbly directed and acted film portrays its remote setting well; though the plot developments aren't surprising, they are told with such skill that it doesn't matter. Contains the classic line: ""Badges? We don't need no stinking badges!""  "
95349,tt0053291,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,6,Wild Comedy.,"Billy Wilder directed this wild comedy that stars Jack Lemmon & Tony Curtis as two out-of-work Chicago musicians who accidentally witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre committed by Spats Columbo(played by George Raft). Desperate to get out of town, they take the first job available: in an all-girls band as replacements players! Of course, they have to disguise themselves as women, which leads to complications when the meet Sugar Cane(played by Marilyn Monroe) the knockout beauty of the band. Once in Florida, they devise a way to stay undercover and avoid Spats, who is on the way... Overpraised comedy is well acted and reasonably funny, though the first half is better than the silly second, and this goes on too long as well. Still, the good cast makes it just about work.  "
96045,tt0105695,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,6,Dark Western.,"Clint Eastwood both directs and stars in this Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film, a western featuring Eastwood as aging reformed gunfighter Will Munny, lured out of retirement to collect a much needed bounty on the group of cowboys who cut up a prostitute. He enlists the aid of friend Ned Logan(played by Morgan Freeman) to help him track them down, which leads to the town led by corrupt sheriff ""Little Bill""(played by Gene Hackman,who also won an Oscar) an amiable but ruthless man who resents these gunfighters in his town, and will stop at nothing,(not even murder) to get his way, prompting a violent showdown on a rainy night... Superb acting and script here, and works as a tribute to Clint's mentor director Sergio Leone, though this sometimes ponderous and overlong film doesn't measure up to their famous ""Man With No Name"" trilogy. Still, it is well done and memorable otherwise, with a haunting finale.  "
96705,tt0041959,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Harry Lime,"Orson Welles stars in Carol Reed's adaptation of the Graham Greene story, which sees Joseph Cotton playing pulp novelist Holly Martins, who has arrived in post-war Vienna at the invitation of old friend Harry Lime(Welles) a mysterious man who has reportedly been killed in a peculiar traffic accident. Holly decides to investigate matters, and meets up with Lime's girlfriend Anna Smith(played by Alida Valli) whom he also falls in love with, much to his later regret, as she is still very loyal to Lime, who may not be dead after all, and not such a nice guy... Brilliantly directed and written film features fine performances by all, with a most atmospheric feel to its post-war setting, and the new morality that has taken hold. Bittersweet film is quite cynical, oppressively so at times, but is nonetheless memorable, with lots of quotable dialogue, and a haunting finale.  "
97861,tt0095016,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,An Office Building,"John McTiernan directed this big action hit starring Bruce Willis as New York police officer John McClane, who is visiting his wife Holly(played by Bonnie Bedelia) at her job in Los Angeles in a big high rise office building. While changing his clothes, John is stunned to learn that terrorists led by Hans Gruber(played by Alan Rickman) have taken over, and are threatening to kill the hostages unless their demands are met, though it turns out their motives are mercenary rather than political. John must find a way to defeat these crooks, even if he is alone... Highly exciting and intelligent thriller with a star-making performance by Willis as wise-cracking but tough McClane, and Rickman also quite good as steely villain. First of a series of films.  "
98289,tt0057115,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Grand Entertainment.,"John Sturges(""The Magnificent Seven"") directs this superb, highly entertaining and action packed World War II film about Air Force officers sequestered in a POW camp by their Nazi captors. These men(played memorably by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, James Donald, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, among others) are all escape artists, and the Nazis think that, by putting them ""all in one basket"", that they will be easier to keep an eye on...a mistake, since they instead dig three big tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry, to embark on a great mass escape. A classic of its kind, moves at a fast pace(despite being long, it never feels that way) and is highly involving as a story and in its characters. This is even based on a true story!  "
99171,tt0071315,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Sad Story Of Corruption,"Roman Polanski directed this complex but fascinating story of corruption that stars Jack Nicholson as private detective J.J. Gittes, who is hired by a woman named Evelyn Mulwray to see if her husband(a water department official) is cheating. It turns out he is, but things take a strange turn when the husband is found dead, and the woman who hired him was an impostor. The real Evelyn Mulwray(played by Faye Dunaway) claims to know nothing of the affair, but Gittes continues to investigate, which leads him to wealthy land owner Noah Cross(played by John Houston) who has shady dealings going on, and also wants to find his granddaughter, which Evelyn knows something about... Superbly directed and acted film is quite uncomfortably cynical and downbeat at times, especially the ending, but remains a fine(updated) throwback to classic film noir.  "
101102,tt0047296,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,A Story Of Courage & Redemption.,"Elia Kazan directed this multi-Academy Award winning(best picture & director) film that stars Marlon Brando(Academy Award winner for best actor)as Terry Molloy, a former prizefighter who missed the big time, and now works as a small-time enforcer for corrupt union boss of the dock workers Johnny Friendly(played by Lee J. Cobb) who is not above murder to get his way, which includes a man whose sister Edie Doyle(played by Academy Award winning best supporting actress Eva Marie Saint) Terry falls in love with, and ends up helping her take down Friendly, though his brother Charley(played by Rod Steiger) warns him to back off, though after Charley is dispatched, Terry allies himself with crusading Father Berry(played by Karl Malden) to expose the corruption as a government witness, leading to a final showdown on the docks... Superb drama with excellent script, direction, and acting, especially Brando, who is unforgettable, willing to pay a high price to do the right thing(his poor pigeons...) making himself a contender in God's good graces in the process.  "
102290,tt0050212,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Madness!,"David Lean directed this superb, Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film set in a Japanese WWII POW camp for British(and one American) soldiers. Alec Guiness(Academy Award winner for best actor) stars as Col. Nicholson, who is subjected to harsh treatment(the sweat box) by Col. Saito in defiance of his authority, and for the respect he and his men are entitled to. Saito gives in, and Nicholson then proceeds with the original plan to build a railway bridge in the jungle to help the Japanese with their resupplying efforts. William Holden plays the American among them who escapes to freedom, but is persuaded to return with a Major Warden(played by Jack Hawkins) on a mission to destroy the bridge that Nicholson is now determined to complete! Fine war film and character study about personal vs. patriotic motives in war, and how they can both collide and collude... Memorable ending and final quote says it all.  "
102489,tt0031679,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,All-Too Timely Drama/Comedy.,"Frank Capra directed this classic political comedy/drama, which stars Jimmy Stewart as naive but pure Jefferson Smith, who is appointed to the Senate to replace a deceased senator. The political machine headed by evil Jim Taylor(played by Edward Arnold) thinks that simple Smith will be easy to control, and not stir controversy because he isn't a crony. He is befriended by veteran Senator Joseph Paine(played by Claude Rains) who has been gradually corrupted and cowed by the rotten political bosses. When Smith proves to be his own man, who can't be corrupted or bribed, Taylor uses Paine to concoct a phony scandal related to a bill Jefferson was trying to get passed, leading to a filibuster at his senate hearing...Jean Arthur plays his ally won over by his sincerity. Outstanding film is even better today, with an intelligent and insightful script about political corruption and the destruction of anyone who dares to stand up to the political machine(partisanship) that rules it is sadly still relevant today. Jimmy Stewart is excellent, and was deserving of an Academy Award(he didn't win) for his entirely believable and impassioned performance. Script pulls no punches either, with a particularly shocking scene of youngsters trying to spread the truth about Mr. Smith being run off the road or beaten up by thugs! Stirring ending may be wish-fulfillment to an extent, but I for one wouldn't have wanted it to end any other way!  "
102858,tt0083658,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,5,Replicants,"Ridley Scott directed this adaptation of the Philip K. Dick story that stars Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, a retired replicant(enhanced human clones used on colony worlds with limited lifespans but unstable personalities) hunter called back into service to locate and destroy a group of replicants that have returned to Earth to kill their creator. The worst of them is Roy Batty(played by Rutger Hauer) who becomes Deckard's chief opponent. Though visually striking and quite imaginative, what is sorely lacking is a compelling story with relatable characters, since this film is otherwise cold and uninvolving. Still, the acting is fine, and it has become a huge cult favorite, but though I have repeatedly tried, I just can't get into it.  "
105074,tt0055031,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Post-WWII Courtroom Drama.,"Stanley Kramer directed this powerful courtroom drama based on fact, and set in post-WWII Europe, as respected American Judge Dan Haywood(played by Spencer Tracy) is chosen to preside over the trial of four German judges(led by Ernst Janning, played by Burt Lancaster) accused of legalizing Nazi atrocities like sterilization and murder. Still, there is much pressure put on Haywood to show leniency, which is difficult to do when the witnesses(played by Judy Garland & Montgomery Clift, among others) are so sympathetic, and the defense attorney(played by Maximilian Schell in an Academy Award winning performance) is so harsh. Richard Widmark & William Shatner costar as the local American military officers. Compelling and thoughtful(if a bit long) drama with superb performances and direction making this a must-see.  "
110365,tt1205489,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Get Off My Lawn!,"Clint Eastwood both directs and stars in this drama, playing Walt Kowalski, a Korean War veteran and recent widower who hates the cultural changes in the world, and his Michigan neighborhood in particular, which has an ever-growing group of Hmong refugees as citizens. One of them, a young man named Thao, under pressure from his gang friends, tries to steal Walt's prized 1972 Gran Torino automobile, but is stopped by Walt, who almost shoots him. Thao's family is deeply ashamed by this behavior, and after Walt busts up a gang threatening them near his lawn, will do anything to appease him, and won't take no for an answer. Walt finds to his surprise that, despite the ethnic differences, this family shares much of his values, so he decides to take Thao under his wing to reform him, although the dangerous gang is still out for revenge, prompting Walt(who learns that he is dying of cancer), to take drastic action... Intelligent and moving film avoids clich«∏s to tell a story of redemption and understanding. Sure, this is similar to John Wayne in ""The Shootist"" but this film works well; it is a bit long, and almost goes wrong once or twice, but pulls it together with a clever and fitting final act of redemption and heroism from Walt.  "
111815,tt0077416,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,5,Heartfelt But Unconvincing.,"Michael Cimino directs this long character study & war picture that follows a group of friends from a wedding, to a deer hunting trip, to finally the Vietnam war and its aftermath. Over three hour film details their lives before & after the war, on both the men and their families. Fine cast includes Robert De Nero, Christopher Walken, and Meryl Streep, who all deliver heartfelt and believable performances, but the trouble is that the extended POW sequence involving Russian Roulette just feels so bizarre and extreme, that I had a hard time buying it, especially when one of the characters becomes obsessed with it after their ordeal is over. Somehow, this drags the film down, and by the end, instead of feeling emotionally drained(like many of the audience claimed) the film felt emotionally muted, like it had gone too far afield and lost sight of what it was supposed to be about. Still, a minority view I suppose, since it did win an Academy Award for best picture and director.  "
112569,tt0046912,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,H For Hitchcock.,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this thriller, adapted from the successful stage play, that stars Ray Milland as a professional Tennis player who plots to murder his unfaithful wife(beautiful Grace Kelly) who had an affair with a writer(played by Robert Cummings). She is remorseful, but he now wants to inherit her wealth, and so he blackmails a Captain Lesgate (played by Anthony Dawson) to murder her. This plan backfires though, forcing him to improvise a plan B, which may be even better, though the chief inspector on the case(played by John Williams) is suspicious... Stylish mystery with good direction and acting, and effectively plays off its stagy setting. Viewer sympathy will be squarely with Grace Kelly here, though, which may or may not be the point...  "
113313,tt0031381,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Epic Civil War Romantic Drama,"Victor Fleming and George Cukor co-directed this extremely popular, Academy Award winning(best picture and direction) story about the Civil War coming to Tara, a plantation in Atlanta run by the O'Hara family. Daughter Scarlett(played by Vivien Leigh) is spoiled but beautiful, and has lots of admirers, but she has eyes on Ashley(played by Leslie Howard) who is in love with Melanie(played by Olivia De Havilland). This frustrates her, but she soon turns her attentions to roguish blockade runner Rhett Butler(played by Clark Gable) who loves her, but has no intention of being bullied by her. When the Civil War finally starts, Tara will be torn apart, as things will never be the same again... Superbly mounted production with a stirring score and fine performances. The two leads are not particularly admirable in character, but this remains compelling storytelling, memorably showing the passing of a whole way of life.  "
114217,tt0032976,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Gothic Romance,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this Gothic romance that stars Sir Laurence Olivier as Maxim De Winter, a recently widowed(and quite wealthy) man vacationing in Monte Carlo who meets the paid companion(played by Joan Fontaine) of a older woman. They unexpectedly fall in love and get married. They then return to his home in Cornwall, a country estate called Manderly ruled over by the imposing housekeeper Mrs. Danvers(played by Judith Anderson) who holds sacred the memory of the first Mrs. De Winter Rebecca, who died mysteriously in a boating accident. As events unfold, the new Mrs. De Winter will discover things about Maxim's past that will come to haunt her... Impressively directed and acted film is still melodramatic stuff given a high gloss, but remains entertaining and atmospheric, though hardly deserved to beat ""The Grapes Of Wrath"" for best picture of 1940!  "
115093,tt0061512,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Failure To Communicate,"Paul Newman gives a fine performance in director Stuart Rosenberg's tale of ""born loser"" Lucas 'Luke' Jackson, who is sentenced to a southern chain gang after he, in a drunken stupor, cut the tops off a row of parking meters. The captain of the chain gang(Strother Martin, superb) tries to tell the new men that he doesn't want any trouble, so he wont give any trouble. The overseer of the chain gang at work is called ""Boss""(Morgan Woodward, memorable in his shaded sunglasses, and never says a word!) George Kennedy plays ""Dragline"", the veteran of the group who dislikes Luke at first, but later changes his mind when he sees how defiant Luke is, with his repeated escape attempts and eating 50 eggs. The captain is determined to break Luke, in order to make an example of him, and squash this ""cool hand"" talk. Fine character study with solid performances and an insightful script that deals with defiance of authority, and one's fate as a consequence, and whether such a thing is even wise in the circumstances. Luke is no saint, though sympathetic, and certainly no role model, which is the central point I think...  "
115333,tt0167404,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Sight,"M. Night Shyamalan directed this superbly crafted tale that stars Bruce Willis as Dr. Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist who has an eventful night where he receives an award, then is shot by a disgruntled ex-patient(played by Donnie Wahlberg). Later on, he is assigned the case of a young boy named Cole Sear(played by Haley Joel Osment) who claims to see ghosts which terrify him(and alienates him from his schoolmates), which troubles his disbelieving mother(played by Toni Collette) while Malcolm tries to reconnect with his wife(played by Olivia Williams). The truth of the situation will come as quite a shock to Crowe by the end... Chilling film with outstanding direction and performances(particularly Osment, who is superb) and a smart script. Astute viewers may see the final twist coming, but that doesn't lessen its impact.  "
117261,tt2488496,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,5,Sound and Fury,"Long-delayed seventh episode which happened because creator George Lucas sold the rights to Disney(from Fox studios), which produced this first of the sequel trilogy set thirty years later, and sees the return of original stars Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Mark Hamill...barely. Despite the happy ending to ""Return Of The Jedi"", it seems everything later went to seed, and a new Empire called The First Order(led by the angry and wayward Kylo Ren, apprentice to the mysterious and Emperor-like Snoke) has arisen from its ashes, while new characters(like Finn and Rey) meet up with our heroes to fight this new evil, which will come at a high cost indeed for some... Despite raking in a huge amount of money based on the fond memories of the original trilogy, this new chapter(directed by J.J. Abrams) disappoints, literally being all sound and fury, signifying very little. To see Episode VI being undone and made meaningless is a really sour premise for this story, which is otherwise a virtual copy of ""A New Hope"" right down to a new Death Star, now even bigger than ever, but just as vulnerable to attack! A new droid named BB-8 is a delight, and there are nice little touches and familiar cameos, but otherwise this bleak and depressing film was not worth waiting 30+ years for. A wasted opportunity.  "
120094,tt0084787,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Superior Remake.,"John Carpenter directed this superior remake of the 1951 original, based on the famous short story ""Who Goes There?"". Kurt Russell plays a pilot(R.J. Macready) in an American research base in the Antarctic, that one day is confronted by a helicopter with two people trying to kill a dog with a rifle. The two men come from a Norwegian base, and after both of them are killed, Macready flies them over to that base, where they find the remains of an alien spacecraft, and a thawed out block of ice, along with some frozen mutilated remains of the Norwegians who are brought back to the American base, which is soon overrun with the revived alien life forms after both the dog reveals itself to be a thing, and there is still life in the bodies being autopsied... Extremely effective horror/Sci-Fi/ remake creates a palpable sense of fear and paranoia among the all-male cast, memorably acted by all, and impressively made with groundbreaking F/X that are quite believable and hold up today. One of the rare remakes better than the original, and actually has a point to it! Not usually the case sadly...  "
122228,tt0758758,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,One Man's Jouney,"Based on the Jon Krakauer non-fiction bestseller about Christopher McCandless(played by Emile Hirsh) a young man who had just graduated from college who decides to put his future on hold to fulfill a personal ambition to hitchhike to Alaska(after abandoning his disabled car) in order to survive in the wilderness on his own, living off what he can hunt and gather from the land. Along the way, he meets all kinds of people like Ron Franz(played by Hal Holbrook), a lonely old man who wants to adopt Chris, but he politely refuses, since he isn't orphaned, having two worried parents(played by William Hurt & Marcia Gay Harden) as well as a sister(played by Jena Malone) back home, who serves as narrator of his life, which will have a most tragic end... Superb version of the fascinating book has fine acting by all, especially Hirsh, and exquisite direction by Sean Penn. Does leave out certain (potentially) unappealing parts of Chris' personality, but well captures the yearning to be one with nature, and rebel against a modern society he dislikes. Haunting final words from a postcard he sent: ""I now walk into the wild""...  "
126638,tt0025316,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,A Memorable Night Indeed.,"Frank Capra directs Clark Gable & Claudette Colbert, who star in this Academy Award winning(Best Picture, director, actor, actress, screenplay) comedy as Gable plays reporter Peter Warne, who stumbles onto a huge story when he discovers that runaway heiress bride Ellie Andrews is on a bus, and trying to conceal her identity. Peter confronts Ellie with a choice: Stick with me so I can get an exclusive story, or I call your father right now. She agrees, and so begins a road picture, as they later leave the bus and are forced to walk and hitchhike, until he can get her back home, assuming they don't fall in love of course... Hilarious comedy with two lead characters you like and care about, and many memorable scenes. Frank Capra had a deft comedic touch, as do the actors, and resulting film is wonderful, if undeniably predictable.  "
128078,tt0091763,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Vietnam,"Oliver Stone directed this powerfully told account of the Vietnam war that stars Charlie Sheen as recent recruit Chris Taylor, who arrives in Vietnam with enthusiasm, but quickly realizes that this war is not what he expected, as he is disrespected by the more seasoned soldiers for his inexperience, and shocked by the lack of purpose he finds in the conflict, which is personified by his two non-commissioned officers, Barnes(played by Tom Berenger) & Elias(played by Willem Dafoe) who hate each other, and are polar opposites in philosophy and approach. Chris will eventually bond with his fellow soldiers, which will be painful later when so many are killed... Realistic and believable film with fine performances and direction, though isn't always easy to watch. Won the Academy Awards for best picture and director.  "
128526,tt0074958,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,10,All-Time Classic Satire.,"Sidney Lumet directs this Paddy Chayefsky satire about a fictional network(UBS) languishing in the ratings, which strikes gold when, after their recently fired long-time anchorman Howard Beale(Peter Finch) offhandedly remarks on air that he will kill himself, they receive a ratings spike. They send Beale out again to clarify, but instead he gives a stunning editorial rant, and the ratings go even higher. After his rage-filled cry to the viewers telling them to cry out of their windows ""I'm Mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore!"" he becomes a superstar, boosting UBS into a top-rated network, inspiring it to create even more wild programs, though their only real interest is high ratings, and if they go down for any reason... William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Robert Duvall, Beatrice Straight, and Ned Beatty are all superb, but it is Peter Finch as the ""mad prophet of our times"" Howard Beale that steals the film. Finch(in an Academy Award winning performance) is unforgettable, delivering a searing, mesmerizing performance of insanity, yet at the same time wisdom, because everything he says comes true in the film, and still holds true today, in which television hasn't only matched the craziness of 1976, but far surpassed it(Reality television of all varieties that is cheap to produce yet shameless and lowest-common-denominator trash.) Howard Beale was both a condemner of television, yet a product of it, it made him, and eventually destroyed him, and is just as relevant a symbol of it now as he was then. Thought-provoking and hilarious, this film is a timeless classic satire that has long since come true...  "
130096,tt0033870,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Classic Detective Picture.,"John Huston directed this all-time classic detective picture that stars Humphrey Bogart as San Francisco private detective Sam Spade, who takes the case of a mysterious woman named Brigid O'Shaughnessy(played by Mary Astor) Things quickly turn violent when his partner Miles Archer is murdered, and Sam finds himself in trouble with the law,and soon meets up with two more suspicious characters called Kasper Gutman(played by Sydney Greenstreet) & Joel Cairo(played by Peter Lorre) who are in search of a valuable statue called the Maltese Falcon, which is worth a fortune, but has proved elusive to obtain. Elisha Cook Jr. costars as inexperienced gunman Wilmer Cook. Superbly written, directed, and acted picture is a treat from start to finish, with witty dialogue and atmosphere to burn, leading to unforgettable finale. Not to be missed.  "
130372,tt0064115,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,5,Newman & Redford.,"Paul Newman & Robert Redford play Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid in director George Roy Hill's take on the historical pair of western outlaws who amiably(!) rob banks and trains with their hole-in-the-wall-gang, who soon find themselves wanted men who must flee across the west, taking refuge where they can, and especially with their lady friend Etta Place(Katherine Ross) before they make that fateful trip to Bolivia... Though Paul Newman & Robert Redford are undeniably appealing as the title characters, and the hit song, ""Raindrops keep falling on my head"" is wonderful, film itself is far too protracted and tedious to succeed; it just didn't hold my interest, though both ""Unsolved Mysteries"" & ""In Search Of..."" did excellent jobs focusing on Butch, and whether or not he survived that Bolivian gunfight(no word on Sundance). I'd much rather watch those accounts than this film...  "
130593,tt0092005,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,6,Non-Horror By Stephen King.,"Rob Reiner directed this adaptation of the Stephen King story 'The Body' in this reasonably successful coming-of-age drama about four young 12(or so) year old boys who decide to go searching for a body rumored to be in the woods some miles away, so they walk along the railroad tracks to the area, all the while talking about various things(television, comics, their parents, etc.) while trying to dodge the attentions of the local toughs(led by Kiefer Sutherland) who also want to see the body. When they finally do find it, is where life-long friendships will be forged, bullies faced down, in a time of their lives that they won't soon forget... Wil Wheaton, Corey Feldman, River Phoenix, and Jerry O' Connell are all believable as the four friends, and the script is also realistic, though whether there was so much profanity back then is debatable, and some scenes(like the pie-eating contest) are obnoxious and silly. Framing device with ""The Writer""(Richard Dreyfus) is nice, though not as emotionally cathartic as it believes. Worth watching for the cast and recreation of a specific time and place.  "
133522,tt0052618,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Charlton Heston,"William Wyler directed this Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film about the biblical story of Judah Ben-Hur(played by Charlton Heston in an Academy Award winning best actor performance)who starts out as a rich Jewish prince and merchant, whose childhood friend Messala(played by Stephen Boyd)was recently appointed commander of the Roman Legions. Trouble starts when their political and religious views clash, and after an unfortunate accident in which the Roman governor was almost killed, Messala is forced to send Ben-Hur to the slave-ship galleys, and his mother and sister to prison. Betrayed and enraged, Ben-Hur vows revenge and escape, which he manages, leading to the thundering Chariot race where the grudge will be ended, though he still must find his family... Huge-scale production is magnificently directed and acted, with the climatic chariot race an all-time standout. Does go on quite long, but is still most worthwhile.  "
136309,tt0107290,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Realistic Dinosaurs.,"Based on Michael Crichton's novel, this Steven Spielberg directed Sci-Fi film is grand adventure, though hurt somewhat by a contrived plot, that details how scientists have recreated living dinosaurs from recovered DNA extracted from fossilized Mosquitoes. The park owner John Hammond(played by Richard Attenborough) is oblivious to the dangers, though his guests are not: (Sam Neil as Dr. Grant, Laura Dern as Ellie Sattler, and Jeff Goldblum as Dr. Ian Malcolm). All of them will be proved correct as the security system breaks down, and the dangerous dinosaurs run loose... The CGI F/X are absolutely superb, and still hold up today, so realistic do they portray living dinosaurs that it is terrifying. The acting is also quite good, though the only area the film falls short in is the plot, with the Wayne Knight character being so morally dubious(and stupid!) that he defies belief, but that still doesn't damage this otherwise entertaining film too badly.  "
137021,tt0052311,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,More Than A Touch.,"Orson Welles both directed and costars in this thriller that stars Charlton Heston as Mexican(!) narcotics officer Miguel 'Mike' Vargas, who is on his honeymoon with his wife Susie(played by Janet Leigh) when he is caught up in a murder investigation involving an American businessman who was blown up in his car along the U.S./Mexican border. The crime occurred on the U.S. side, so police captain Hank Quinlan(played by Welles) is in charge. Quinlan proves to be corrupt, and charges an innocent Mexican man with the crime, prompting Vargas to investigate Quinlan's past cases, because he suspects him of being involved with a crime family syndicate he is investigating. This puts not only his life in danger, but Susie's as well... Marlene Dietrich costars as a prophetic night club manager, and Dennis Weaver as a nervous motel manager. Impressively directed film has a good story and characters, though is hurt by the absurd miscasting of Charlton Heston(a fine actor) as a Mexican...I don't think so somehow! Still, the film is well-worth seeing regardless.  "
137241,tt0032551,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,10,A Still Relevant Masterpiece.,"Based on John Steinbeck's novel, this adaptation, brilliantly directed by John Ford, stars Henry Fonda as Tom Joad, who returns to his home after being released from prison on a ""homicide"" charge, discovering that his family is being evicted by the bank, along with everyone else in the area, because this is in the middle of the infamous Oklahoma dust bowl, where a long drought proved devastating. The whole brood gather in their old jalopy to travel(along with many others) to California, where they hear there is work. The family, led by Ma Joad(played by Jane Darwell) endure much tragedy and hardship on the journey, which will end with disappointment upon arrival, though the Joad spirit will continue on... Outstanding film is one of Cinema's true masterpieces, with perfect performances from all, especially Henry Fonda and Jane Darwell, who are unforgettable and entirely believable as much put-upon people who nonetheless endure, though they will have to sadly part ways to do so. Direction by John Ford is highly atmospheric and haunting, and he well-deserved his Academy Award, though the film should have itself won that honor in 1940. The script could not be better, and is still quite moving, truthful and intelligent. It still stands the test of time, and its themes of family unity and hardship amidst exploitation and loss are still relevant today. Not to be missed.  "
138808,tt0120382,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,All Of Life A TV Show?,"Peter Weir directed this comedy-drama that stars Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, a seemingly ordinary and happily married man who lives in a nice town, with a nice job and friends, but grows increasingly suspicious that something is off, and it turns out he's right, as Truman is unknowingly the star of the world's biggest reality TV show, where everything has been scripted since he was a baby, even his family. Once aware of this, Truman tries to find a way out, while the show's creator and director Christof(played by Ed Harris) tries to keep a lid on the situation... Existentialist film works reasonably well, though this idea had been explored before on ""The Twilight Zone"". Still, this is an interesting and thought-provoking film regardless.  "
139368,tt0083987,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,All-Time Great Performance By Ben Kingsly.,"Ben Kingsly plays real life Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi in one of the best performances in screen history, richly deserving his best actor Academy Award, and the film itself won Best Picture, with Richard Attenborough winning best director. Film details how Gandhi went from a young lawyer who leads the campaign for Indian rights in British ruled South Africa after he is shamefully thrown off a train because he wasn't allowed to travel first class(despite his ticket). Later, Gandhi becomes a national hero and leader who calls for India's independence from Great Britain, but who does so by strictly non-violent protest, which amazingly does work for them, since they gain world sympathy due to favorable press coverage. Independence doesn't come without cost, since the divide between Muslims and Hindus is too great, resulting in the formation of Pakistan, and later Gandhi's assassination... Long film is made compelling because of Ben Kingsly's superlative portrayal, and epic sized story telling.  "
140473,tt0075148,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,First Was The Best.,"Sylvester Stallone wrote and stars as Rocky Balboa, small-time Philadelphia boxer, who has a shot at stardom after Heavyweight champion Apollo Creed(Carl Weathers, entertainingly flamboyant performance) decides(as a publicity stunt) to give a local boxer a chance to beat him; only he doesn't count on Rocky taking the fight seriously, and as a consequence, underestimates him. Exciting and well-written drama also has Talia Shire as his shy girlfriend Adrian, Burt Young as her resentful brother Pauley, and Burgess Meredith(unforgettable) as his crusty manager. Epitome of the underdog story, with a rousing finish guaranteed to make you stand up and cheer, aided immeasurably by the soaring score.  "
143571,tt0032138,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Family Favorite,"Based on the L. Frank Baum novel, this classic film(as everyone knows) is about Dorothy Gale(played by Judy Garland) who, along with her little dog Toto, is whisked away from Kansas To Oz by tornado, which ends up killing the wicked witch of the East, enraging her evil sister the wicked witch of the West(played so memorably by Margaret Hamilton) who vows revenge, though her trip to find the wizard(played by Frank Morgan) who can help her also has her meet the Scarecrow(Ray Bolger), the Tin Man(Jack Haley) and Cowardly Lion(played by Bert Lahr) who all become close friends in this strange land of Munchkins, talking trees, and flying monkeys. Wonderful is the word to describe this unforgettable film that overcomes production problems to become the beloved favorite it is. Don't need to be a fan of musicals to enjoy!  "
144016,tt0088247,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Non-Stop Action Sci-Fi.,"Arnold Schwarzenegger was dead-on perfect playing a cyborg assassin sent from the future by machines(who have enslaved humans) to kill Sarah Connor(Linda Hamilton, who has good character development here) who will one day give birth to the leader of the human resistance that will defeat the machines. Michael Bien plays a soldier sent back in time to protect Sarah, but finds himself drawn to her as well. Time is a twisty road though, and the truth was not what either side thought it was... Outstanding film is extremely exciting and taut, with fine F/X, acting and script(not all the ideas are original, but they had never been put on screen so powerfully before.) Writer & director James Cameron made a name for himself with this breathless film, helped by a fantastic music score. A classic!  "
144684,tt0107048,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Over & Over Again,"Harold Ramis directed this inventive comedy that stars Bill Murray as Pittsburgh TV Weatherman Phil Connors, who is a cynical, sarcastic man most resentful about being sent again to cover the annual Groundhog Day festival in Punxatawney Pennsylvania. After spending a joyless day there, he is shocked to learn that it is still the same day(Feb. 2) again. Then again, and again! In fact, no matter what he says or does, he is stuck in a 24 hour time loop that only he knows about. Eventually, Phil starts to change, and becomes determined to win the affection of colleague Rita(played by Andie MacDowell) no matter how long it takes, since Phil has a lot of time on his hands... Wonderful film takes a potentially one-joke premise and constantly finds new things to do with it. Both funny and warm, this really builds up a sense of good will and empathy for Phil, and is also helped by fine supporting performances.  "
146187,tt0073195,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,10,Don't Go In The Ocean...,"Classic film about a killer great white shark loose in a sea side community, and the efforts of the local police chief (Roy Scheider, engaging performance), shark expert(Richard Dreyfuss, also good) and fisherman Quint(Robert Shaw, unforgettable) to track it down and kill it, before the peaceful town of Amity goes bankrupt. Extremely exciting, well constructed thriller has a first-rate script, and of course Steven Spielberg's exemplary direction, pulling a triumph out of a possible disaster(production was much delayed because the mechanical shark malfunctioned) Terrifying and supremely well-crafted thriller is a masterpiece, and kept millions of people out of the ocean for years afterward!  "
146521,tt0036868,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,9,Classic Academy-Award Winner.,"William Wyler won a best directing Academy Award(as did the film itself) for this powerfully told film about three returning veterans from WWII: Al Stephenson(played by Frederic March) who is a banker with a wife(played by Myrna Loy) and daughter(played by Teresa Wright). Fred Derry(played by Dana Andrews)with a wife(played by Virginia Mayo), and Homer Parrish(played by Harold Russell(Academy Award winner) who lost his hands, though still has a loving family and girlfriend(played by Cathy O'Donnell). All three men have various troubles adjusting to civilian life after their war experiences, equal parts emotional, financial, and physical. Their families also struggle reconnecting, since they have changed as well, and not all will stay together... Heartfelt and compelling film was the perfect tonic for post-war audiences at the time, and remains an excellent motion picture today, having lost none of its power to move the viewer. A classic.  "
147700,tt0044079,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,8,Criss/Cross,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this classic thriller that stars Farley Granger as Guy Haines, a professional tennis player who one day meets Bruno Antony(played by Robert Walker) on a train. He is a strange man who ingratiates himself with Guy. They tell each other their problems, and Bruno comes up with a morbid idea: Since the number one problem with getting away with murder is alibi, he proposes that they switch murders, or ""criss/cross"", so that Bruno would murder Guy's wife(they don't love each other anymore) and Guy would murder Bruno's hated father, that way the police would never suspect them, because there is no motive! Guy shrugs this off as fantasy, but Bruno turns out to be quite serious, and plunges Guy into a nightmare he may not be able to get out of... Ingenious premise is very well-handled in this suspenseful and well-acted thriller, with innovative and lively direction, and a smart script that makes the most of its premise. Hair-raising climax in the amusement park tops off this excellent film.  "
155389,tt0046250,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Charming Getaway.,"William Wyler directed this charming comedy that stars Audrey Hepburn(who won an Academy Award for best actress) as Princess Ann, who is touring European countries and while in Rome, gets bored with the routine so impulsively sneaks out on her entourage and slips into a truck, and later falls asleep on a park bench, where she is found by American journalist Joe Bradley(played by Gregory Peck) who later finds out her true identity, and decides to befriend her by giving her a tour of the sights and landmarks, while trying to not fall in love with the lovely young woman... Popular film works as both comedy and romance, handling both with believability and care. A slight film to be sure, but most appealing.  "
155495,tt0058461,AaronCapenBanner,United Kingdom,7,Clint Eastwood Became A Star.,"Clint Eastwood plays a mysterious wandering gunfighter in Sergio Leone's influential western, that made Clint a big star, and created a whole new genre of western. Clint's unnamed character arrives in a virtual ghost town ruled by two rival criminal families, the Baxters and the Rojos, whom he both allies with and betrays in a clever scheme to get them to play off each other, in order that he can profit. Unfortunately, one family gets wise to this, and after wiping the other family out, takes its revenge against Clint, though finds that he doesn't die so easily... Stylishly directed by Leone, and starkly acted by Eastwood, who creates an unforgettable character that he would build on in the two sequels. Film itself is interesting, though ragged, however, things would get better...  "

JJ Abrams did a fantastic job, better than anything Lucas could. Solid cast, action, effects, everything. The Breaking Bad of film. I'm still stuck on deciding which is better between this and The Empire Strikes Back, which speaks for itself. (Hi Lewis) Go see this film, even if you're not a Star Wars fan, because you will become one. I'll definitely be seeing this multiple times, and I cannot wait to see the future of Star Wars in Episodes 9, 10 and the spin off movies. And thankfully, there isn't any Jar Jar Binks or young Anakin Skywalker. Instead we have interesting, diverse and excellently played characters. What a film.  "
79126,tt0066921,aarondevoll,united states,10,Alexander the Great,"Undoubtedly one of the most controversial films of all time, Stanley Kubrick's portrayal of a corrupt and violent future has achieved much praise as a cult film but has been misunderstood by many. The film begins with three brilliant scenes. We discover who the four men are, what their business is and who they stand for but as the film goes on, we learn that these four men don't have much of an agenda, they just find thrill in committing such horrible acts. Alex, the main character and narrator, leads this gang he calls his ""droogs"" through an ordinary night. After raping an author's wife and ravaging their home, Alex retires to his comfortable home where we discover he does appreciate some things in life, such as fine art and animal life. As soon as he plays his favorite musician, we get a brief glimpse of how his mind operates and how naturally he feels the impulses of rape, death and violence. The next day, we meet his mum and dad, both unusual characters yet they stand out for some reason. We learn a little more about Alex, he is an intelligent and well spoken young man, who has seemed to never get himself into any serious trouble. Then he gets into a disagreement with his droogs and gives them a harsh lesson to convince them who their true leader is. The gang plans another fun night by going to a house owned by a feline lover. Alex gets himself into the house, alone and confronts the lady, who is strong and unwilling to be taken advantage of. A fight ensues with both Alex and the cat lady using a symbolic weapon, Alex a phallic statue and the cat lady the head of Beethoven. The cat lady ends up dead in a very memorable scene. As soon as he leaves, the droogs turn on Alex and leave him for the police. This is where the film takes a turn. Alex begins to shift into a different person. We see him reading the bible, indicating he's always had a god-like persona that he wishes to change. Alex agrees to undergo an experimental procedure to make him unable to do any wrong doing at all. Alex then gets an early release from prison and onto a new start. Alex arrives home where he has seemingly been replaced by a lodger. This is where the attitude for Alex has taken a complete shift, the audience now feels they should sympathize for him when they once loved to hate him. After a couple more visits from old friends, Alex unintentionally ends up facing another past victim, the author who's wife Alex brutally raped. Out of hospitality, Alex is fed and clothed but the author then recognizes him and prepares something to exploit his new weaknesses. The Beethoven that Alex used to lust for has been replaced with feelings of pain and sickness. Alex decides to ""snuff it"" out of this cruel and wicked world. But of course it was unsuccessful, obviously as he had been narrating the film all along. We next find him in a hospital bed, he is recovering yet we are not sure if his weaknesses persist. The doctor conducts a test and we learn that some of his past philosophy has returned but how much? The very last scene reveals much more, Alex has most likely returned to his old self. But we are still left with many things to think about. Should we, ourselves be the only ones to make choices, even if we choose to be evil? This film has so many elements that make it memorable, including great characters, ironic use of music, great cinematography and a theme that will stand the test of time. 10/10. This films style is incredible but it is its content that people usually don't see. Several viewings are probably required.  "
125413,tt0469494,aarondevoll,united states,10,"No Blood, No Guts, No Glory","Paul Thomas Anderson began his career as a young filmmaker in the early 90's. He proceeded to make several energetic, ambitious movies which were guided by an upbeat soundtrack. Stylistically, he borrowed from Altman, Mamet and Scorsese but still, his films fit nicely with all of the other fun, stylized Hollywood films made in the 90's along the likes of Tarantino and Kevin Smith. Flash forward to 2005, Anderson has matured quite a bit since his feature length debut in '96. He has more experience under his belt and he has become a father. He's taken a few years off from his last feature, starring Adam Sandler. At this point, Anderson is ready to make something he's never attempted. He jumps into uncharted waters and begins writing a film titled ""There Will Be Blood."" It seems that Anderson was ready to up his game and strived for a picture that was more grand, more metaphysical, similar to his own heroes, Stanley Kubrick and Sidney Lumet. Of course, to make a project as sublime as Anderson had envisioned, he had to team up with some very talented people. The iconic Day Lewis in the lead, underrated Paul Dano in the supporting role, minor characters who look as if they've been pulled from a 1920's black and white photo, a great cinematographer, talented set designers, Jonny Greenwood and an interesting germ of an idea from a novel by Upton Sinclair. When all of these ingredients came together it culminated into one of the greatest films of the 2000's. PTA is the kind of director who admits he isn't always sure what he's ""looking for"" and he hopes the thematic aspects will fall into place as he goes along. Though ""Blood"" is a very ambitious film, PTA handles it with confidence and possibly a willingness to break the mold of what kind of director critics had previously defined him as. Tarantino has recently tried to do the same after making three Los Angeles based films that helped put him on the map, problem is his latest films have become more ""popcorn"" movies that combine Quentin's favorite genres. ""There Will Be Blood"" is a masterful film in nearly every facet. Everyone has acknowledged the acting is great. Daniel Day Lewis is riveting, even in the scenes he doesn't speak. The soundtrack is memorable, the cinematography is special and PTA gets the most out of authentic Texas locations used throughout. And then there's the ending, which feels like it was ghost-directed by the spirit of Kubrick himself. ""Blood"" seems to get better and better the more you watch it. 10/10. To make a film in the caliber of this, the planets have to line up. This involves of course the auteur, whose film should reflect their personal lives. Some great directors have made a ""shift"" into the greatest years of their filmography. It seems with this film that PTA has started his recent journey.  "
129036,tt1130884,Aaron-dwight,united states,8,Twisting Story Line,"The movie Shutter Island is about Teddy Daniels, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, an investigator who is put on an mission to find a patient who has disappeared from the island. Teddy had volunteered to take this mission because he was determined to find and expose his theory that Ashecliffe had been using these patients as lab rats to learn how to control them with drugs and surgery. Teddy begins to have hallucinations of his wife Dolores, played by Michelle Williams, who had been killed in a apartment fire by Andrew Laeddis who was also supposed to be on the island at the hospital as well. When a storm came and shut down all the power on the island the jail cells were all opened and Teddy and his partner Chuck, played by Mark Ruffalo, went into Ward C which is were he thought Laeddis was at. While in there he met George in there which is someone who he had known that originally told him about the secret things going on in that hospital. George told him that Chuck was not really his partner and that all of the doctors were playing a game with him; then went on to tell him that in order to see where they perform the surgeries that he had to go to the lighthouse. Teddy eventually does get to the lighthouse only to find Dr. Cawley, played by Ben Kingsley, who then went on to tell Teddy that he had been at the hospital for two years and that his real name was Andrew Laeddis. He then explained to Teddy that Chuck was not his partner, he was his doctor as well, he just stated with Teddy to make sure that he was safe; and that they allowed him to play the role of an investigator hoping that it would help him to come to the realization that he had actually killed his own wife for killing their children. Although the movie was not scary in any way to gave off a look as if it were, the lighting was very dark in a lot of shots and with some of the camera angles there it looked as if something was about to happen. All of the characters did a great job with the acting, there was a good twist at the end of the movie that would definitely leave you confused. You may even have to watch it more than once to get a full understanding of what was actually going on in the movie from beginning to end.  "

135230,tt0405159,aarongnp,united states,6,Good movie ruined by unbelievability *SPOILERS*,"After leaving the theater last night, I didn't know whether I enjoyed the movie, or had a blah feeling about it. The premise of the movie, on the whole was good. Swank, Eastwood and Freeman all played believable, likable characters. The ""feel"" of the movie wasn't all that different than Mystic River, a lot of washed out colors, and very stark. But like Mystic River, There were points of the movie that were beyond belief, and made me lose feeling for the movie. First off, Swank's family is shallow and clich«∏d. Redneck family, trailer park, teenage sister has a baby, brother just got out of prison, momma is leeching off welfare and when ""Pa"" was alive, he loved his dog. The Rednack Royal Flush. Not only were they clich«∏s, they were totally unlikeable, even as villains. I don't know if this is the overacting, or just the overall shallowness of their character development, but the scenes with them detracted from the film as a whole. Second is the boxing scenes. Now I won't say it wasn't unexpected that she quickly rose through the ranks, as almost every movie involving sports involves the little guy rising to the top (and usually winning), but the scenes where she is fighting are unbelievable on a few levels. I believe most of which has to do with poor direction and camera placement. Almost all of the punches thrown look very obviously like staged punches. I didn't wince when punches were landing, because none of the punches looked like they were landing. It all looked more fake than Walker Texas Ranger. In addition to this, during the boxing scenes in which they showed a significant portion of the crowd, they were usually looking very goofy. I'd sit there and look at how poorly the extras were being directed, and then I'd wonder why I was getting that long of a view at extras with no obvious acting skills. Aside from the Irish folk in her first British fight, the crowd was simply annoying. And much as been said about the final fight, and how it was unbelievable, and that fight would have been called. No doubt. My final note will deal with the hospital scenes. The only part about these that bothered me, was the ""Win One For The Gipper""-ish talks between Swank and Eastwood. ""Bawsss, I won't walk again will I?"" blah blah blah. The scene as a whole was dragged on too long, and with all the media it has gotten about the assisted suicide, I wanted to kill myself by how long it dragged on. So I gave it a 6 out of 10. Get rid of the clich«∏s and unbelievability, and it'd be an 8.  "

Kylo Ren was an underwhelming villain who seemed more like a butthurt kid rather than having the organizational skills of Darth Vader. The other remaining characters - Maz Kanata, Snoke, Hux, and Phasma were all somewhat cool but didn't get enough screen time. Overall the coolest aspects of the film were seeing the old characters and Starkiller base, I also loved the comedy but that's small stuff. Overall this should have been more of a J. J.

It felt like I was really in space, but also all alone and running from something that I didn't know. I felt like every moment was suspenseful as the last moment. That every thing led to another. Aliens a movie that shows that curiosity just doesn't kill the cat it also kills us. That being all alone in a spaceship isn't all cracked up as it seems.

17237,tt0137523,aaronhweiss,united states,10,Masterpiece," From the astonishing visual style, to its stinging satire of American culture, never has a movie made me laugh so hard, or drew me in so completely. It is said that every generation has a work of art or an artist that represents the feeling and conflicts of its time. Fight Club is just such a movie. Although considered to be a statement on the impoverishment of white American males, Fight Club is just as important as any piece of art trying to portray the sufferings and ailments of a society, culture, or demographic. Critics who dismiss the movie as some type of attempt to portray white males as having problems that they just should not complain about, simply refuse to be open to the fact that everyone has problems, and issues that need to be faced. Fight Club illustrates the issues of its generation with great clarity. It is not a matter of agreeing with the issues. It is a matter of resolving the problems. Some of the themes in the movie such as consumerism, loneliness and nihilism only serve to illustrate the ""lost"" X generation, and are only means to illustrating a dead and lifeless society. What is great about this movie is it does not provide all the answers.   "

But this movie isn't about the holocaust, it's about a man trying to keep the horrors of it from his young boy, and trying to live through it as best he can. Any one who says that that is an insult to the six million who died, I suspect those six million may be smiling now, thinking that someone had the guts to dare express love in such a horrible situation, to successfully protect his son.

Even the places have stupid sounding names some sound like they were ripped off too.

20996,tt0120737,aaronjustice,united states,10,"An epic start to an epic trilogy, the hype delivers"," This summarizes my complaints of the entire movie. 1.

The battle in Moria is WAY too shaky, although I've noticed special effects and the focus of movies is a million times clearer on video compared to blurry, light projected movie film. 3. The climax with Balrog marks a climatic ending, but the movie continues for another 40 minutes. Other than that, I have no complaints. Who cares if they cut out the scene with Tom Bombadil? Not me. Any person who owns a horse named Fatty Lumpkin deserves to be left out of the movie. Yes, I have read the book, and I read it thoroughly. I am very well aware of the Christian allegory written in the story, and I feel pretty certain I understand it much better than most of you do, being a Christian and all. The opening of the movie is symbolic of Satan's war against heaven, the elves are angels and the orcs are demons. Gandalf is the representation of Jesus, and Saruman is Lucifer, the angel that became Satan through betrayal. I saw the movie with three of my friends, two of them never read the book. All four of us left agreeing that it is the best movie we have seen in a long time if not ever. Some people may complain about lackluster special effects in some areas. I did notice them too. However, I thought the Mummy Returns had the worst special effects I've seen in a while, but when I bought the DVD, the effects looked much better than I remember. (However, nothing could fix the hideous Scorpion King). Once it is out on video (New Line cinema promised it by August) I'm sure the effects will look much better. I can't wait until next year, the Two Towers is probably going to be even better.  "
131681,tt1392190,aaronkalat,united states,10,The best action film since Terminator 2.,"Right out of the gate this film fires all 8 cylinders and never lets up. The film is pretty much one large chase scene, and while that sounds terrible on paper it works incredibly well. The style of directing here is unique in that there isn't much exposition dialog at all. Everything you need to know is presented in small doses as needed to advance the story. The film does exactly what a film should do and that's show, don't tell. You need not see the previous films to understand who Max is, or why he does what he does. The film is absolutely gorgeous. Most post-apocalyptic films are bleak and dreary but this film breaks the mold. For those not familiar with post-processing film techniques, it's as if the entire film has been ""instagrammed"". Because this film has little exposition through dialog the look of the film says it all. One of the most impressive pieces is when they show the inside of a dust storm, that's all I'll say about that. The sound design is flawless. You feel every bullet, shake with every explosion, and are brought to near tears by the soundtrack. There is also a very unique presentation to some of the tracks as the war parade has musicians acting as war drummers and ""trumpet"" players on the front lines. I'm reminded of how TASM 2 used dubstep during the showdown with Electro, but this time the incorporation is actually good. The film is ridiculous on so many levels in the best kind of way. The man playing the electric guitar that shoots fire out is nothing short of lovable. You actually feel like you are on the front lines of an all out war with war drummers and said electric guitar man being the driving force behind the energy. The war boys are wicked cool and their belief system gives inspiration to their absolute madness. Their leader is utterly terrifying. Everything from his voice to his armor to his inability to feel true fear helps elevate this villain to the top 10 list. The amount of detail presented in every shot is breathtaking. You really get the feeling that this is the film the director wanted to create for the last 30 years but because of budget concerns he was never able to. The fact that this film was in development hell for so long is usually a clear sign of a destined failure (see Duke Nukem Forever), but here it payed off. The acting is spot on. Max is still a man of few words and Furiosa is the perfect teammate. If you had to create a team of badasses you would pick Furiosa and Max. Their chemistry is brilliant. It's not forced at all. You know they need each other to survive and when they work together great things happen. I was a little nervous when the first 30 minutes of the film contained Michael Bay levels of madness. I thought ""well, there's only one way to go from here"". I can safely say I assumed wrong. The director has more than enough fireworks to last the entire run time. The finale is absolute madness. It's not just people killing one another so survive, it's about redemption for multiple characters. This was their last chance to make things right and you felt everything we have witnessed was nothing compared to what was to come. The delivery was so action packed I couldn't believe what I was seeing. It's hard to find flaws in this film. Sure, we can nitpick little things but honestly, I would need to study the DVD/Bluray with a microscope to find them. If you like action films you owe it yourself to buy a ticket for this.  "

7584,tt0468569,aaron-krenz,united states,10,Amazingly Correct,"OK, we have all read the reviews, seen all the hype over the past year about how this movie was going to change everything in the world of Batman. Amazingly, though not changed, this movie has lived up to EVERY expectation and then some. Though a very long movie (with credits and whatnot it was 2hrs 47mins at my theater), I never once felt like it was running long or dragging in any spot during the film. Christian Bale played a great Batman (again) and helped the story along with his childhood pains and wish to help the public. He did, however, fail in one aspect... the Batman voice ! Can someone toss him a Sucret or a Halls cough drop or something ? Though not a huge flaw or one that brings down the movie, there are a couple scenes where you cannot help but think ""Come on man !!"" Aaron Eckhart played a tremendous Harvey Dent / Two Face and, to me, he was very believable and darn near perfect. The pain of having life stripped from you and being disfigured in the process seeps through and, though technically a villain, you can sympathize with him and almost feel sorry for him when it comes to his actions in the latter half of the movie. Now, as for Heath Ledger... wow ! I am trying to not let the ""he is dead now"" buzz leave notions and feelings about his role in my head.. with that said, I can not really review his performance without over-using the words ""perfect"", ""extraordinary"", and ""amazing"". It simply was all those things and so much more. We all grew up with the Joker being an evil prankster but he took the Joker and made him something far more and far more ruthless and maniacal. There really is no ""summing"" it up, you just have to watch it. All things said, just watch the movie... if you like Batman or just action movies in general, you will NOT be disappointed. "

The visual style is phenomenal, more watchable than most big budget films. But it's the enthralling story and incredible acting that truly makes this film legendary. So much authenticity has been seen in the best films in history. The legendary dark knight is not portrayed as a hero, but almost as an antihero. This film is dark, and takes risks that were actually rather shocking. Not really for kids in my opinion, but a film for moviegoers in general. The acting is uncanny. Christian Bale makes the perfect Batman, and he has transformed him into an iconic character. He is one of the best, most powerful actors and is one of my personal favorites. Michael Cain was phenomenal, as well as Morgan Freeman. Gary Oldman is a legendary actor and is great as Commissioner Gordon. Maggie Gyllenhaal is a great actress, and adds some fire to her role as Rachel. Heath Ledger was shocking. Legendary Jack Nicholson played the Joker almost 20 years earlier, but Heath Ledger gave a more authentic, interesting, and memorable performance, surpassing Nicholson... that is unheard of! His portrayal of The Joker was haunting. He well deserved the Oscar, and his performance will go down as one of the greatest in film history.

The direction, the writing, the acting... all superb. It captivates, disturbs, and fascinates the viewer. This is a film that plays on the senses; on fear, on imagination, and on emotions. The director's visual style paints a dark, bleak, yet colorful world that depicts the ugly side of humanity. The story itself is phenomenal. It is intriguing, unsettling, and is told so effectively. The cast is its strongest point. They are what make this film unforgettable. Anthony Hopkins is a powerhouse in this film, dominating the role of Hannibal Lecter, with his leering stare and his creepy demeanor.Yet there's a charm and wit that draws you in. You forget that he's a psychopathic killer. Jodie Foster is incredible. She gives her character so much depth. She disappears in her role with her subtle mixture of strength and vulnerability. Ted Levine deserves more recognition for his role as serial killer Buffalo Bill. He is so disturbing and appalling in this film. He gives a chilling performance. The scenes with Foster and Hopkins are undeniably the strength of this movie. Hopkins picks away at Foster's inner demons, forcing her to open up her troubling past. In exchange, he reveals more and more information on the identity of a notorious serial killer. Foster's desperation does nothing to budge Hopkins from his request, and her vulnerability is more and more present as their scenes progress. They are both remarkable in this movie. I highly recommend this classic if you've never seen it. It hasn't aged at all, in my opinion. The failed attempts at cinema today make this film even stronger today than it was in 1991. It is truly a masterpiece.  "
79846,tt0075314,aaronlmadden,united states,10,Possibly the best character bio of all time,"The film was released when the darkness of our culture began creeping into the theater. Movies were more raw, authentic and made a huge impact on audiences. Many of them made strong cultural and political statements. More young filmmakers were stepping out of traditional techniques and adding their own unique, artistic vision of style. Among these was Martin Scorsese, who has now become one of the most powerful directors of all time. And his successful career took off in 1976 with the release of a masterpiece... Taxi Driver. This is a near perfect film, held together by intriguing story, brilliant direction, and perfect acting. Shot almost like a documentary, the film is entirely in the main characters perspective. With Paul Schrader's structure, every line has a meaning, every shot has a purpose, all adding to the story. The almost dreamlike sequences make you question whether or not what you are seeing is really happening. This film will make you realize the impact the vision of a great director can have on a film. Robert De Niro gives one of the most realistic, most haunting performances in film history. The character of Travis Bickle was portrayed with such subtle authenticity. He fully inherited the character, mentally and physically altering himself for the role. He didn't have to act... he was Travis Bickle. He adds so much to the character that makes this movie unforgettable. His famous quirky monologues add a touch of humor to the film, but are also quite disturbing and effective. There's a reason Robert De Niro is dubbed as one of the greatest actors of all time, and his performance in Taxi Driver is that reason. This film may not be for everyone. Many viewers may find it hard to relate to the character of Travis Bickle. He is the ultimate antihero. But if you like like well made, character driven films, this is a classic that is just as strong today, if not stronger, than it was when it was released in 1976. I highly recommend this film.  "
125672,tt0469494,aaronlmadden,united states,9,powerful and memorable,"This film will go down as one of the greatest in cinema history. The story of an over ambitious oil man is told so effectively by the talented mind of director Paul Thomas Anderson. He draws us in with his eccentric style and holds our attention until the very end. The movie is brilliantly made, and quite unlike anything I have ever seen. The cinematography is stunning; the sights, sounds, and the epic scope of this movie are breathtaking. The acting in this film is on a whole other level than almost any other film in my opinion. All the cast give amazing performances. But Daniel Day Lewis... there are no words to describe him. He completely disappears in this role. His mere presence in the film is unsettling. But his intense performance works because of its subtly. He doesn't have to forwardly express his hatred and anger often for you to believe him. He inhabits these traits so perfectly you can just sense it. This is no doubt one of the best performances of all time. And personally one of my favorites. This is an instant classic. I strongly recommend it.  "
99130,tt0071315,aaronlromano,united states,10,A Cinematic Slug to the Gut,"Of the films this reviewer has seen (and that is quite a lot) this film is one of the select few to come as near to cinematic excellence as possible. From the first shot to the infamous final line, you belong to Polanski; in his hands for the whole ride - and those hands, I think it safe to say, are the hands of a master. The film features a phenomenal cast with Jack Nicholson as Jake Gittes, the beautiful Faye Dunaway as femme fatale Evelyn Mulwray and the excellent director John Huston in an acting role as one of the most horrifying villains in the history of cinema: Noah Cross. Now this is one of those films where little of the plot can be revealed because it's all just far too complicated BUT it's also a film you aren't likely to ever forget. Ever. With beautiful cinematography, a heart- pounding story line, fantastic acting and one of the most atrociously heart-rending finales this reviewer has ever seen, this film is an absolute must. My rating 10/10  "
128504,tt0074958,aaronlromano,united states,8,A Fierce and Searing Media Satire,"Perhaps one of the most brilliant works of satire to appear since Voltaire's Candide, this film points a damning finger at the treachery of the television industry. Faye Dunaway stars in her fabulous Oscar- winning performance as Diana, a calculating TV exec who's only concern is ratings, ratings, ratings who, without any consideration, exploits a hapless news anchor suffering from a mental breakdown. The film features a variety of other stunning performances, two of which rightfully received Oscars, as a variety of excellently painted characters. While also managing to be blackly funny, this film also shows the vastly negative effects of television on the human condition, most accurately defined in one the film's many classic lines: ""Television is not the truth! Television is a Goddamned amusement park!"" But the true brilliance of the film is the fact that in spite of the film being sternly rooted in the 70s era, it is still relevant today - perhaps even more so as corporation conglomerates continue to gobble up all that we know. But the thing to remember is: While yes it is satire and it is far more over-the-top than real life, it carries with it a striking message. It carries with it the message that television is bad, plain and simple, a fact that now more than ever we need to be reminded of. This film very well hits the mark it aims for and while it does suffer at times from being hilariously unbelievable, this too allows it to hit it's mark. In short, this is a fine film - but be careful, it may have you screaming: ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!"". My rating 8/10  "
146805,tt0072684,aaronlromano,united states,10,A Grossly Unacknowledged Masterpiece,"Having been a great fan of Kubrick's meager but stunning output (it's quality, not quantity) I of course resolved to see all of his films. Barry Lyndon was one that I had not heard of before and from inquiries, found that few people had heard of it either. Not knowing it that was I good or bad thing, I picked up the film and gave it a watch. What I found was one of the few films I have ever given a perfect rank. The film grants sumptuous viewing from start to finish with perfectly framed and elegant shots, stunning costumes and fine acting. Know that this is not like any other Kubrick (which is partly why I believe it's relatively looked over), but that his trademark brilliance is there. His perfectionism permeates the film and of course creates the only possible outcome - something perfect. In spite of none of the characters being necessarily likable (there are anti-heroes and villains abound) they resonate greatly, bringing much emotion to the film. The scenery also is beautiful; even in the film's slowest moments one can not pull one's eyes from the screen. Kubrick has certainly created a work of brilliance in this one and it may perhaps be one of his best films. If you do enjoy Kubrick's body of work, be sure and find yourself a copy. You will not regret it. 10/10.  "
70999,tt0364569,AaronLYM,Malaysia,10,Thought Provoking Masterpiece...,"This movie is just simply mind-blowing. I think this is one of the most unique stories I've ever come across. This movie kept me guessing right from the start, and I was shocked to learn about the truth myself. Choi Min-Sik is absolutely brilliant and delivers an Oscar worthy performance in my opinion. Some parts of this movie can be rather bloody and violent, but overall it resonates with the whole story and help to emphasize on the main character's development. The fighting scene where Dae-su goes on a rampage with a hammer and his bare fists is really well shot and truly memorable. Although the movie mainly touches on vengeance and tragic experiences, it really gave me a mental impact and it is not one that I will ever forget. I've always thought that rumors are nothing if someone just ignores them. However in this case, simple comments can just be blown out of proportion and made into dangerous rumors. Once the rumors go viral, there's no way to know how much damage it can cause to people. It might seem like nothing to someone, but it can mean everything to someone else. This movie really made me think how crucial it is to keep things discreet. Some things can be said or shared with others, while some are better left unsaid. Things can be told in one way, but after being spread to different parties, it tends to deviate from the original source. I really feel sorry for Dae-su, because he never knew the little story he shared with his friend will one day come back to haunt him in such a tragic way. Even though he told his friend to keep it discreet, his friend still blabbered about it and spread the word unknowingly. That's why I think it's extremely important to choose what to say and who to share information with. This movie has sparked a remake from Hollywood last year since it's first release 10 plus years ago. I have yet to watch the remake, but I believe the original will stand the test of time and remain as one of the best movies ever made.  "
87189,tt0361748,AaronLYM,Malaysia,9,One hell of a joyride in an alternate World War II scenario...,"This movie is 2.5 hours long, and I enjoyed every second of it. The movie is shown as five chapters, which gets more and more interesting along the way. It's filled with brilliant acting, great dialogs, action, bloody violence and suspense. The opening scene is straight out gripping and acted marvelously by Christoph Waltz, who won an Oscar for his performance. His character displays a certain gentleman like charm, which can change instantly to be real evil and menacing if provoked. His calmness and unpredictable behavior really gives me the creeps. Brad Pitt also gives a great performance as the leader of The Basterds. I find the characters of Hans and Aldo to be similar in some ways. Both are leaders of their respective groups; both are equally famous and have earned nicknames; both are highly intelligent, responsible and ruthless in carrying out duties. The rest of the cast also put on great performances, grounding the movie in an alternate World War II reality. If you're looking for a thrill ride, pure excitement, bloody action and a sweet taste of revenge, this is a great movie to be indulged with. I was totally satisfied.  "
16,tt0111161,aaronmaclellan,canada,10,Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time,"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.  It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity.   It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.  And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery.   Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different.   If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.  An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10. "
39452,tt0245429,aaronmfisher,united kingdom,10,Finest Animated Feature Ever!," I first heard of this movie back in April this year, and saw it's release on R1 DVD, but I wasn't interested in it then, but in Castle in the Sky which was released at the same time. Months went by until September, and then the trailer for Sen appeared in my local Cardiff UGC, which looked very weird but which kindled my interest, and when it finally came out I took the opportunity to see it. And am I glad I did. This is a film that grows on you, by which I mean that I saw it a total of five times before it ended in theatres here, and each time it grew on me, until by the fourth time I was OBSESSED with its wonderful characters and animation and BRILLIANT and CAPTIVATING story. When it went away from my UGC, I wanted to see it again so much I placed my very first R1 DVD order just to get Sen from the States, which I now wish I had done when I first saw the advert in April - take the chance on something I heard was an Oscar winner but which I hadn't seen before. Spirited Away (Sen) deserves 10/10, and it's gotten that from me. The only thing that disgusts me is that not enough promotion of the film was done in the UK, because apart from the trailer, Sen only played in a handful of UK cinemas for only three weeks or so - and each time I went, there were no more than a dozen people there. Criminal, considering the classic must-see status of this fine feature, what I consider to be Miyazaki-San's Magnum Opus.   "

The dvd of Apocalypse Now had arrive the previous day and I decided to crack open a beer and watch it from bed. It seemed a little strange at first, but soon, I was transplanted to another world and taken on one of the most amazing journies I've ever seen in the movies. I has tired, and may have drifted in and out of sleep for a few seconds here and there, and very slightly drunk by the end of the movie, but it was simply amazing. This is the way to watch Apocalypse Now. Don't watch it when you're 100% lucid, watch it when you're out of it a little. That makes the transcendance and feel of being taken to a far off place so much more impressive. I suggest you stay up all night on a Friday and at about 3 or 4 am, put this disc in.

The warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red is what make this movie so great. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. The redemption and friendship theme of this movie is what makes it easy for us all to easily identify with these characters and evoke such emotions while we watch for the first time or the 20th + times you see it Like myself.

Mankind has this basic savage/evil nature and it just may be possible that we can't live without it. Humans advance and evolve but we always have those basic primitive qualities. That's my interpretation of the film anyway, what's yours? Oh, and why do you guys treat those who didn't like the film so badly?

Inside the Labyrinth she meets a Faun (Pan) who tells her that she is a princess and must complete 3 tasks to return to her underground palace. But there is something unsettling about the faun. Meanwhile her pregnant mother is very ill, and her stepfather is an evil war captain. The brilliant part about this movie is that there are two plots. The one plot is the fantasy one of the girl's imagination and the magical underworld and another ""Real World"" Plot is about an ongoing War.

It really entangled me early on and presented a very gripping story combining all the best aspects like humor and suspense and even a twisted fear and horror represented in accidents with the electric chair. This was an outstanding production from beginning to end. The scene with Edgecomb and Coffey in the jail cell prior to Coffey's execution was particularly poignant and really made significant connections to the overall message and intent of the movie.

The film has been slated by many people and it is a film so opinions will be thrown around. Many people do not seem to get the points in this film, such as why bane wants to destroy Gotham, what the film was about in general and many more. I saw this film as an emotional and physical struggle for both Bruce and batman. The film matches the title as both have to rise and protect Gotham (cheesy but hey). Bane wants to carry on the work of Ra's and destroy Gotham. Which fits in well with begins. Selina gives her storm coming speech and talks about basically how the rich have it all and the poor have so little. Seems that Bane manipulates the situation by becoming a kind of leader to the poorer criminal types and leads them against Gotham. Just a few points not a lot of detail but its a film that has a few twists, great fights, drama and does the batman films justice. Rather than think to much about it and compare it to the last...Don't. It is a different kind of film than the last one and gives batman a great send off. So all in all a great film...Getting the trilogy on DVD for sure.  "

Almost every frame of this brooding, beautiful film is to be treasured. First-time filmmakers should take notes - this is easily one of the most ambitious and original debut feature films I've seen in a long time. For those exhausted with the cliches of the hackneyed time-travelling sub-genre, take courage. Richard Kelly crafts a meditation on the nature and time (and ultimately, what it means to be human) from this strange tale of teenaged, suburban malaise. The cast is uniformly excellent, particularly Jake Gylenhaal, whose Donnie Darko is a quietly smouldering adolescent inferno. As his dementia unfolds towards a casually messianic end, he discovers the redemptive properties of time travel, and the painful but exquisite beauty of a teenaged wasteland. Do yourself a favour and see this. For all of its narrative puzzles and headtrip stylistic flourishes, you won't be disappointed. Nor will you see a more original American film all year. Weird and absolutely glorious.  "

The crushing wight of expectation on this franchise pretty much broke George L, so with that in mind, I think that he did a very good job along with all the cast and Crew, to tell a new refreshing story that both involved characters that we have loved for many years and the force. Those who are true Star Wars fans don't need any more explain about the nature of the force. So as I watched and delved into the ever so subtle art form of relaying the nature of the force and the feelings that are contained within it. I was actually blown away by just how much story telling was going on in the subtext. To be able to bring back that 80s feel good action to a modern audience that is constantly bombarded with serious comic shmack, was simply refreshing. Would I have liked to know more back-story? Yes. Were there parts that I didn't quite like? Yes. Did I smile and enjoy this movie? Yes. We're the effects mind blowing? Yes. Did it copy the E04? Kinda From a creators point of view, I would say that this would have been a very hard project to work on considering the backlash that will happen because no one will be completely satisfied with any attempt by a film maker... There will always be something wrong. But I believe that TFA is actually a very good start to a three part story where will be able over the next few years to fall in love with new characters in this unforgettable and incredible franchise.

95439,tt1049413,aaronw915,united states,8,An amusing and unusual group of adventurers,"In the beginning of the animated film, Up, we are introduced to two young, enthusiastic and very different children who share a passion for traveling and their hero, renowned traveler and explorer Charles Muntz. This connection leads Carl Fredricksen, voiced by Ed Asner, and Ellie to become best friends as well as husband and wife. Their passion for travel never abates and they spend their life saving money to travel to Paradise Falls. Unfortunately, as it often does, life gets in the way and their dream is never reached. Fast forward many years and we find an old, stubborn, grouchy Carl as the world has changed rapidly and left him disgruntled and refusing to change with it, reminiscent of Walter Mathau and Jack Lemmon in Grumpier Old Men. Refusing to sell his house he mistakenly causes harm to someone, which gets him in trouble with the law and he is forced to live in a retirement community. Refusing to let this get in his way, he manages to inflate thousands of balloons tied to his house, which causes his how to rise up and float away. His destination: Paradise Falls. It's at this point that the theme of the movie really begins to pick up: no matter what happens, life goes on and you should enjoy every minute of it because you don't know what will happen next. While flying to Paradise Falls, he hears a knock on his door, and unbeknownst to him, a local member of the ""Wilderness Explorers"", Russell has accidentally been brought along. Having no choice but to bring Russell along, he navigates them safely through a massive thunderstorm and almost arrived at his destination. Many balloons were lost in the storm and although still floating, it is not able to fly at high altitudes so Carl and Russell must drag the house to its final location. On the trek across the mountainous terrain Carl and Russell encounter an exotic bird and a talking dog that is trying to capture the bird and return it to his master. During this trip the exotic bird runs away because they encounter many other talking dogs and they are escorted to a remote cave where Carl is united with his idol, Charles Muntz, who has spent the better part of his life searching for the elusive exotic bird that has befriend the group. Upon learning this Carl finally shows some emotion and spends the remainder of the film trying to prevent Charles from harming the bird. This film used amazing computer graphics and enhanced colors to bring a mesmerizing setting to the viewer's eye. The focal point of this movie was the balloons that Carl used to float his house away and you can tell special attention was given to the creation and design to create an impressive display on the screen. The vividness they used also translated into Carl and his grumpy face and the transformation he goes through and without this superior artwork, they would have been unable to truly capture the essence of Up and the central theme of the film of how life goes on and to not waste a minute of it.

The film is violent for sure, but the story is thrilling, unpredictable, but yet you wanted the good to win in the end. I personally found this movie more exciting and interesting than Mystic River which has a similar bad cop good cop theme.

The majority of the movie revolves around the life and career of a newspaper editor/owner if that doesn't give you pause nothing will. What's next?-a 3 hour bio of a CPA or the long arduous tale of the life of an insurance claims adjuster. I can honestly say almost nothing in life befuddles me as much as the praise of this movie (O.K. maybe Jackson Pollock's craptacular paintings, but this movie is up there). Every scene in this movie that is supposed to be dramatic and exciting inspires a so-what kind of response.

The film starts out auspiciously and kind of sneaks up on you. Then it slowly builds up the dramatic intensity until it really consumes you. Everything about the movie is done right.

I never saw him in anything but commercials before this and I have to admit it was pretty weird to see him in a movie like this. The thing that makes this one great is the claustrophobic feeling and the special effects; they are just plain crazy. Carpenter must have had some help from Mary Jane on this one. It does have one of the stupidest moments in horror movie history in it though. The blood screams when he touches it with the hot copper wire? Umm how?!? My god that was brilliantly stupid.

24823,tt1375666,aaropender,united states,6,"Overrated, but Better than Most of Hollywood","First of all, a pet peeve of mine is to read reviews that give away more about a movie than they should. I will not do this here. At the time of the writing of this review, IMDb's overall or average user rating was 9.1. This is most likely among the highest of all movies ever reviewed on this site. Before I paid theater prices (which are just generally too high) to see this film on or shortly after its opening weekend, I checked the user reviews posted here; which I remember as being very positive then, as well. Much is made, in many of the reviews, about the plot twists and plot layers. It is true that the film contains deep plot layering and a few sharp twists, along with some pretty cool CG and 'slow-mo' animations. The problem is that these are essentially all that the movie has going for it. The underlying plot is not compelling. It is comprised, ultimately and fundamentally, of a science fiction technique for one or more trained people to enter the dreams of another, after all involved go to sleep. Each person involved in the 'dream-walking' process, including the person whose dream the others are entering, must have some idea, before sleeping, of what is about to happen. There are briefcase-sized machines involved which must be hooked up to every person who wishes to 'share' the dream. (None of this spoils any of the plot's fulcrums; this is all simply underlying premise, those things on which the plot fulcrums depend.) The above premise is the only original idea of the film. After that, it's just another action movie with a little bit of psychology thrown in. It attempts to be a psychological thriller, but it's more of a psychological action film. The basic premise is not compelling; and the plot twists and layers, which are supposed to be the parts of the movie which 'wow' viewers (and which most of the reviews actually seem to be impressed with), are neither all that original nor imaginative. The ideas behind the layers and twists are fairly commonplace, considering many thriller or psychological type films that have been made and released over the past few decades. Christopher Nolan has, in my opinion, through films made prior to ""Inception"", made a place for himself among the more original and capable film directors. The first movie of his that I saw was ""Memento"". I think the only others of his that I have seen (before ""Inception"") were ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"", and ""The Dark Knight"". Each of these is a very good - or great - movie. ""Memento"" gives viewers a fair idea of the kind of plot layering and twisting that Nolan is trying to accomplish in ""Inception"". ""Memento"" uses a rather original and compelling storytelling device. Upon this the film rests, and upon this the film succeeds. The plot of ""Inception"" rests upon this technique for entering dreams. This is not that compelling; and the ideas, layers, and twists placed upon this premise are not enough to pull it into the land of storytelling greatness of ""Memento"". They are not enough to give it the appeal or draw of the plot of the great ""The Dark Knight"", which constantly had viewers concerned for the citizens of its setting; and which caused viewers to always wonder what horrible, deadly scheme the story's antagonist was going to pull the protagonist into. ""Inception"" is a movie that is no better than most other action movies with a psychological bent. The layers DO require a person to devote full attention to follow. The many plot elements also call for viewers to have a modicum of intelligence or a bit of learning in psychological or consciousness theory. Without these things, a viewer will not truly appreciate what is going on, and will be left to trying to enjoy the action and special effects. Perhaps because it demands viewers' attention and thought, the movie is better than most products from Hollywood. I suspect that it is due to these demands of the film that it has been rated so highly by so many IMDb reviewers. It must be better than at least 60 or 70 percent of Hollywood's garbage - most of which which I have deliberately missed, and against which I am mostly unable to compare ""Inception""; but that doesn't make it a great or ""perfect"" film. In this way, the movie is almost certainly better than MOST Hollywood products. However, likely due to their points of comparison, IMDb reviewers have provided this film with a rating that is so high as to be inaccurate and misleading. It is, in the broadest land of Hollywood, above average. It is NOT good or great, or anything above those levels. Save your money and DO NOT watch this at a full-price theater, unless you're just so steeped in material possession that you simply don't care about $8-10 or more per ticket. It is much easier to appreciate this movie as part of a Netflix queue, or at the cost of a Redbox rental - especially with a setup that will do full justice to some of the cool CG ... though, frankly, pretty much everything from Hollywood is full of cool CG these days. Ultimately, Nolan will be remembered for ""The Dark Knight"", ""Memento"", and perhaps for future films; but not for ""Inception"". Over time, ""Inception"" will fall from the minds of film viewers, though it seems to hold a place at the forefront right now. Hopefully, he returns to form. I expect him to.  "

This was such an amazing movie, it started off a bit slow but picked up well and was emotional and epic. Han Solo's death was extremely moving, after watching his character from the beginning it was sad to see him go. Kylo Ren was quite impressive with mask but was a bit of a disappointment without the mask on. Every time I listen to the music that was played in the final scene I get so moved. The characters were well played by the actors. Luke Skywalker at the end was unbelievable! I was speechless and rightfully so, it was such a memorable scene, the music really hit the spot.

66781,tt1345836,aasimyahya,united states,10,Explains the purpose of the review.,"Amazing! This movie displays a level of exceptional well direction by the one-of-a-kind Christopher Nolan. This movie displays and results in showing an action and thrilling adventure story portrayed in the direction, acting, and production of the entire cast. This displays their extreme dedication to the progression and conclusion to the end of this incredible trilogy. Christian Bale, the incredible Dark Knight Batman with his deep voice-the man behind the mask shows he is no ordinary actor displaying amazing emotions. Tom Hardy may not have the talent to capture the emotions of Heath Legder as the incredible Joker, but also displays incredible skills in his acting as the evil Bane. The, talent of Catwomen, Anne Hathaway is well displayed playing both the romantic interest of Batman/wealthy Bruce Wanye and a disturbed young women attracted to the shadows of the dark and evil world alongside main villain Bane. Both the main cast and the supporting cast have done and incredible job. A supporting actor who stood out in his role was Gary Oldman. In his repeated role coming back for the end of the trilogy he display exceptional acting skill and talent to the movie screen. In conclusion this is a great and amazing movie which will be considered one of best of 2012 if not so the best. 10 of 10 should tell you enough, Grab your cape and your mask and go see the end of the gripping trilogy-The Dark Knight Rises!

The following may contain SPOILERS. Of the scenes that i loved the most included; 1. The Gringotts scene which I thought was very well shot and was built and directed in a very good format. 2. Mostly all the scenes at Hogwarts and the murder of Voldermart were very well written and directed. To be more specific the scenes in that which included a lot of thought and also included a lot of stlye which i enjoyed. To give it a more overview i REALLY enjoyed this part of the the 8 part movie seiries and proves to be the the best on e out of all of them. The acting by Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint, Emma Waston, Ralph Finnes, and the entire cast was truly amazing. This shows how mature and experienced the actors are. You have to watch this movie; and if you don't you are missing a great story . The only thing is fails to live up to is it's even more amazing novel by JK Rowling which will always be the best.  "
96649,tt0041959,aaskillz69,united states,10,"Some of the best of the 40's, and of All Time.","So a re-watch, and i was very interested in seeing this one again, because this is considered to be a masterpiece, and i actually found it overrated the first time i saw it, but i remember being very tired and not in a good mood when i first saw this, so that probably affected the way i saw the movie, and that was why i felt like i needed to re-watch this, after i had long seen this movie. The Third Man is directed by Carol Reed and it stars Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Bernard Lee and Trevor Howard. And i got to say that unsurprisingly my opinion has changed, the thing is that it changed much more than i though it would, because this is quite something. An out of work pulp fiction novelist, Holly Martins, arrives in a post war Vienna divided into sectors by the victorious allies, and where a shortage of supplies has lead to a flourishing black market. He arrives at the invitation of an ex-school friend, Harry Lime, who has offered him a job, only to discover that Lime has recently died in a peculiar traffic accident. From talking to Lime's friends and associates Martins soon notices that some of the stories are inconsistent, and determines to discover what really happened to Harry Lime. The Third Man is almost a perfect Noir, although not the column one, a man trying to find the truth, he sees himself dealing with criminals, he sees himself in love, he is completely confused and Joseph Cotten shows that perfectly on screen. And its funny to think that this 64 year old movie, actually had me in the edge of my seat, not knowing what was going to happen, quite a few times. The movie's power is enlarged by some AMAZING cinematography, The Third Man, might have the best cinematography i have seen from a movie that was made in the first half of the century. Most of the movie is shot in some peculiar angles, the shadows are amazingly beautiful, the cinematography adds A LOT to the movie, we feel this gloomy feeling on the air, it truly captures the devastated Europe after WW2. Quite weird to see that Robert Krasker only got this Academy Award win and nomination, because he shows here some very impressive work. Another two great technical things that the movies has, is its score by Anton Karas and its editing by Oswald Hafenrichter, both very impressive worthy of AT least a nomination. Then we get to the performances, and Joseph Cotten is the star of the movie, to say that Orson Wells is the star, would be very unfair to Cotten who does here some of the best work of his career, quite sad to see that such a good and charming actor never got any recognition. Alida Valli, is probably more known for some foreign language movies, but this one is by far the best English movie she did, she great in the movie, she does not play the usual girl that was in almost every movie made at this time. She proves that in the end of the movie, and what an ending. Orson Wells is undeniably great, as the charming manipulative villain, but the thing is that, i felt like he was not enough on the movie, i mean the plot is about this character, but just has 15 minutes of screen time, but he is great in every single minute. Carol Reed does here some fantastic job, he truly made a masterpiece here, an almost flawless movie that manages to survive time, a great story, with a big moral issue ( should you support your friends even when they are doing bad things, or should you try to stop him no matter what consequences) does rat on your friend make you a bad person, we know what Anna Schmidt thinks. The Third Man also has some great charming performances, good writing, amazing cinematography,score, editing and direction, it is one of the best movies of the 40's, and i would not raise an eyebrow if someone told me that this was some of the best work he had ever seen.

158688,tt0169102,aasshhuu2011,india,8,Lagaan Is one of best directed movies of bolywood I have ever seen..,"As it was directed by Ashutosh Govarikar, there is no doubt from watching the movie. As the Lagaan tells about kind of true stories that had ever been happening in India when it was ruled by British government, it makes feel to be on real world living. When in the middle the movie feels to be slow but it has to be as the directed tried to be realistic. Lagaan is the story of those people who were condemned brutally by British Govt. Songs of these movies are euphonious. It is the music direction by A.R. Rehman-who is one of best music director all over the world. He has already been applauded with as Oscar. And the reputed singers-Lata Mangeshkar, Udit Narayan, Asha Bhosale, Sukhwinder Singh make these songs more melodious. And the lyricist- Javed Akhtar made the wonderful combination of words which made song worthwhile ever.The captain's sister plays a wonderful role.

16578,tt0060196,aastabil,united states,4,most overrated film in cinema history,"I just want to say that I don't hate this movie or am I making a statement here just to make a statement. It just seems like everyone is jumping on the ""10 out of 10"" bandwagon, and id like to be the few to give my two cents about a movie may be flashy, but has no depth and is poorly crafted. My main complaint with this movie is Leone's ineptitude for blending tones, which sway between high camp and western sensationalism. He mixes them so awkwardly that one's not sure what is supposed to be funny or what is supposed to be serious. For instance, when tuco is trying force information about the gold out of the dying men in the crashed train, the slow death scenes are so melodramatic and over-the-top that I couldn't help but laugh, but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be laughing or I was really mocking it. The plot is interesting but the story is badly structured and feels all over the place (the scenes where tuco is torturing blonde before he tries to kill him really tried my patience). The characters aren't dimensionalized either and for a 3hour movie I would like to know a little more about them than the fact that one is bad, one is good, and one is ugly (and one really doesn't know what that means... Blonde did some bad things in the movie and yet he was labeled ""good"" and I have no clue as to why Tuco is ugly?). What keeps u wake till the bitter end is Leone's bravura and his passion. Despite the fact that his directing is inept, u definitely feel that he loves these characters and the movie he's making. The romantic score, the fast cutting, the grand sense of battle, the frontier, and adventure all feel like the great fantasy of 4 year old who grew up mesmerized by the stories and the personas of cowboys and Indians. So overall, Leone allows u to watch him play along, but u don't get the sense that he let's u play along with him.  "

24928,tt1375666,aaudk,united kingdom,5,"Disappointed, despite the hype and expectation","I am rather surprised to see so many positive - well, gushing - reviews for this movie. I found it almost outrageously derivative of both The Matrix and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Inception, to me, is an amalgam of the aforementioned two - with a dose of 'The Dirty Dozen' thrown in for good measure. Firstly I could not empathize with the main thrust of the plot: DiCaprio et al should risk their lives and sanity to help a billionaire meglomaniac to rule the world's energy supplies by ensuring his (the billionaire's) main rival breaks up his father's conglomerate gigantic energy-supply company. So there is no higher moral or ethical foundation to the plot or the struggles (and they are gargantuan!) of the characters. Which takes me to my second point - the characters are shadows, almost wafer thin - so again, as a viewer I don't really care too much about their plight. This is a serious drawback when they are almost constantly falling off cliffs, being burned etc etc. Only DiCaprio's character has any real depth, and even his character is derivative of so many lost souls 'trying to get home' movies. Third, while the action scenes are very impressive, with amazing special effects, the danger is so great at each moment - which they survive again and again - that all quickly becomes ludicrously contrived, and we never really doubt they'll survive. The bad guys are all clones and they are clearly useless at their jobs of protecting their paymasters. I was waiting for a 5th level of dream-depth, with the entire Chinese army on the attack .. that was the effect it all had on me. I left the cinema feeling quite disappointed - so much effort, so many effects, so much booming and crashing. Yet it counts for very little if the plot and characterizations are weak.  "

However, if you look carefully, the movie is really shallow and somewhat stupid and paradoxical. There is no amazing plot and meaning except its images of sex and violence which are purely used to shock audiences. The plot is quite simple:The man just suffers what he has done unfortunately! YES, unfortunately! There are so many artificial coincidences, such as Alex's encounter with his old friends and the old writer, which make the movie unbelievable. The sin is inescapable? What I have seen is just an unlucky boy who suffers just because of his bad luck. Dim can be a police after all! Although I really like the depiction of Alex's heart, it seems that there is no deep topic behind it.  "
158552,tt0848228,Aayush Arya (aryayush),india,6,"Epic finale makes it worth watching, but disappointing overall.","There are many movies that are hotly anticipated and there's a huge buzz on Twitter for months before they are released. Usually, I go to watch them with some trepidation∂?like in the case of 'Inception'∂?because I don't expect them to live up to the hype. That wasn't the case with 'The Avengers'. I went in fully expecting to love the movie. I didn't, for the most part. THE PLOT There's perhaps no better way to describe my disappointment with it than to say that even though the whole movie revolved around an object called the Tasseract, by the time it was done, I had no idea what it was. It's surprising how a movie with so many characters and so little time for character and plot development still managed to squander the minutes. Any book or movie has a basic plot, which has only a handful of major variations, and you go in expecting to see a particular writer's take on that basic premise. You expect them to build on it and give it an elaborate new shape. In 'The Avengers', however, the basic plot is all you get∂?a team of heroes are initially uncooperative with each other, they fail against the villain, regroup and then beat him in a final showdown. What little attempts 'The Avengers' makes to dress that plot are so utterly reliant on other movies that have come before that to someone who hasn't seen them, it makes no sense whatsoever. 'The Avengers' assumes that you have watched the Iron Man movies, 'Thor', 'Captain America' and 'The Incredible Hulk' before you set foot in the theater and does not feel the need to explain so many of the incomprehensible things that happen on the screen. A lot of people disagree with me on this point but I think it is nonsensical to expect me to watch five movies before I sit down to watch one. It's the responsibility of the scriptwriter to make sure that the movie stands on its own. THE HEROES Mark Ruffalo in the role of Bruce Banner was fantastic in this movie and I think the funniest character overall. Tony Stark had the best punchlines but Banner's humor was more nuanced, in my opinion. But he did not get nearly as much screen time as he deserved. I'd like to see that guy get a Hulk movie of his own. Captain America, on the other hand, who was damn near useless in a war that involved hordes of flying drones, was a constant presence in the movie. The utter Americanness of Captain America makes me very indifferent towards the character and I thought the movie would've been better without him. Same goes for the Black Widow, who had little to do during the final battle. Hawkeye's storyline in the movie made no sense either, and Samuel Jackson just did not work as Nick Fury. He wasn't aggressive enough for the part. My favorite character is Iron Man, but he was a shadow of what he was in his own movies. He's supposed to be the funniest of the bunch but I could not really appreciate the punchline-heavy dialog he spouted. I think he's more genuinely funny in the Iron Man movies and, in fact, I'd love to see Jov Favreau direct 'The Avengers 2'. Still, after the Hulk, Iron Man was pretty much the only Avenger who had a significant role to play in the proceedings. THE VILLAIN As for the villain, Loki, the less said the better. He was an embarrassingly underpowered villain and didn't seem imposing for a second. Take away the drones, which themselves weren't very threatening, and he's almost impotent. He got blasted with a gun-like thing from a man in a suit, for crying out loud. Watching the final battle, it was clear that Iron Man could have taken on him alone∂?six superheroes was beyond overkill to counter this guy. MISCELLANEOUS COMPLAINTS I also took issue with the fact that ordinary humans had no role to play in this movie. There are only two scenes in which they even have a speaking part and they're both used for comic effect (and one of them is also used to try to justify Captain America's presence in this movie) and are inconsequential. It makes you feel detached from the movie; the action might be happening on Mars, for all anyone cares. The people who liked the movie, which is nearly everyone who saw it, are saying that the action was awesome and that's all anyone really wanted from this movie. Maybe you did, but that doesn't work for me. While the action at the end is of an epic scale that is rarely matched even in Hollywood, the dialog and plot are far more essential for me. THE ACTION I'll say this about the action though: it was involving. In plenty of movies, epic battle scenes are filmed in such a way that you feel like you are watching the action from the outside. It's a jumbled mess of explosions and flying debris. In 'The Avengers', despite its six heroes and an army of flying drones, you could see the individual participants and feel like you were in the middle of the action. It was very satisfying, particularly in 3D. CONCLUSION When you watch truly horrible movies, you exit the theater hoping that they never make a sequel (or at least resolving that you won't watch it if it were to be made), but that's not the case here. The potential for a great movie is clearly there, and I am glad that there will be a sequel to this movie∂?I just hope someone does a better job of making it. A story is about more than just its climax.  "

Enter the Joker (Heath Ledger), a fearless psychopath who pushes Batman and its residents into a battle. Christopher Nolan has skillfully woven action and suspense wonderfully in the movie. The Dark Knight's real star is Heath Ledger, who stole the show with his remarkable performance. The cracked white makeup of the Joker along with his blood-red lips makes him even more frightening. And while Nicholson(in Batman(1989)) was a merry, scary joker's acts like ""do you know how i got these scars?"", are even darker.

126507,tt0091251,Ab Juaner,united states,10,Come and see a boy who was robbed off of his youth and was forced to be a man through the horrors of war.,"Come and See aimed to tell not just another story of WWII, but the one that we have probably missed to recount. The Nazi occupation of Belorussia was almost overshadowed by the accounts of Holocaust, nevertheless, it was as tragic as the latter's story. This is not about the heroics of a few soldiers or the betrayal of a comrade. This is the story of the witnesses and casualties of war, the ones who were left unarmed and defenseless from extreme brutality. Elem Klimov's portrayal may not give you the adrenaline rush caused by heavy action fight scenes and he may not have shown a lot of bloodshed, but without a doubt, he will make you weak. He left me psychologically exhausted. The excellent sound design which gave a feeling of turbulence throughout the film will leave you in discomfort almost as if you were being assaulted. My senses were abused. The excruciating face of Florya, the image Glascha saw at his home and the whole scene of the village burned were all unforgettable and haunting. I was traumatized. Klimov's way of storytelling is not simply by making you watch it unfold, he will give you a sense of almost being there right beside Florya. And together, you are both scarred and changed for life. This film is the epitome of anguish and madness brought about by war. It will remind you that when the war is over and done, there are physical and psychological wounds that will never heal and there are boys and girls who will never be children again. What I appreciated most about Come and See is that it was not your typical glamorous war film. It stayed true, closest to the heart of the story it wanted to tell.  "

Though the entire movie takes place in a single jury room (with a broken ceiling fan of course) but has got an intoxicating screenplay where several twists and turns awaits you. There's a scene where it starts raining all of a sudden, a scene which brings a fantastic change to the story where you, as an audience, feel like taking a break from the hassle and enjoy rain.

Together they repeatedly break the rules and regulations of the asylum and are punished. Believing he doesn't belong there McMurphy decides to run away until things take a very tragic turn.

157981,tt0848228,ab30790,india,10,awesome movie for nerds,"You don't need me to tell you it's the culmination of a five-year plan that began with Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury taking Tony Stark aside at the end of the first ""Iron Man"" to tip him off as to the ""Avengers Initative."" There is a bigger picture, he told him -- and here it is: The be-all but not (they're hoping) the end-all of the current craze for CGI-enhanced super heroics. Interspersing flip one-liners with a host of larger-than-life characters and the usual flurry of fight-and-flight scenes, the film is never less than amusing. Still, it's never more than amusing either. Marvel Studios has made it a point of pride to diverge from the grim severity popularized in the DC / Warner Bros Batman films. The lightness is fun but it doesn't offer much of a foundation on which to build an epic. And let's face it, there's more than a whiff of opportunism about a project that pits a defrosted World War II hero, Captain America (Chris Evans), an inventor-industrialist, Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), the pagan lightning god, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a scientist with anger- management issues, Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and SHIELD agents Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) against the Norse god of mischief, Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and a legion of marauding aliens. In 3-D. Meet the boss of 'The Avengers' Chris Hemsworth is 'Thor' Chatting with the 'Iron Man 2' cast Still, Whedon (who shares a screenplay credit with Zak Penn) is a very sharp operator. He knows which buttons to press and where there's room for a little diversion. The improbability of this misfit coalition becomes the movie's most rewarding asset. Imagine the bristling egos of so many power players cooped up in the same room! The movie delivers the kind of pleasures usually reserved for fan fiction or playground stand-offs. Not surprisingly, Robert Downey Jr.'s flip, cynical Stark (Iron Man) gets a good measure of the movie's best lines, bouncing off Steve Rogers' (Captain America) boy scout idealism and Thor's guileless sledgehammer style (sometimes literally). Whedon also crafts a couple of choice scenes beautifully tailored for Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, a far more interesting character here than she appeared to be in ""Iron Man 2.""great action, 3d is the best up till now. Robert Downey Jr is hilarious n is the glue that holds the movie together. hulk come in last but is the best in the movie.  "
2663,tt0111161,ab5_2000,australia,10,one of the greatest," yes this movie is one of the greatest  This movie changed my thinking about people who go to prison. I believe that everyone deserves a second chance no matter what it is. They need to be given a chance to change themselves. Morgan Freeman did justice to his role i was really touched at the end part when he's there for the parole and the words that came out of his mouth. Tim Robbins was tremendous, its the first time i noticed him as an actor and he's one of the best.  prison is terrible place to be its like a whole new world and my perspective has changed about that. I rate this movie 10/10 its the best, the story is great and the director does a great job. well done  "
158644,tt0169102,ab5_2000,australia,10,Lagaan is untouchable," Yeah I watched lagaan the year it came out and I thought it was one the best movies that Indians have ever made and they should be proud of themselves. Its movies like these that make a person feel good about themselves and it makes you want to achieve more in life. I remember when I first watched Lagaan (3yrs ago), it was on VHS the print was terrible but it didn't stop me from watching it. I loved it even though they had cut some bits out. I later got it on DVD and I must say the quality is much better. I kept watching this movie over and over again and have studied it also, I love the making of a movie its so intriguing. Everyone puts on great a performance; Aamir khan is the Protagonist, he so realistic and versatile. He has been my fav actor since 1990 in Dil, he was great, he's one of the finest actors Bollywood has (Also you have got watch Dil Chahta Hai he puts on a great performance). Gracy is new and unique she will do fine, no one would have suited as lead actress except her, a great job. All the eleven members of the team also deserved to be applauded it was cause of them that lagaan worked, same goes for the other opposite team. Rachel Shelley and Paul Blackthorne have done great acting; since they can't speak Hindi it would have been very difficult. They bring a certain amount of realism to the story and how British people use to be like back in the late 1800's. But most importantly, the man behind the scene deserves the most credit Ashutosh Gowariker the writer and director. This would not have been an easy movie to make and bringing it to silver screen is something amazing. I have been reading other peoples comments on lagaan as well, and many people have a problem that the length of the movie is to long, (hey look at the bright side at least you get your moneys worth) I can understand, in the beginning I found the movie a tad slow but it needed to introduce u to the village, characters, and most importantly the time frame. But once that goes ur glued to the movie till the end. Indian movies are very different to western movies, and what makes it unique are the song and dance routines, I thought the music and lyrics were so beautiful. The background music was superb. People also complained that song and dance routines are waste of time I don't think so, I think it's a way celebrating life and people like that. I really wished that lagaan would have got the Oscars, it would have been the first one for India, and all their hard work would have payed off. I haven't seen No mans Land but from the sound of it, it looks good. India just had some tough competitors. Now that lagaan has opened doors internationally India will very soon get an Oscar and I think it will be an Aamir Khan movie, which will get it. Lagaan will always remain a story untouched; Wonderfully made and showcased, I would give it ten out of ten, one of the greatest movies of all time.   "
149962,tt1663202,abacaba,norway,1,How do I wash this movie out of my brain?,"There is almost nothing good to say about this film. It was painful to watch, slow, no joy or any good feelings, and just plain boring after a while. I cannot understand why it got so many awards. Even the nature scenes which were beautiful were impossible to enjoy because of the feeling of dread hanging over every scene. The last hour was predictable. I dreaded what was to come, holding out hope that it would not be a long drawn out ending to an exhausting film. Unfortunately, the pain was drawn out. Like a bad dream that would not end. It is worse than a waste of my money, it ruined my evening and will make me feel awful for days. Avoid this film.  "
122862,tt0266697,abaiello,united states,10,Coolest bout with formalism I have ever seen," Tarantino has made a gem with 'Kill Bill'. It is a beautiful piece of formalistic cinema never with a dull moment. Uma Thurman shines, in more way than one, as the protagonist of the film, and each character is as interesting as the next. The colors and abstract camera angles (multiple use of the bird's eye angle) keep your eyes glued to the screen, and the original music (made by the RZA) and other music complements the film with perfection. Don't be fooled by the preview or the title...this film is absolutely incredible to watch, and maybe even better to listen to (the sound design with the music is incredible)  "
23984,tt0109830,abailes,united states,1,Sugar-coated Trojan horse," This movie uses all the sappy, sentimental tricks in the book to sucker the audience into believing in poor, disadvantaged Forrest Gump: the sick mother, the bad legs, the innocence of incomplete mental capacity, the bullies, the girlfriend, etc. If that's as far as it went, however, I wouldn't be writing this. The dangerous thing about this movie is its sweeping generalizations and stereotypical portrayals of events, groups, and people in recent American history. Because the filmmakers have succeeded in getting the viewer to pull so strongly for Gump, they can then pass off their revisionist version of the past few decades with little objection from the viewer. Yes, it's just a movie, but images like these shape the way people think. The anti-war movement in the sixties and seventies and the Black Panthers, for example, were much more complex than portrayed in this movie. Using tiny, value-charged episodes to paint with such broad brush strokes, in settings that are designed to pull the viewer to Gump's side, is deceptive and manipulative.   "
77261,tt0180093,Abalister,Canada,10,Still is the best picture I've ever seen.,"I'm sitting here, in September 2014, thinking of my all-time favourite movies, and Requiem for A Dream has been there, on top of my list, for 14 years. I have never felt such raw emotion watching a movie; before and after Requiem's release. I went through all possible kinds of emotions watching this masterpiece. I've seen it probably 20 times over the years and the result is always the same. It's a jaw-dropping experience. I remember hearing the soundtrack the first time in 2000, while watching the movie, and I couldn't believe how perfect it was added to the 3 seasons of the movie. The soundtrack has been used many times since then for commercials, trailers and whatnot, but to me, this is the Requiem's soundtrack. The 4 main acting performances in the movie are perfection. I connected with all of them. The cinematography, the editing and the directing are still amongst the best I've ever seen. The movie doesn't age at all. I always wondered why it wasn't up for many Oscars? (Picture, Director, Cinematography, Screenplay, Supp Actor and Supp Actress). I guess not many people saw the movie when it came out in the Fall of 2000. This is movie perfection, an experience I will never forget, one of the best movies ever made, a tragic story but yet so close to what many humans must go through in their regular lives. If someone out there has not seen this masterpiece, I envy you. I wish I could re-live the 2 hours I went through the first time I saw this. A moment I will never forget. A must-have in any movie collection. A movie for the cinephiles.  "
1337,tt0111161,abapplegate,united states,8,This is my review of the film: The Shawshank Redemption,"The Shawshank Redemption has always been one of my favorite films to watch. I was introduced to this movie by my dad, who has always been a huge fan of the film. I didn't think at first I would have liked the movie, but I was wrong. Tim Robbins plays a character called Andy; who was sentenced to prison for committing a crime he never committed. Tim Robbins did a remarkable job of playing Andy. Andy had this attitude about him that captured the audience in a special way. He was always so calm, and although he had been put in prison for something he didn't do and, was treated horribly by some of his fellow inmates; he still remained a humble individual. He didn't let these actions of others affect his life. He knew he didn't do anything wrong. He knew what kind of a man he was, and he wanted out of prison.   Morgan Freeman played ""Red"" a character whom Andy befriended in prison. Just like the audience watching the film, Red was always drawn to Andy. Andy always kept Red guessing of what was to come. I always enjoyed the relationship shared between Andy and Red. It's the kind of friendship you'd want with someone-even given the circumstances in which they were living. Eventually, Andy devised a plan and escaped Shawshank. Red eventually was let out of prison and went on to find Andy. This was another one of my favorite parts of the movie; not only the fact that Andy escaped from the prison in which he didn't belong but Red and him were reunited. I think in the end despite the fact that Red and Andy were prison inmates; everyone was on their side. They had never really seemed like they belonged in prison. They seemed like they were good people. Above all I believed after so long some people just learn their lesson and deserve to be sent home. This film is truly amazing and never gets old for me. There will never be another one quite like it. "
50629,tt0407887,a-bardhi,canada,8,Loved the acting,"I just watched the movie, and is great. I did not think that the movie is the best of this year, meaning that another movie should have won the Oscars. Most importantly this is not the best work of Scorcese. I guess the Accademy just had to give him an Oscar, but this is not the best work of him. I don't want to be commenting the movie itself. I would like to let you know my opinion about the actors and their work. I am always wonderfully and beautifully surprised by Di Caprio. He is The best young actor we have today. If I was to make a comparison between his work and the Fabulous Jack Nicholson, I would say that they shone the same way. Great Great cast, Great Great work from all the actors. Would I suggest you to go and watch this movie? Definitevly ""YES"". Go there watch the movie, spend some time outside the house. But you will need to keep a light stomach if you have e low tolerance for violence.  "
11555,tt0108052,abaris,austria,10,Breathtaking," This is Spielberg's masterpiece. Most members of my family found their end in the gas-chambers and so Schindler's list was a very personal movie to me. Before seeing it, I never would have thought, that a director like Spielberg, would be able to create such feelings of total distress, desperation and hope. Only the ending with the jewish rites of the stones on the grave of Schindler was a little bit disapointing. In my oppinion nothing else than a bow to the box office. Schindler's list is a great film. It shows the holocaust as it really might have happened and leaves you with a feeling of fear that it might happen again in any country, at every given time.  "
35418,tt0102926,abasile-149-559828,australia,10,A Rare Faultless Masterpiece,"Several months ago, I watched The Silence of The Lambs after hearing of its notorious reputation as being one of the best films ever made. After viewing this movie, I went on to view all other films in the franchise (except Hannibal Rising) and also read every book in the franchise (all of which were also fairly good). After thinking about how much I loved TSOTL, I've felt compelled to write this review. Anthony Hopkins delivers an extraordinary performance as Hannibal Lecter, as does Jodie Foster as Agent Starling and as does every single other actor/actress. It starts off by hastily introducing us to the circumstances in which the film takes place and then slowly builds to what can be described as multiple climaxes that occur over the course of the film. A genius plot; a young FBI trainee hunting down a serial killer on the loose with the assistance of a super-intelligent incarcerated cannibalistic psychopath. No faults whatsoever. A brilliant film definitely deserving of its place in the first 30 spots of IMDb's top 250.  "

139289,tt0112471,abb10-2,united states,4,"well, coming from the director of Dazed and Confuse, what would you expect?","The bottom line is whether or not the film was entertaining or not. Yes and no. The story depicts two people falling in love for the evening. But did the viewer become attached to their situation by the end? No, at the end of the film, the two forget the idea o never seeing each other again and decide to meet there exactly six months from that date, no matter the circumstances. At times the realness of the characters sort of turns a part of the audience off by giving away too much of the character's personalities. The part of the audience that could identify with particular traits of the characters was pleased, but the other became a bit alienated by doing this. This latter part of the audience, the part that was not so swayed by the character's identities, must have been thankful that the 18 plus hours of the adventure were not actually shot in real-time, or more relationships would have been weakened rather than strengthened due to one of the two leaving the movie theater out of pure boredom. The point is that the story was not maximized to its full potential. The characters were lacking traits that could have made them dynamic. Although Linklater was playing off of the realistic atmosphere he was trying to create, often this does not describe the reason people go to the movies: to fulfill a fantasy; to enter a new, entertaining world for a ninety minute time span. If the viewer is not entranced by the artificial world created within the movie, then viewers will not be inspired. And if there exists no inspiration, then life would get, well, boring.  "

It really made me think about the real world and that it is maybe not so good to have everything perfect. In this film the main character Jim Carrey was very controlled and likable compared to other movies he has stared in such as the Mask and Ace Ventura. This movie the 'Truman Show' is about a man called Truman, who has been put in a fake world since birth and everyone around him is acting. This world is placed in the middle of Hollywood and everyone is watching him from their TV sets. I think the main point the director was trying to put across was that maybe the perfect world would not be a good place to live eg. Nothing exciting and new happens. I think the director was successful with this. This film is very good and i would recommend it to anyone who likes Jim Carrey's acting style.  "

Hayao Miazaki is obviously a man who cares deeply for the environment, and I truly think this film shows his undeniable love and compassion for all living things better than all of his movies. This Anime contains some of the most powerful and touching scenes I have ever seen in any movie, anime or no. I cry without fail every time I watch it. In my opinion, this is truly the most precious masterpiece in all Anime films. I recommend this to anyone, whether you enjoy Anime films or not, there is just no denying how wonderful this film is.

About an office man who falls in love with the elevator girl, is giving up his apartment for a promotion, and with a suicide attempt involved, this is a fun film. Jack Lemmon and Shirley McClaine are a perfect match in a movie. Jack Lemmon is a hilarious lover, and Shirley is the loved one.

""City of God"" is the name of one of the most notoriously violent slums that surround Rio de Janeiro. This movie was shot on location in the dangerous Rio favelas (slums). The casting does a good job showing the diversity of those living in the slums. Many of the actors actually grew up in the favelas. Luis Ot«≠vio, who is from the ""City of God"" itself, plays the main character Buscap«∏/Rocket. The movie follows a group of children as they grow up in the slum surrounded by violence and drugs and tells their stories. Buscap«∏ is the narrator and we get an insider's perspective on the situation that has plagued the slums of Rio for quite some time now. It is through this character that the audience is able to enter into the violent world of the ""City of God"". Buscap«∏ learned through the experiences of his older brother just what happens when you get involved in the drug wars that hold the favela captive and decides to take a different route in life. He is a very raw and real character, one that we can easily relate to. He is desperately trying to find a way out. Unfortunately the viewer is left feeling a certain amount of impotence with the whole situation. Many people die and the young children that survive are all ready to begin the vicious cycle all over again. There seems to be no end in sight of the violence. The one who does make it out ∂?

This film was funny at times and also had an interesting twist with all of the detective work and Esposito went back through the period of time when he was investigating the crime. The ending is far from what I was expecting and I'm not sure that I like it. The movie brings into question the idea of justice and how it is served, while providing a slight criticism of the government and their dealings within the judicial system.

The three micro-stories (Octavio and Susana, Daniel and Valeria, El Chivo y Maru) are all connected by a single car crash, but it takes the whole movie to piece together the puzzle of how they are all connected. I think that the reason I like this movie so much is the raw emotion that is portrayed. It is definitely not an easy one to watch, and at times I had to close my eyes because I simply couldn't stand the images that flooded the screen, but I couldn't stop watching. It's just so real ∂? the love, the frustrations, the disappointment, the small moments of happiness. Even with all the unfortunate events, the film doesn't leave you empty or depressed.

5459,tt0071562,Abby Smalberg,united states,10,Great Film,"Taking a best-selling novel of more drive than genius (Mario Puzo's The Godfather), about a subject of something less than common experience (the Mafia), involving an isolated portion of one very particular ethnic group (first-generation and second-generation Italian-Americans), Francis Ford Coppola has made one of the most brutal and moving chronicles of American life ever designed within the limits of popular entertainment.  The Godfather, which opened at five theaters here yesterday, is a superb Hollywood movie that was photographed mostly in New York (with locations in Las Vegas, Sicily, and Hollywood). It's the gangster melodrama come of age, truly sorrowful and truly exciting, without the false piety of the films that flourished forty years ago, scaring the delighted hell out of us while cautioning that crime doesn't (or, at least, shouldn't) pay.  It still doesn't, but the punishments suffered by the members of the Corleone Family aren't limited to sudden ambushes on street corners or to the more elaborately choreographed assassinations on thruways. They also include lifelong sentences of ostracism in terrible, bourgeois confinement, of money and power, but of not much more glory than can be obtained by the ability to purchase expensive bedroom suites, the kind that include everything from the rug on the floor to the pictures on the wall with, perhaps, a horrible satin bedspread thrown in.  Yet The Godfather is not quite that simple. It was Mr. Puzo's point, which has been made somehow more ambiguous and more interesting in the film, that the experience of the Corleone Family, as particular as it is, may be the mid-twentieth-century equivalent of the oil and lumber and railroad barons of nineteenth-century America. In the course of the ten years of intra-Mafia gang wars (1945-1955) dramatized by the film, the Corleones are, in fact, inching toward social and financial respectability.  For the Corleones, the land of opportunity is America the Ugly, in which almost everyone who is not Sicilian or, more narrowly, not a Corleone, is a potential enemy. Mr. Coppola captures this feeling of remoteness through the physical look of place and period, and through the narrative's point of view. The Godfather seems to take place entirely inside a huge, smoky, plastic dome, through which the Corleones see our real world only dimly.  Thus, at the crucial meeting of Mafia families, when the decision is made to take over the hard drug market, one old don argues in favor, saying he would keep the trade confined to blacks ∂?""they are animals anyway.""  This is all the more terrifying because, within their isolation, there is such a sense of love and honor, no matter how bizarre.  The film is affecting for many reasons, including the return of Marlon Brando, who has been away only in spirit, as Don Vito Corleone, the magnificent, shrewd old Corleone patriarch. It's not a large role, but he is the key to the film, and to the contributions of all of the other performers, so many actors that it is impossible to give everyone his due.  Some, however, must be cited, especially Al Pacino, as the college-educated son who takes over the family business and becomes, in the process, an actor worthy to have Brando as his father; as well as James Caan, Richard Castellano, Robert Duvall, Al Lettieri, Abe Vigoda, Gianni Russo, Al Martino, and Morgana King. Mr. Coppola has not denied the characters' Italian heritage (as can be gathered by a quick reading of the cast), and by emphasizing it, he has made a movie that transcends its immediate milieu and genre.  The Godfather plays havoc with the emotions as the sweet things of life∂?marriages, baptisms, family feasts∂?become an inextricable part of the background for explicitly depicted murders by shotgun, garrote, machine gun, and booby-trapped automobile. The film is about an empire run from a dark, suburban Tudor palace where people, in siege, eat out of cardboard containers while babies cry and get underfoot. It is also more than a little disturbing to realize that characters, who are so moving one minute, are likely, in the next scene, to be blowing out the brains of a competitor over a white tablecloth. It's nothing personal, just their way of doing business as usual.  THE GODFATHER (MOVIE)  Directed by Francis Ford Coppola; written by Mario Puzo and Mr. Coppola, based on the novel by Mr. Puzo; director of photography, Gordon Willis; edited by William Reynolds, Peter Zinner, Marc Laub, and Murray Solomon; music by Nino Rota; production designer, Dean Tavoularis; produced by Albert S. Ruddy; released by Paramount Pictures. Running time: 175 minutes. "

We got to recognize the society is getting interrupted by the market system. People has already forgot what they dream for. The ultimate goal of life is not about money, but about the value deep inside your heart. The film is well made with many different views about life learned throughout the grow-up of the boy, it raises the concern between sacrificing nature to get better development in city. We have lost ourselves in a blurred vision of society, and let the ""empty hole"" dominating us and motivating us to work and give up enjoying the nice pieces around us. Like ""Cars"", it gets us to know what time to stop and look around the things you have in hand. Everyone is stuck into a puzzle they cannot give up the social perception or the belief not to go away for a try to involve in the world. It does give us surprise if we learn how to makes friend with it. We don't always be jammed in car congestion, or being upset for a salary cut and unable to purchase food in high-class restaurants. Have a wider vision, the world is different to us. There is always strong struggle between the operation of society and preservation of nature. Every human should be of the same status. Every one single man is valuable. What I have been touched in the scene that a guard has caught Christopher for taking the train, just because he doesn't have money or an identity even. In today's world, you have to take up every issues by the useless papers and some rubbish cards. Just one small paper can get you into paradise or to the hell. Identity cards, passports, cheques, ... from when on did people give so many limitations to themselves? The theme of film brought about is what I enjoy and agree very much. It is the definition of happiness. Definitely of much deeper study in happiness than ""Pursuit of Happiness"". Happiness does not come from money, it also cannot come from independence. God creates the world and get people to enjoy, but not their own selves. From the movie, the most enjoyable moments are the time when Christopher meets every new people in a spot. ""Happiness comes true only when shared."" It shows great Christianity and nature in the movie. The ""God Bless Us"" in the backside, the salvation village has got the characters and audience relaxed. The superb landscape and marvelous natural world has fascinated me in the complete 120 minutes. It is fun and documentary-like, filming of animals and plants captured in the character's journey, recording of daily conversations with new friends met in his trip. Thanks to the cameramen and editors, shots on the beach or sea are so smooth and genuine, it is like a real travel show but brings meaning to life. It could be named as ""No Country For Young Man"". The young guy needs to take risk and go everywhere he likes, regardless of the limit society has hanged on to him, regardless of his parents. He really does a ""jumper"" job: Everywhere is possible. In the world we find no place for a young and active person to go free, freedom should be the right to born with, however, life is not under control by oneself. All are obliged to regulations and instructions. Set by whom? God even would not stop us to go on our own way. The territories should not once be there. It's time to change old men's rules. The world would get wonderful, only a few steps to walk out of our sight. Lead your lifestyle and don't lose control of your life by temptations brought in society. Learn to appreciate everything around, and sunshine is being with us always.  "
38483,tt0110413,abby2725,united states,10,Natalie Portman was amazing,"So, I've been a fan of this movie ever since I was a little girl. Natalie Portman, as usual, was breathtaking and at such a young age! She was truly who I wanted to be when I was younger. She made this movie. Without Matilda and without Natalie Portman playing Matilda, this movie would be terrible. The way she handled her family's death was awing, simply breathtaking. I love this movie in more ways than one and definitely recommend it to others. I wanted to see what happened to Matilda though and still do. Did she grow up and clean like Leon did? What did she do?! It's so frustrating when movies end like that but do not make a sequel. However, a remake would surely be refreshing but I feel it would do no justice to the first film.  "
18347,tt0137523,Abby-9,united states,7,are they crazy?," I would give Edward Norton an oscar for this movie and still rate it at ""6"" because crazy people are not worth so much of my time and energy.

37558,tt0118799,Abby-9,united states,10,One-line summary? Don't miss this movie.," I put off seeing this ""romance"" because of a basically grumpy temperament. Now I will want to see IL POSTINO as well. Don't want to miss any dimensions of humanity made available through a great and deep comic personality. I'm an older person who first learned of the Nazi concentration camps through documentary footage from the Nuremburg trials shown in my Texas high school. How to ever recover from this knowledge, much less the actual experience? Well, to paraphrase Andre Gide, you don't get to the far shore without losing sight of the shore behind you. Roberto Begnini and his fine cast welcome us to the far shore. Here, the love and care for family and children is far more important than any personal pain, even one's own death. That the character Guido is capable of clowning for the hidden eyes of the child while being taken away by an armed soldier is a lesson in courage as great as in the great samurai films. The quiet and surprisingly strong character of Dora gives a third point of support to the power of LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL. Her insistence on going with her family to the camp is humbling when you recognize her options and test your own ability to sacrifice any comfort or advantage. The love between these three -- the adoration of the father by the child, the care between the parents and love for their child -- reflects a transcendent reality which is played against brute power in the ongoing battle between Heaven and Hell. How can we endure such pain? Through comedy, through love . . . And please also credit for depth of situation shown to the gentle old uncle, the Nazi doctor going crazy, the Italian school director easily embracing Fascism as she might embrace any other new educational fad. Also must credit the patient horse and the kitten. In SCHINDLER'S LIST (black and white), a touch of color, a little red coat, (thank you Akira Kurosawa -- see HIGH AND LOW) made sharply poignant the loss of a child in the camp. Here, a live kitten looking for the child who cared for it is left with the pile of clothing of the dead children. Life gone, life remaining. Life IS beautiful . . . the movie is teaching us. Learn, the undercurrent of it whispers, and live well. I'm really grateful for this film.  "

In this film pot works when all else has failed. Just didn't want to overlook that dynamic. Unlike a comedy of the 70's or 80's pot in this film is the key to sublime success. Sort of.

103055,tt0083658,Abby-9,united states,10,Part of our contemporary mythology," Saw this movie many times.

133384,tt0052618,Abby-9,united states,9,Wonderful at many levels," I hadn't seen this since I was a kid, and got it to share with some kids I know. I was really surprised how much is in the motion picture that I was too young/inexperienced to appreciate. Also, my young friends were transfixed by it, as I was 40 years ago. The strength of Charlton Heston's characterization of Judah Ben-Hur carries a lot of the weight, but is born not only from his acting, but from the original story. I've been thinking of Heston the NRA president lately, and didn't remember how boldly he plays compassion on the screen. Now, the whole reason i'm writing this comment: i can't even believe the chariot race. How it must have been filmed. And wrangled. And played. And edited. I am watching it again and again, to see the skill of the equine actors especially. And so gratified by the affectionate appreciation Judah Ben Hur gives his horses after the race. From the barren landscapes to the spare, beautifully photographed interiors, and then to the massive arena filled with spectators, this is a film to get the kids' imaginations into a reasonably depicted Roman Empire, into the history of conflicting cultures, and into human questions like loyalty and responsibility. And Jesus was around. Can't say he wasn't.   "
136503,tt1028532,Abbye-Sei,Hong Kong,10,A truly inspiring story,"This is one of the best films that I have ever watched, it is the most heartwarming and yet the most heart wrencking movie, can't recall any film have such emotional impact on me. I still keep thinking about the story and every time when I think about it, I felt sad and so sorry for both the Prof and the dog, I am sure this is a film I won't forget ... the soundtrack is another praise.., definitely a classic for Richard Gere.. Although the movie centered on the bond/love between Hachi and his human parent, this is also a story about love between spouse, love between friends, father-daughter love and most of all, a close knit community of people with a big heart... My favourite scene is where Mrs Wilson come back to town after 10 years and found Hachi still waiting, so touching I can't control my tears... the closing scene is just devastating, Hachi died still dreaming of his master coming out of the train station..... This is a must see movie for every dog lovers. For human, dogs may just be a part of our life, but for the dog(s), we are everything they got. Again, Richard Gere is just superb and natural, so did Joan Allen. And lastly the dogs are so cute and adorable. A truly remarkable wait - 10 years... words failed to describe the amount of love, devotion and loyalty Hachi had for Parker...  "

38521,tt0110413,ABC DEF,united states,10,One of the best films of all time,"This movie is one of my top 5 favorites of all time. Lot of reasons for it. It combines a great and interesting storyline, coupled with stellar acting performances. Oldman really puts the punch into the villainous role, he is terrific, but Portman steals away the show from everyone. It could be one of the top performances in a female role, and that too by a young girl. The novelty of the story is it's handling of the relationship between and elder man and young girl in an entirely different manner. The chemistry between Reno and Portman is amazing. Overall, the movie is great from the start to the end, including the climax.  "

If we take this film as a whole, it was breathtaking right from the start. Before watching the film, i had doubts whether Bruce Willis was suitable for this role. However he was as good as the kid. I don't expect this film to get an Oscar. And i don't think it will get a nomination either. But i believe that the kid really deserves one. Whoever says anything about the film to a friend who hasn't seen it, will be doing something terrible to him. If a friend of yours starts to tell you something about the film, get away from him at once and don't ever see him again!  "

"
30802,tt0133093,ABCgirl,united states,9,impeccable and satisfyingly complex!," I went into this movie expecting ""good,"" and I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was excellent! Invigorating scenes left me breathless with the sleek set and costume design, flawless choreography, and deliciously bad-a** feel to the whole film. The story itself is wonderfully complex and there are very few loose ends in the background and plot, which are usually a big problem in sci-fi/action movies. The philosophy behind the story is well-expressed by Morpheus and Trinity, and indeed fits nicely with the big picture. In fact, there are several parallels between the story and religious faith, but that is a whole other can of worms. Keanu Reeves is a stroke of casting genius as the rumpled, fly-by-the-seat-of his-pants Neo, whose true purpose, identity, and talents are yet undiscovered until he is tapped by the Resistance. He has only recently begun to earn some of my respect with an excellent performance in Devil's Advocate, and now the Matrix. However, I am still rather scarred from his ""Dracula"" farce. Carrie-Anne Moss does quite well in this role; a nice change from her ""Models, Inc"" days, and a terrific showcase of her chiseled features. Laurence Fishburne is perfect as the omniscient, eloquent and always-composed leader, Morpheus. Several instances of subtle comic relief were appreciated--the activated sprinklers that drenched the agents as well as Keanu's Bruce Lee tribute in his fight with eerily articulate, 10-words-per-minute agent. Storyboards were put to good use, and the action was easy to follow throughout the movie, even with all the trans-dimensional activity going on. Lighting in every shot was exceptional, conveying a sterile feel about the whole environment. Sound design was also exceptional; it put the audience amid all the action on camera. The soundtrack fits perfectly with the film--the silver bow on a beautiful package. Highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart. A terrific show with an intriguing and insightful plot. This film gives you a lot to chew on well after you've seen it.   "
112618,tt0046912,abcj-2,united states,8,"I don't love it, but I'm still drawn to it.","DIAL M FOR MURDER is not my least favorite Hitchcock film, but it also isn't my favorite. However, it has grown on me with repeated viewings, so I'm updating an old review I had deleted which I originally wrote after my first viewing. It's definitely a film I still want to revisit. I appreciate the stylization and simplicity of the set. Since this was originally released in 3D, that explains why the less is more approach works. The plot is plausible. Grace's wardrobe is simple yet lovely, and Grace herself is as beautiful as always. My issues were and still are with the casting and the acting...two pretty big issues. I don't believe for one minute that Grace Kelly's character would love, much less marry Ray Milland's. I also don't believe that she would become romantically involved with Robert Cummings. Fine actors on their own, they are not credible to me as love interests for such a young beauty. That element weakens the whole plot. The acting leans toward the over-the-top melodrama of the Golden Age. This is quite unusual and unnecessary in a Hitchcock film. Grace is guilty of it herself. Her accent bothered me originally. She sounds a little British and a little bit of Hollywood vocal polish. Milland, who can be very charming, is almost too bland and his clipped speech drains away his emotion to such a point that it is hard to connect with his character at all and to see how Grace ever could have fallen in love with him. Robert Cummings is pure American Pie, which he really is, but he doesn't seem like someone who would attract Grace Kelly away from her debonair yet older husband. None of the characters seem full of enough emotion to be caught up in a love triangle much less a murder plot. I am plenty capable of suspending belief, but if this movie is going to be so highly ranked in the IMDb 250 out of all the movies in the world, then I find it quite surprising and tend to wonder if guys are so stuck on Grace (in clothes or even in a nightgown) or loyal to Hitchcock that the implausibility of the plot with all of its flaws with the main characters is accepted without question. I have loved both of these main male stars as well as Kelly in other films. Sometimes I'll watch a film just to get to see these actors act. This one, even after repeated viewings, still bugs me, but I still find myself drawn to it regardless. I've finally realized that it plays like a play. it is simple and the supporting cast and mystery really drive the plot. That is a testament to Hitchcock's ability to pull together a film that doesn't compare in dramatic content to most of his other films, yet it still envelops and endures almost 60 ears later. I'd still say if you are stuck on a Hitchcock picture with Grace Kelly, then go for TO CATCH A THIEF or, even better, REAR WINDOW, but if you are determined to a less action-packed mystery, then DIAL M will draw you in every time.

71145,tt0364569,abclaret,united kingdom,10,Stunning Revenge Cinema,"This was the first piece of South Korean cinema I ever saw. In fact outside of Kung Fu films, with the exception of Battle Royal, Id never ventured into Asian cinema before, I now know this is a big mistake, because of films out there like Oldboy. Its opened me up to new tastes and this still as to be my favourite film of the last couple of years. Oldboy is about a Kafka-esquire antagonist, Dae-su Oh, who is being punished, for no reason he can comprehend. And the desperation he feels as he lurches to find out why and who is behind his suffering is pretty intense. All the way through the film he his latching on to the remotest of clues in the hope of catching his nemesis, but his rival as a few tricks up his sleeve. All pushing towards a conclusion with more than a few twists and an ending which is both disturbing, but reassuring given the circumstance. The acting and visuals are excellent. I can appreciate people taking apart the story, it doesn't flow and probably isn't as logical as it could be, but with something this good you can sidestep some of your criticisms in favour of enjoying something so primitive and tragic, as a story about revenge.

Nick NOlte is great in his portrayal of a rogue father. What I loved also was the way emotions were built into the fabric of this film.

38113,tt0118799,AbdAllahMonir,egypt,8,A tale of humanity .,"The movie name means one thing not other, it states ""Life is Beautiful"" so it don't mean Jews are beautiful or Hitler is and it's not to sympathize with any faction. Roberto Benigni the writer, director and the lead actor was able to deliver a tale of tragedy and horrible incidents in history by romanticizing the incidents and making a side of comedy in it. He also was able to win the heart of his audience by presenting Guido, who is a young Italian guy ,a bit of a dreamer and adventurer, romantic and really talkative and loquacious. He loved Dora the teacher who was from another social class and started his own fairy tale with her (Like when she ran with him on the supposedly white horse). Then with the part when the Jews were taking to concentration camps, in which he made all the events seem to his son as a part of a big game they play, and this was my favorite thing in the whole movie. He didn't sugar caught the truth, he hid it from his who wasn't supposed to know such facts and incidents were happening at such young age, and by that Benigni kept the smile that was on your face when the film started but without overdoing it. It's a comedy and drama about ""people"", without any hidden agenda that asks you to take a side or to sympathize with a faction as I said over another, enough reasons to watch the movie are the amazing music, the beautiful sets and and the Italian language it self.

Unfortunately it followed episode 4 and was so boring and so easy to work out and left nothing to the imagination I know what will happen in the next episode, the girl Rey (the new Luke) will train with Luke (the new yoda) and then bring her brother (kylo ren)back from the dark side, they then defeat snooke (emperor) and probably blow up another even more powerful death star.

Best cinematography for showing the true felling of Hugh glass in every time he was going to die without even speaking and to take every scene on spot and not preparing for it but just rehearsing many many times is a triumph. Best actor not because he survived coldness or eat raw meat but for being out of his comfort zone as an actor who worked with a lot of directors and most of the girls love him for his looks and his anger tone but all this didn't match his amazing expressions where some of it was real. Finally i will be out of words if i talked about this crazy creative combination of a director where he didn't just succeeded in showing the real talent behind the cast and crew but also leading them for a legendary movie that will be mined in the movie history of Hollywood and showing us that revenge won't make you feel happy or satisfied but will make carry a heavy burden that could Weigh your movement and make you think only in one direction Also taking the decision to be a part of the movie in thinking by the end did Hugh died or is it a feeling of relief. Lets not forget the amazing cast behind this amazing piece art Tom Hardy or John Fitzgerald who made us hate him every time he appears and showing us one true fact, if you are so evil, evil will eat you alive and also playing an important two roles in a story as a mentor and a villain at the same time.

I have not, and I believe I will not, see a movie that lives up to this one. Kevin Spacey gives a show stopping performance as Lester Burnham, a 40 year old man dealing with a mid-life crisis. Annette Bening (Carolyn Burnham, Lester's wife) and Thora Birch (his daughter) also contribute to this high-caliber film. Wes Bentley does an absolute awesome job as the quiet, self-contained drug dealer. As Lester realizes what he needs to break himself free from his boring and oppressing life, he turns everyone else's upside down. This movie is riddled with dark comedy, but remains a serious drama. I have recommended this film to all of my friends and family and to anyone who wants to view a great film that will leave keep them in their seats start to finish. I gave this film 10, once you see it you will too.  "

I'm dazzled with the scenario, I really am! I always enjoyed what he picks - even though he wasn't the scenarist of course - But he always finds the suitable match for his movies. There is no happy ending, this is for others -- that's what I imagine him to say every time I watch his movies. The plot is breath taking, the movie is about 2h and a half for god's sake, and I didn't feel it at all. I wanted it to continue∂? I believe this is one of the most brilliant screenplays of the year 2014, a lot of things were set carefully, and with an artistic eye, Especially for the main thing in it, the dialog. David Fincher, well! This is not his best movie of course; I felt like he missed some crucial points in some scenes, something was missing as a final touch, some rubbish from the acting staff that he's responsible of, only minor not that big, it was great though as a general work! Didn't affect the story at all. Rosamund Pike played it well, a lot of changes in one movie, and yet! She kept it balanced, I would easily say that she could've got the best actress of the year, she was evil, lover, kind and sweet, and she was Amy the American babe girl. I wouldn't say the same about Ben Affleck, but he definitely was good, what a lot of people don't understand, is that his role made him look like that, his role dictated to be calm and not very emotional and reactive, that's why. The human being has a messed up mind, either you like it or not, this movie is a reminder of that, and the ending was marvelous and explained this point very well, there is no such innocence, it is what it is∂?

I realize this is a pretty trendy movie to like, but frankly backlighting Martin Sheen's ear for the last five hours of play was too pretentious for my taste. I realize this review won't change much, but it surprised me to see that nobody had given this so much as the mildest criticism. If you want a good war movie watch Full Metal Jacket, and if you want Joseph Conrad read the damn book.

3534,tt0068646,Abdulla A Mirahmadi,united arab emirates,10,No one can beat it. one cult classic movie ever,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy, based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name. It stars Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of a fictional New York crime family. The story, spanning 1945 to 1955, chronicles the family under the patriarch Vito Corleone, focusing on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Pacino) from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss.  Paramount Pictures obtained the rights to the novel before it gained popularity for the price of $80,000. Studio executives had trouble finding a director, as their first few candidates turned down the position. They and Coppola disagreed over who would play several characters, in particular Vito and Michael. Filming was done on location and completed earlier than scheduled. The musical score was composed primarily by Nino Rota with additional pieces by Carmine Coppola.  The film was the highest-grossing film of 1972 and was for a time the highest-grossing film ever made. It won the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando) and Best Adapted Screenplay (for Puzo and Coppola). Its seven other Oscar nominations included Pacino, James Caan, and Robert Duvall for Best Supporting Actor and Coppola for Best Director. It was followed by sequels The Godfather Part II (1974) and Part III (1990).  The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in world cinema and one of the most influential, especially in the gangster genre. It was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry in 1990 and is ranked the second-greatest film in American cinema (behind Citizen Kane) by the American Film Institute. "
9589,tt0468569,Abdullah Al Mamun,bangladesh,9,Awesome Movie I Ever Seen,"A screen writing professor of mine once said that what happens in a story must be surprising but expected, and Nolan's approach to The Dark Knight epitomizes this maxim. He gives you exactly what you want, but does it so well that it manages to completely catch you off guard when it happens. But there really is no better way to describe The Dark Knight than to call it a great work of art because it transcends both the boundaries of comic book movie making and even the parameters of good film making. What Nolan and Co. have created doesn't just function as a thrill ride or even a terrific movie, but rather as a substantive and philosophical examination of why we need heroes, and then when we need them, what they mean. "
13043,tt0110912,Abdullah Almosalami,saudi arabia,10,This film is legend.,"This movie is the stuff of legends. It is probably the most influential film ever made - you can find this movie referenced in some way or another in pretty much every piece of media you have - and the amazing thing is, it is pretty much just entirely dialogue with long static shots to hold the viewer's attention on the great performances of the actors/actresses and the even more captivating & clever dialogue. And what's even more amazing is that you can enjoy this and even root for the characters even though all of them are pretty bad people. Between the philosophical discussions between the characters, the great one-liners, and talks about foot massages, and I absolutely guarantee you have never/will never see a movie like this ever again. It is so refreshing, so riveting, I am glad that I watched this film. Normally, I'd break a movie down into its fundamentals, but that's really all you need to know. And ow yeah, Samuel L. Jackson man. What more could you want?  "
91498,tt2106476,Abdullah Almosalami,saudi arabia,10,Oh my word. This is a masterpiece. This is legit a masterpiece.,"(Before I start, anyone reminded of The Crucible watching this?) The thing most viewers loved about the film was how great the story was. But something I would like to point out and why I say this film is masterful is because you can analyze this film to its core and it gets better and better - not the other way around - and that is something that you can almost never do with most films. That alone is a sign of great writing and directing, and that is of great credit to Thomas Vintenberg and Tobias Lindholm for crafting a consistent tightly-knit story revolving around such a touchy subject, and to those wondering about the name, it very nicely reflects the phrase ""witch-hunt"", which is what people are doing in the film. As you've probably read/heard by now, the story is about a teacher who is falsely accused of a horrendous act. Now, even though that is the key point, what the story is really about is how something as simple as the belief in a child's innocence and a few words can get people to completely turn on a person, no matter how irrational or unfair or evil they are being in doing so, in this fit of mass hysteria and paranoia. It's about how terrible social justice and opinion is, and even worse, how terrible it can be to be on the bad side of it. The film also touches on the relationships between people, especially friendships, and how situations like this put these things to the test. It presents how events like these reveal a certain disgustingly maddening aspect of human nature that you would never really imagine to be there, and in that sense, it becomes a fascinating study on human behavior, and from this spawn the debates of many many viewers attempting to make sense of everything. And all of this is gradually built and developed, immersing you more and more, which is crazy because you already start off very well immersed. Multiple times during the film, you feel like you have reached an ultimate low view of humanity and the peak of passionate rage, and then it keeps going and going! You will be on the verge of tears! Now this cannot be achieved without near-perfect acting performances from everyone in the cast, not just the main characters. Mads Mikkelson pulls off one of the greatest performances I've ever seen from this type of character. Every line of dialogue he says not only is so well written but is so well reflected in the performance. I can recall many moments during the film wherein the way he acted is exactly how I've seen people in somewhat similar circumstances. And what's so great about both the acting and character of Mads Mikkelson is that he's not just some clich«∏d utterly vulnerable guy. No, he actually has some strength and pride to him, and he won't just take all the bull!@#$ that comes to him. I loved it! There were so many satisfying moments that came of that. Thomas Bo Larson also completely encompasses a best friend who is being internally pulled apart by the situation, and by the time we see him complete his arc, his character is imprinted in the minds of the viewers as one of the great aspects of the film. And as honorable mentions, I have to say that all the child actors felt refreshingly real and EVEN THE DOG! There was especially one scene where you are not even sure if the dog is legit doing what is being seen or is some kind of movie magic being pulled off here. Now, in this kind of story, the ending is something that writers must do well to avoid being either too unsatisfactory for the viewer or too good to be true. And I'm glad to say that the ending is probably as good as the rest of the film. Part of the genius of the ending is that not only does it leave you thinking about it, but it forces you to reflect back on the entire film, which aside from adding to the mastery of the film, further helps to promote the film as a whole. One can say that the way the ending skipped over a period of time was a bit lazy in writing, and it maybe got a bit sappy, but if you think about what happens at the very end, all of that is very well justified because it was to conveys a certain message which you, the viewer, may interpret different than others (do not mistake this, though, as one of those open-endings some films do, not that that is necessarily bad but is usually done out of laziness and lacks thought and effort). Another thing worthy of note is the cinematography and shot composition. While there were a few moments where the camera wobbled and took the viewer slightly out of the world, the rest of the film is brilliantly filmed and shot. Certain shots are held static and focused on the subject of the shot to add onto the emotion of the scene, and along with the way they are composed, whether the character is being filmed in nature or in a house, fits perfectly in this world set up by the film. I never expected to be so immersed, so riveted, so emotionally hit by this film, but I was. I was actually nearly in tears at one point. This film will take you through an emotional roller-coaster and will leave you exhausted! I salute Thomas Vintenberg, Tobias Lindholm, and the entire cast for their excellence in this film. What a great film.  "

118043,tt2488496,Abdullah Khan,united kingdom,5,A bad return to the Star Wars Franchise,"I'd like to start off by saying that this movie had a lot of good things and bad things about it. I'd rank it 4th in the series of my favourites (6, 4, 5, 7, 3, 2, 1). It tried to look like the 4th Episode, but was absolutely incomparable to it, and the attempt at making it look like that, was awful and a pathetic idea. Good things: 1. Great Action Sequences. We see that the movie has absolutely NAILED it in terms of action. With the Millennium Falcon, and the light saber fights, and the explosions, absolutely seemed like I was there, because of the 3D. 2. Finally, no hate-able character. All the new characters introduced were well on their place. Finn, Poe Dameron, Rey, BB-8, were extremely good characters, and every actor did their role best, and had no overacting like Hayden's and Jake Lloyd's in the prequel trilogy, and the hateable character being Jar Jar, and Queen Amidala. 3. The comedy is back! Even though it isn't the nitty gritty comedy of the Original trilogy, but it's strong and funny on its own ground. I loved it! 4. Han Solo, Leia, and Luke are back. Our favourite characters from the original trilogy. BAD Things: 1. Action was so good, but too much action I feel. I felt that every second in the cinema was just explosions, fights and nothing else. The movie didn't have the lightness that the original trilogy did. 2. They did introduce new characters, but there was no setup, build up to these characters. Rey just became a Jedi, used the force better than the great Luke, at her first try. 3. Why is the whole movie just a mystery of the origins of Rey, JJ Abrams? In this whole movie, we are given hints of who Rey might be. We are hella confused at if she was Han's daughter, or Luke's, or who's?!?! 4. Please don't tell me Finn is the son of Lando Calrissian and Princess Leia! Thought these are theories, but why haven't we been given his origins and details. 5. If you really were to copy the original trilogy, we should have been given a lot more R2-D2 and 3PO. 6. You killed one of our main favourite characters. HAN SOLO, just dies. 7. Only 60 seconds of Luke Skywalker at the end? If you are trying to copy the first episode, where Leia gets kidnapped, we at least got a bit of Leia, whereas Luke was there only for like 60 seconds. 8. The Villains are not really villains. Kylo Ren should have been more like Darth Vader, ""finish what he started"", but is rather in competition with General Hux. 9. Supreme Leader Snoke is not very supreme. So I'll rate it for you guys. +4 for the good stuff about the movie, and -9 for the bad. Total rating = 10. 10 + 4 = 14 14 - 9 = 5 There you go. Hope this review helps! =)  "

The movie, according to me, had lots more potential, could have been one of the best mystery movies EVER made, but much of the movie still remained a mystery. Questions like, why the child was kidnapped, what happened to Hugh Jackman afterwards, were still left unanswered after the movie ended. It needed answers, and this is why the ending was sad too. The movie was very long and I wouldn't have mind watching another half hour for these answers. It did build up lots of suspense, but I also feel that they added parts that had no need to be in the film, just over elongated the film.

Another great movie by Scorsese and Leo.,"I was scrolling down my movie collection, not knowing what to watch for that night. Using IMDb to make sure I chose a good one, I found my self clicking on Shutter Island. Now I heard from some friends that it was a great movie and it had an 8.1 on IMDb so that alone was enough. Plus all the Leonardo DiCaprio movies that I had watched until that point were awesome. So yeah. The first few minutes of the movie went quite slow, and gave an okay intro. The movie had so many thrills in between and the story was great. Two Marshals sent to Shutter Island to investigate the escape of one of the prisoners, a doctor (Ben Kingsley) who sometimes give you the creeps and so many dangerous Psychiatric prisoners. Just when everything was going smooth and I got the feeling of excitement that Leo's character was the only good guy, that is because I presumed Ruffalo's character to have died after falling from the cliff. And I wanted him to escape from the island and bring back more soldiers to investigate the strange happenings on the island and arrest Ben Kingsley LOL. But that was not what the writer of the book thought. And that's a good thing. The twist was so unexpected and... I don't know. For once I didn't imagine Leo's character to have been a prison inmate for the past two years, and seriously Wtf. The one hour and 50 minutes that I had watched until now was nothing but a projection of Leo's character's psycho imagination. I paused the movie at that point and it took me about 5 minutes to figure out what had happened, I was shocked. I don't want to disclose any more details of the plot. Now I have watched Shutter Island thrice and it still doesn't fail to make me feel creeped out. Overall great movie. And I recommend it!...  "

To RISE again I saw the film in 35 millimeter and did not feel deprived, though I'll certainly be heading back to catch it in IMAX at some point.

The scenes of torture, physical and mental, is gruesome, and one of the most stirring scenes ever captured on film. The scene is revisited throughout the film and each incident is even more harrowing than the original. Christopher Walken deserved and earned his Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, and the film was truly the Best Picture of 1978, though one award it missed was Best Actor for De Niro. See this movie at all costs.

His young daughter never quite forgives him for leaving, and his quest is one of survival and return. I especially love the scene of Coop driving away in a cloud of dust, underscored by the space shuttle countdown. Mackenzie Foy as young Murph is sweet and teary, and Jessica Chastain deftly takes her into adulthood as a tough yet tender space crusader. Surprise Matt Damon (the best kind of Matt Damon) is tender and menacing as the ""destroyer of worlds"" - a recurring motif that I enjoy in Nolan's work. The movie has its nonsensical flaws, of course. Wes Bentley's character is killed off way to quickly and anticlimactically because emotional plot point. The one equation to save humanity is a mere deus ex machina McGuffin. It's not explained in any plausible, scientific manner; we just have to roll with it. And dat Anne Hathaway doe. So melt-your-face-off- brilliant in ""Les Miserables,"" yet so full of nothing in this. Dr. Brand has gumption written into her, but Hathaway can't infuse enough life into a character with no compelling purpose or motivation beyond blah-blah-save-the-human-race-blah-blah-love-conquers-all.

It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as ""a film that rewards intellect"", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.  "

120708,tt0477348,abeach09,united states,5,"Good for the action, but terrible ending","At first, I thought this was a pretty good movie. I was entertained for most of it with good action scenes and was on the edge of my seat for a couple seats because of the suspense. However, once the movie ended I just gave a big ""WHAT?"" Did they seriously just end the movie like that? I do not understand how a writer could go through an entire movie about one plot of a guy chasing another guy...and then just end it with the cop who did nothing throughout the whole movie talking about his dream. Now I was trying to think about the symbolism behind the last scene and the only thing I could think of was that the dream signified that Tommy Lee Jones knew that the killer was coming for him next. He retired because he knew there was no use looking for the killer anymore because he was going to come after him. But in a movie like this, I don't think that is an effective ending. This wasn't some crappy multi-themed no plot movie. It had lots of action and a distinct chain of events plot and then it was ruined by the ending. Therefore, just wait til it comes to video because it is a solid movie but you are just disappointed by the ending.  "

Which is a shame, because I really really really wanted to like it. It had some interesting characters, funny interactions, and sweet effects, but ultimately failed to bring everything together in a way which made the sum meaningful. After my wife and I left the theater I was almost embarrassed to ask her what she thought--because I was afraid she was going to say what I was already feeling myself... and that after I pushed her to see the movie when she was decidedly ""meh"" after seeing the trailer. Neither of us really cared for it, and both of us were disappointed. We both walked away thinking, so this is why it doesn't make sense to go see movies in the theater anymore. You drop a lot of money to see big budget extravaganza's which ultimately fail to satisfy. It just felt like a movie which only played lip service to the characters, and dwelled on the action. For me, a lot of action has no meaning without a lot of character substance. And it's a bad sign if I find myself more interested in the ""bad guy"" winning and destroying planets, and being generally evil, than I am in the ""good guys"" saving the day. This was totally the case here. I didn't really care if the good guys won or the bad guy won. I hear they're already making a sequel. My wife and I have been burned by the first one and have little interest in more of the same. There was so much good stuff here which was squandered that it really makes me sad.  "
64595,tt0910970,abecipriano,Philippines,9,Extraordinar-E,"It took me a while to actually watch Wall-E. People told me it was boring, there wasn't much dialogue, etc., etc. So when I caught it at the tail end of its showing here in Manila a few months ago, I came in with the lowest of expectations, perhaps expecting at least the quality of animation I'm so used to seeing from Pixar as its only redeeming value. Turned out, I was wrong. Who would've thought that with little dialogue in the first third of the movie that this would actually turn out to be a richly done animated picture? While it didn't have many laughs like Kung Fu Panda or even Bolt, this picture shows that love and hope can come from anywhere at anytime. Of course, it's balanced, well-paced and it has its share of laughs. Wall-E the protagonist (he reminds me of that Short Circuit robot from the 80's movies with Steve Guttenburg) is a unique robot. He has feelings, he's sentimental, and he's a collector of old memorabilia and interesting stuff. Plus he still does his business taking out the trash and even using the junk to make replicas of buildings. Cool. Visually stunning from beginning to end, Wall-E is a masterpiece of animation and directing. In fact, the movie has a rich detail in the portraying of Earth in the distant future as well as providing an imaginative perspective of how Earthlings could have evolved given a certain path taken. That was very interesting as well. Mostly, the movie portrays a message of hope. It may seem preachy, bringing to mind a similar animated flick in Happy Feet, but it's portrayed in such a way that it's acceptable to hear and you say to yourself, ""yeah... that's right."" It's got a level that can appeal to adults as well, and it's different than many of the things we see and consider as ""entertainment."" There are countless awesome (animated) movies that I've seen through the years, but Wall-E is so different that it's got to be included in my personal collection of worth-collecting DVD's. Truly an extraordinar-E movie made by Pixar. You've got to see it!  "
116808,tt0892769,abecipriano,philippines,9,"From no expectations, to high expectations and then exceeding them","I have to admit, I didn't know anything about this movie until it started showing here in Manila around a week ago. The 3D version had just opened (if I'm not mistaken) a couple of days later and I invited my niece and nephew to watch with me (and my wife). Seeing how this was a Dreamworks movie (Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar), it was likely that I'd watch it anyway... the question is, will it be another Kung Fu Panda (which I rated a 10), or a Monsters Vs. Aliens (entertaining, but not a classic for years to come; or good enough to watch over and over again on DVD; let's face it, for every excellent Dreamworks animation like Shrek or Madagascar, there's a Shrek 2 or a Bee Movie). So I read up on reviews on a local website and on IMDb, and I was blown away by their reviews, both from critics and regular movie goers. People were generally pleasantly surprised, and enjoyed the 3D as well. So... I got all excited and had higher expectations all of a sudden. Now on to the movie. There were so many great things from this movie --- Entertainment - from a storytelling standpoint, this was up there with the best of Dreamworks animation; there was decent character development whether you empathize with the classic protagonist that's different from the rest of the Vikings or just appreciate the father and son relationship as it goes through the awkward years. The build-up from beginning to the climax was well done. There was much enjoyment all around with acceptable (and only occasional) lulls, and the lessons that can be learned were good and appreciable both from a child's standpoint and an adult's. Overall, How To Train Your Dragon (or some call it HTTYD) is a good blend of comedy, action and sprinkles of drama. After all, don't you want your animation to be a pretty good mix of everything? Animation - Breathtaking; the aerial movements, the battles, the effects were all very good; not over the top, but released in appropriate doses needed to make every scene effective, memorable and entertaining. Watching in 3D adds more texture to the surroundings, puts the right amount of action at the right times, and was so generally well done that I hope this would be the benchmark of the perfect blend of cinematography and action using this technology (okay, this is not up there with Avatar's 3D but Avatar is technically live action, not animation). 3D doesn't have to be in-your-face like the old 3D's of Jaws or the more recent not-so-impressive 3D of Ice Age, or sometimes useless 3D used during the otherwise-touching and memorable movie ""Up"" Voice actors - Okay, that the children/teenage protagonists didn't have the requisite Viking (Scottish- or Irish-like) accents was strange, but if you wave off the inconsistency and suspend your disbelief there, I can understand why some reviews said that the choice of voice actors was just right, and not over-the-top overwhelming that they begin to define the humor, and effectively take over the movie (like Robin Williams in Aladdin or Eddie Murphy in Mulan/Shrek). I was half expecting Gerrard Butler to shout his famous line from 300, but he was all right, too. So I enjoyed that, hahaha. Dragons - maybe I was half expecting the dragons to speak but then again, that would have placed it into a box... a box of the usual Hollywood animation (or even non animation in cases like Dragonheart) crap. So this was good. You could still see it in the actions and expressions of Hiccup's dragon friend, ""Toothless."" Plus they did a bang up job in portraying many different kinds of dragons. I thought that was quite intelligently conceptualized and implemented perfectly, from the wart-hog looking ones, to the two headed variety, there were plenty of dragons for everyone's enjoyment. Overall, this is a must-see movie for children and those who, like me, are children at heart. I enjoyed it enough to write a review again, hoping that those who are undecided will be convinced to watch it. Please do watch it, and look for that touching scene near the end between our young Hiccup and Toothless (made my eyes welt up just a little). No regrets in watching this. Even with heightened expectations, HTTYD still blew mine out of the sky. Or should I say dragon-blasted it? :-) Now to try watching it in Imax 3D before Clash of the Titans starts next week.  "

OK now pause a minute , add all of the above to a bunch of funny clips that we all watch in the extras in the DVD version, but instead these clips are placed in the middle of intense (action/in the mood to fight) battle scenes, that will completely drop your focus, I mean just when you are starting to like the film and get into the mood and into the story you get interrupted by some stupid (I guess funny) clip that we could have avoided.

4446,tt0068646,abed-nama-92,israel,10,The acting may have been better,"The acting may have been better than the acting in the original. Robert De Niro gave a perfect subtle performance as Vito Corleone. His portrayal was powerful and breathtaking. When I think De Niro I definitely do not think subtle and smooth but that is exactly what he was in here. It is definitely one of his top three performances in his career. The depth in his portrayal was able to justify the Vito Corleone that Marlon Brando portrayed in the first. Al Pacino gave a very strong performance playing Michael Corleone. In here we get to see more of the tough decisions that have to be made and the consequences of certain actions. Al Pacino perfectly displayed the amount of thought and struggle that goes into and comes out of every action you make; the way it affects relationships, family, power and influence. Diane Keaton was not really given a lot of room to act in the first but in here she is very good. She did not play the stereotypical wife who always stands behind her husband but rather the woman with a mind of her own who is willing to go after what she feels she deserves. Robert Duvall again to me was the glue to the movie. Just having him in there kind of makes you feel safe. John Cazale also had more of an impact in here than in the first playing the half-witted brother always needing to be bailed out. A lot of these characters sound so familiar and stereotypical but in The Godfather Part II every character is played out with such extraordinary depth. Everyone from Talia Shire who gave a fine performance to Lee Strasberg all the way down to the kid who played young Vito Corleone were perfect. Part II seems to me to be more of a character study than the original. "

Neither am I a big comic books fan. Batman Begins just seemed like an entertaining way to spend a summer evening, and with a slew of semi-disappointing action movies recently the expectations weren't running too high. However, even if they were, BB would have surpassed them. Finally there's an action movie where there is more to watch then CG special effects. The story is captivating and deep, and the acting is fantastic. While we expect it to be so from the likes of Christian Bale and Liam Neeson, the biggest surprise for me was Cillian Murphy as Scarecrow. Throughout the entire movie the storyline, if not completely realistic, is at the least plausible, and never cartoonish, even in its depiction of villains. In BB you get a great dark multifaceted drama, and the action component is a terrific compliment to it. Even after two-and-a-half hours I did not want the movie to end. I Hope that there are more movies like this one to look forward to from DC comics, and hopefully the same brilliant cast and production team.  "

Not Batman movies with action in them. I really enjoyed the Tim Burton movies because they had both the look, feel and characters of the comics and the Batman universe, where the new ones a basic Hollywood action (with better acting than the common blockbuster though) with Batman as almost the lead.

The script is solid enough to cover for Keanu's acting pitfalls and keep the audience into the plot. It also does a great job of keeping a very complicated story simple. One can walk away from this movie for up to 40 minutes, come back, and still be able to follow what is going on. Some may look at this as a negative, but it is essential for a action film to be easy to follow and pick up quickly. Its like History class in school. If your off in one chapter, it wont kill you, you can pick it up right at the next chapter. A very entertaining and exciting film, although the sequels are a bit of a disappointment (especially in plot) they become far to complicated and far too dependent of CGI.

The Movie immediately starts off with a bang, with a wild knife fight between Fox and Thurman. Then, as Tarantino loves so much to do, the movie takes an out of order hour+ long detour explaining the shtick(or plot) of the movie. While some of this excursion is a little boring, or a little disturbing, any points lost are more than made up for in the end. An epic fight sequence stacking Thurman up against over 88 bad guys(and girls) in black, in a fight scene in which over 100 gallons of fake blood was used. This fight is in my opinion far and away the best part of the film, with such excessive gore that it is funny. While Kill Bill, isn't quite as solid as Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction as far as plot is concerned, you should not leave the theater disappointed.   "

20186,tt0120737,AbeStreet,united states,9,Visually Perfect!!!," Once again I find myself leaving a review for a film that has so many reviews that it is unlikely that many will see it. The reason I am leaving it is because this film is so good on so many levels. First let me begin by informing readers that I have been a fan of Tolkein and his Middle Earth since I was about 8 years old and saw the television version of THE HOBBIT. As a child I was drawn to the story line and fantasy world so much that while in grade school I read THE HOBBIT and while in junior high school read THE LORD OF THE RINGS. This was one of my first introductions into Fantasy based books. I am not a big fan of Fantasy based books and that's basically because it seems to me that most other authors have plots so similar to LOTR that I get bored and would rather read LOTR. Two exceptions would be the authors C.S. Lewis and Terry Brooks, although I think it's safe to say that Brooks's material borrows heavily from Tolkein. One draw back to Tolkein is that I, especially when I was younger, found it hard not only to pronounce some of the names that he uses for people, places and things but I found it hard to follow the story line because I would become confused while reading. The film eliminates this problem. It is so much easier to follow the story line while hearing the proper names used effortlessly.  I think that this film gives the viewer an excellent depiction of what middle earth would look like. The scenery is beautiful. I found towns such as Hobbiton and the Shire more beautiful and real than I had imagined. I especially liked Rivendale(sp) the elvish town. I did enjoy the fight between Saruman and Gandalf. Seeing these two wizards duke it out with such power despite their frail appearances was a visual treat. Of course the story has been altered and but not to the point where it detracts from the original story or alters the meaning or ending of the story. I read one review that indicated the movie left us hanging and should have bought some sort of conclusion to the ending so that if the viewers who are unable or choose not to see the following films would not be left hanging. If that reviewer had read LOTR he/she would know that the books don't bring an kind of conclusion until the end of RETURN OF THE KING. In fact I don't know how this movie could have had a clear cut ending without ruining the story line. What I like about this movie trilogy is that all 3 parts were made back to back unlike the original STAR WARS trilogy that spanned over 6 years. By filming it this way LOTR ensures that it's actors won't noticeable age or in case of some of the elder cast die before the series can be completed. Also, all 3 movies will be released within a 3 year time frame. Even though it may seem like a long time it's a lot better than waiting 3 years between sequels like SW. Lastly, LOTR has just been nominated for many Oscars this year. I personally would love to see it get best picture and director. My guess is that the academy will give the director award to Ron Howard for A BEAUTIFUL MIND. I believe this will happen because he has been nominated several times before and the academy will figure he is due an award. However, given LOTR fan base, excellent box office receipts and almost universal praise from fans and critics I don't see how they can not give it to LOTR. If it should win Best Picture this would represent a win for director Jackson in case he is passed over for Best Director and it would honor and pay tribute to Tolkein the ""father"" of modern mythology and fantasy.

49172,tt0047396,AbeStreet,united states,10,There is a little bit of L.B. Jefferies in all of us!," It is easy to see why this film made AFI's top 100 list. In this review I will explain why I feel that this film is one of the best ever and compare it to other well known Hitchcock films. Spoilers are contained in the review. I first saw REAR WINDOW (RW) in 1984 at the age of 15. It was during this time that several of Hitchcock's films were being re-released in theaters. I had recently discovered reruns of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS (AHP) on tv and had a budding interest in all things Hitchcock. I had of course seen movies such as PSYCHO (P) and THE BIRDS (TB)but knew little of his other work. I had the opportunity to see the 1956 remake of THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (TMWKTM56)with Jimmy Stewart at the theater. I enjoyed this film more than any other Hitchcock film I had seen to date. A few months later I tried to rent a copy of the film but the video store did not have a copy. The video clerk suggested I may enjoy RW instead. I looked at the box and saw that this film contained Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, whom I had recently saw on tv in DIAL ""M"" FOR MURDER (DMFM), and figured why not. This suggested rental was probably the best movie tip I have ever been given. I watched this film several times. Initially I thought the film moved at a much slower pace, especially when compared to TMWKTM56, and the same set throughout the movie was a bit boring. However, I rewatched the film and found that I began to identify with L.B. Jefferies (J. Stewart) as he looked in on his neighbors. After all who hasn't stared at his/her neighbors as they argue or as furniture is moved in or guests pull up and enter their home. We all do! Unlike Hitchcock's other heros that spend the film darting around from place to place while they romance the girl they've abducted to help them as they clear their names L.B. Jefferies is a man we can all relate to. He has been bed ridden due to an injury and is bored. As such he begins to spy on neighbors to pass the time. I think any person would have done what he did. L.B. also struggles with the fact that he is dating and loves a woman who has a career, makes more money than him. For the most part this aspect of dating was not a real issue until post WWII when women began to move into the male dominated work area. I think many men and women can appreciate how this aspect of the movie relates to the dating scene more and more, especially when viewed today. Another great thing about this film is how the viewers all grow to know L.B.'s neighbors. Will Ms. Lonely Hearts ever find love? Will we learn who Ms. Torso really likes? Why is Harry, the newly wed, so distraught? Of course once the film is over the answers to these questions are all provided but until the end Hitchcock keeps us wondering! Thelma Ritter as the visiting nurse Stella adds her usually snappy personality and wit to the film. Lastly, this film is unlike just about any other Hitchcock film. There are no chase scenes, no graphic death scene and no fancy location shoots. It is a unique masterpiece to be enjoyed by all.   "

If there wasn't before this movie a ""mafia"" with a code of honor brought over from Sicilia to the US, this movie created it. Nowadays it's an integral part of North American folk history.   It depicts organized crime as a family, a respectable business, carried out under strict regulations, enforced out by the ""pater familia"" out of the respect, appreciation and authority gained among his extended family, ""the village"", while employing the respect others professed for him to preserve his authority, and yet, although perceived as last recourse, if necessary to keep his ""Family"", honor or authority safe, employing without hesitation blunt and unforgiving brute force was neither taboo nor regretted.   Changes in the ""Old Ways"" are about manifest as a new younger generation (US born, and no Italian immigrants) began to take over the family business and the drugs dealing business appeared in the picture ∂? before they were forbidden as the code didn't allow for indiscriminate damage to the ""Extended Family"" (their own people).  But now it was more a question of supremacy against other ethnicities (immigrants and their descendants), who were willing to sell drugs to anyone who wanted to buy, even their own people or the ""Italo-Americans"".   As they saw it, If they let them get all the pieces of this pie, the drug business which was so lucrative, they'll quickly become the most powerful and would pose a real threat to the mere existence of ""The Family"".   The youngsters didn't find a solution viable other than to break the code and start dealing with drugs (even to their own ""Extended Families"", as they reasoning was that they were going to get it anyways, it'll always be better that the business remained in ""The Family"".  From there on, although at first sight it may had seem everything continued like before, it really wasn't like that at all, something had broken at the very root of ""The Family"", it had changed forever and they were in a path of no return. Respect was slowly and continuously replaced by fear... And that was a one way ticket to a new era, the one of a Wounded to Death, Crumbling Empire.   After watching The Trilogy and the movies Goodfellas, Once Upon a Time in America, and Scarface. If you can (have the spare time), do not miss The Sopranos (the HBO TV Series) by the also great James Gandolfini.   See how a Empire can bleed to death because a wrong decision betrayed what they stood for and that changed everything so much that they lost their reason d'«¶tre. "
157253,tt0848228,abetorres83,united states,10,"Wonderful, Amazing, Thrilling","The Phenomenal Avengers Today I watched ""The Avengers"" for the first time. The movie itself, I believe was very well put together. Not knowing who each character is and not seeing each one of their movies to get their background. The movie was well put together, that I understood what role each one played. With the original cast of each character are in this movie, except they did not use the original actor for the Hulk which is what I was familiar with but the part was very well portrayed by Mark Raffalo . The Hulk character keeps the viewers on edge, wondering what or when will he release the rage of The Hulk. The movie starts with that main villain Loky, god of mischief, planning one of his ultimate plans of taking over the world. The original actor, Tom Hiddleston, from the movie "" Thor"" plays an amazing part both dark and evil. Capturing all the characteristics of a grand villain, comes to life in the amazing film and Hiddleston plays the part to perfection. Other characters in this film include the fantastic performance of Chris Evans as Captain America. With his honor and loyal traits this character is incredibly brought to the screens with a perfect actor that does its great justice. All the characters in this film are portrayed wonderfully to bring this fantasy film to life. This movie also shows the truth of a community in a tragedy. When all hope is lost in the movie each character mad at each other in regular life come together to get through the hard times and defeat the powerful Loki. This is film each actor feeds each other in this film that all the scenes connect perfectly and even if you have not seen all the individual movies of all the characters one by one. The film is still pretty easy to follow and to catch up on each one and the part they play. All and all I would like to say that Joss Whedon did an amazing job on creating each character and I hope there is more to come. Two thumbs up in my book∂?.ART  "
5381,tt0071562,abettertomorrow,new zealand,10,The best made film of the 70s," While the first Godfather introduced us to a very powerful family and the way they protect their legacy, the second is about how that family builds and protects it's future. Vito Corleone (De Niro) builds it's future while Michael Corleone (Pacino) protects it. By showing father and son doing this, they also show the contrast in character between the two. The film shows that while Vito had a very strong, ambitious character, Michael showed equal strength but underneath he hid sadness and depression.  Of course, a complex character comparison/contrast like this needs great actors to fulfill the job. Al Pacino, fresh from his Oscar-nominated turn in The Godfather delivers one of his most memorable performances while Robert De Niro, a relative unknown then delivers an Oscar-winning performance. The two intercuts between Michael and Vito motionless is probably the most memorable images of The Godfather trilogy and shows what 'star power' really is. Other than De Niro/Pacino, Robert Duvall - one of the greatest character actors of the century - delivers yet another strong performance while the late John Cazale represents the price of power in a masterful, haunting performance.

37274,tt0114814,abettertomorrow,new zealand,10,Gets Better With Age [*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*]," The first time I saw this film was 4 years ago, when it first came out on video. I saw it because of the unbelievable praise it was given by its audience, about half of its film critics, and its two Academy Awards. After I finished the film I was both shocked and confused as to what had happened. It seemed to me everything Verbal had said to Dave Kujan was false, or some of it false, and the only confirmed truthful events or persons we actually see during the course of the film is the setup (or lineup), Verbal's testimony to the DEA, the death of the suspects except Verbal, Verbal's lies to Kujan, Kobayashi's existence, and of course the fact Keyser Soze is Verbal Kint (or could Kobayashi be Soze?)... This all took hours to figure out, but then I thought, the movie is rubbish..it just cheats at the end. Months later The Usual Suspects was screened on TV. I gathered the will to watch it again, and I watched it with the knowledge of what happens at the end. I learned SO much more. So many little details (like the history of Keyser Soze and Dean Keaton, and their questionable past relationship or rivalry). Also, I appreciated the movie for what it is before the twist at the end: a clever, mysterious noir with great music, editing, script, characters and acting. But I still didn't fully understand the ending and its link to the flashbacks. If everything which Verbal said was shown in the flashbacks, why did Verbal admit to killing the man with the case who Keaton couldn't kill? Wouldn't that make Verbal a confessed murderer (he got set free after his testimony)? This is probably the only mysterious flaw(?) of the film. After the second viewing, I watch the film every two or three months when I have the time. EACH time I learn something refreshingly new. This must be one of the most carefully constructed films of alltime. When you think about it the film was giving you as many clues as to who Keyser Soze really is as as many tricks to making you think Keaton is Soze: 1) the order of the gifts to the five guys from Kobayashi, and the way the camera never shows what was in Verbal's package 2) the tone of voice and the evil look Verbal gives in the lineup scene 3) the misleading, obviously tricky way the film always depicts Verbal as the last guy who could be Soze (the weasel/cripple character, the constant jokes (""gimp, pretzel man"") made towards Verbal. 4) Verbal's crippled hand/leg sometimes changes from left to right throughout the film. 5) ""Soz"" in Turkish means word. Word and verbal a connection anyone?? If you haven't seen the film, you shouldn't be reading this.. But if you have and couldn't understand it, read my post and see it again and again!  "

I have never had the feeling of anger and of having been robbed of my time and money as I had after watching this movie, and I don't think that I was alone as I heard someone in the audience say that he would never watch another movie in the cinema ever again. The film is very violent but in a boring, casual mind-numbing kind of way and I think that a lot of the people who have written positive reviews for this film have got caught up in the whole Coen brothers mythology. If it had been made by Joe Shmo it would have passed unnoticed.This film is even worse than Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and that's saying something!  "

42489,tt0120586,abfacebookab,united states,7,Very good movie? yes. Instant classic? no.,"This is a response to some negative reviews. Some people were wondering how Derek, a supposedly smart kid was influenced only by his dad's one remark. Though the movie did not explicitly say this, I believe it is after his father died that he met Cameron, who became a father figure to Derek, and with his constant propaganda began to change Derek's mind and overwhelm the opinions of his family. Another question is why the African-American kid kills Danny at the end for seemingly nothing but blowing smoke in his face. Again it is implied that this is not their first interaction, and with Danny's opinions probably made very public, there was probably growing tensions between them, that with the smoke just put him over the edge, not to mention the African-American kid was also in a gang that was probably fighting with the white supremacist group Danny and Derek were a part of. This gang was also probably responsible for trying to kill Cameron and Seth at the end. Also, the ""change of heart"" that Derek had did not take place in 2 days like some reviewers are saying. Remember that Derek saw dealings he didn't like between his group and the minority groups in prison, this lead to tensions between him and the group which lead to him being raped in the shower. This combined with the growing relationship between him and the African-American he was working with and Sweeney's guidance were all factors in changing his attitude. Remember this was based on a true story so these events are not all bullshit. I do agree that some of the editing and stylistic choices weren't the best (ie the slow motion and could have explained things more clearly with more scenes). However it was still a very powerful movie.  "
75,tt0111161,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,5,"Tedious, overlong, with ""hope"" being the second word spoken in just about every sentence... who cares?","I simply fail to understand how this film is so popular... it's quite simply beyond me. The only way I can explain it is that all the fans of King's short story found it very true to the spirit of the book, and voted 10 for that. I really could not find anything worth my time in this film, and apart from a very good monologue from Freeman near the end, one or two good lines of dialog and the acting, there's really nothing in the whole film worth watching it for. It's about hope... and the director won't let us forget it, so it's repeated until the audience mumbles it in our sleep. It's like this short, one-note story was written, and the author just didn't want to end it... so he kept writing... and writing... until someone had the sense to break down the door and wrestle the pen from him yelling ""for the love of all that is holy, stop writing!"" And I thank that faceless man for doing that, because it is undoubtedly the only reason the film was 142 minutes long, and not 284, or, dare I say it, 568. The film simply drones on and on, scene after scene, containing nothing remotely interesting(but with excellent acting, mind you). There's nothing good about this film except for the acting. Just about all of it is great. I can't really think of anything else to say... I guess my dislike for the film stems from my hatred of King's writing. I suppose it is possible for someone who is neutral on his works to enjoy this film. I recommend this to fans of Stephen King, the actors and possibly Frank Darabont. If you're not a fan of any of these people, I doubt you'd find this enjoyable. 5/10 "
4649,tt0068646,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Definitely deserves its high rating," I haven't seen all dramas, nor have I ever seen all movies made that revolve around the mafia, but this is the best drama I've ever seen, and the best movie that revolves around the mafia, by far. Marlon Brando is a fantastic actor, and while I haven't seen any other films with him, I can't imagine that he's done much better work than he did in this film. Al Pacino was also great in the film, and I think it was fairly early in his career. The film is character and plot driven, which is a welcome change from the action-driven films which is the dominant genre today. The film is never predictable, and is free from the typical cliches that pester most dramas. For a crime drama, it's very entertaining and interesting, for a drama, it's very well-paced, and for a film it's just damn good in pretty much every way. The plot is good, very well-written and interesting; I don't think I've ever payed so much attention to a drama, let alone one that takes almost three hours. It just grabbed my attention from the very first frame, the very first words that were spoken caught my attention, and didn't lose it for a second. It has a good pace, it doesn't rush through the scenes, yet it never gets stale or boring either. The acting is great, all the way around, every single actor does a great job. There weren't any that I felt gave a less than great performance. The characters were well-written, credible and well-developed. There weren't any of the characters that I felt I knew too little of, like it is with most new films, even dramas. The direction and editing is great, some of the cinematography is magnificent. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has some very quotable and memorable lines. The violence is well-made and not overdone in any way; it shows the ruthless killings that were, in fact, being committed by the mafia at the time period that the film takes place in. The film shows, with brutal honesty and without censoring details or violence, how the mafia worked, and how big their influence was in the 1940's. A truly great piece of cinema, worth your time if you have at least a vague interest in crime dramas or films dealing with the mafia. I recommend it to pretty much everyone, especially fans of any of the actors, the director or crime dramas. Also recommendable to anyone who is interested in mafia films. 10/10 "
5280,tt0071562,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"About as good as the first one, but mainly because of De Niro"," It's rare to see a sequel that is as good as the first; it's even rarer to see the two acting veterans, De Niro and Pacino, together in a film. This is the only film that delivers both. I loved the first Godfather film, for it's acting talent, for it's cinematography, and for it's fantastic story. The acting is every bit as great, and the cinematography is about as good, but the story wasn't exactly as good as the first; had it not been for the flashbacks that showed Vito as young(beautifully portrayed by De Niro), it wouldn't have gotten a perfect rating from me. He saved the film, that was otherwise slow and a little bland, due to the story not being as great as the first. The first showed us a mafia war; this just shows the aftermath, and Michael Corleone's further rise to power, after the fall of Vito in the first. However, the film has a number of flashbacks, that show us Vito as young, and here De Niro perfectly shows us the entire range of his talents, by mimicking Brando's performance to perfection. The plot is good, but not as good as the first; it's saved by the flashback sequences that show us how and why Vito Corleone came to power. The acting is every bit as great as the first. Al Pacino still gives a great performance, like he did in the first, and the other cast members who came back from the first, including Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton, also give as great performances as they did in the first. The new actors also give great performances, though the following stand out as the best; Robert De Niro, Lee Strasberg and Michael V. Gazzo. The characters are as well-written as they were in the first. The mafia is portrayed as menacingly in this as it was in the first. The film, like the first, has it's share of memorable quotes, but not really any scenes that were memorable, like the first one had. All in all, a great film, but mainly because of De Niro and Pacino. De Niro fills Brando's part fairly well, but overall, the film isn't as entertaining and exciting as the first, though it does reach about the same quality overall. I recommend it to fans of the various actors involved, and of course anyone who enjoyed the first, as they should enjoy this one too, but possibly to a lesser extent. 10/10 "
9622,tt0468569,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Honestly, even with the flaws, this is amazing","Obviously this has been extremely hyped. And while the overall reception is positive, there are those that hate this. I have no problem with these people, and I won't claim that this is all the way perfect - one can wonder if any film could truly be - but this does have undeniably impressive aspects. This is an excellent movie, and not only for being based on graphic novels. The psychology is magnificent, and goes far beyond the one-note ""fear"" approach of the first. It can be argued how close it all is to the comics, however, a lot of the tone and concept comes through, and will be accessible to the majority of viewers. Is this not the most intimidating and strongest portrayal of The Joker on the big screen(and the idea behind him is interesting)? Ledger(R.I.P.) disappeared into the performance, and one can understand why it might have affected him personally. The acting, in general, is impeccable. Bale(in spite of having utterly and completely forgotten how to do the voice of the black-clad vigilante...?), Caine, Freeman, Oldman all do great, again. Gyllenhaal was a good replacement for Holmes. Eckhart is spot-on. The complexity of this is admirable. The amount of plot, that one can actually still follow it all, and that it all comes together with nothing going underdeveloped or unused is astounding. The surprises work enormously well. Granted, not everything remains entirely credible. The effects are marvelous. The comedy works well, few jokes fall flat. The dialog is well-written and delivered equally well. The action is awesome, and it does not take over, the focus is still on the material and what is explored, not what gets blown up or who has a fight scene. Might I add, Nolan got better at shooting it, it never looks bad in this, and tends to be exciting and engaging. The music is well-composed, and it stays enough in the background as to not detract from the whole. There is a little moderate language, no sexuality, and quite a few disturbing sights, sounds and thoughts. The DVD has extras, including featurettes(oddly devoid of talking heads, done more with still shots with the crew and/or Christopher talking over them) dealing with the IMAX cameras, the score and others, photo galleries, trailers and TV-spots. I recommend this very warmly to any fan of Batman, the director and/or anyone else involved in making this. 10/10 "

One man stands against the rest and argues that he may not be. In the 90 minutes that follow, this goes into these twelve individuals, and we see how peer pressure and personal prejudices can sway decisions that ought not to be taken lightly. This is a masterpiece, and it is so on account of all the elements being carefully crafted, each excellent on their own, and the mix of them all being so seamless. Every character(they are the focus of this, if the well thought out case itself does get a lot of attention as well) and the script is well-written, developed impeccably and credible. This is quite realistic, and what flaws there are were possibly conscious decisions for the dramatic effect(it is not a documentary, nor was it meant to be), and do not take away from the whole. The acting is perfect for all concerned. This is carried by dialog and marvelous speeches, with no flashbacks and essentially only one setting(albeit the cinematography makes full use of it, so no claustrophobia is induced). The camera stays on the people, follows them, remains on them for reactions when someone else suddenly speaks, and there are long takes. Editing is impossibly subtle. You forget that it's a movie. Instead, you find yourself experiencing this tense situation with them. A dozen men in a locked room, determining if someone lives or dies. This raises questions about the legal system, as well. Other than Serpico, I haven't seen anything by Lumet, but Dog Day Afternoon is on my list of ones to get. There is some mildly disturbing content and a few instances of moderate language in this. The DVD comes with the original trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10 "

The perfectly accurate depiction of the persecution and execution of Jews is indeed heartbreaking and moving. The portrayal of Schindler, who transforms from being a cold, egotistical, greedy bastard, who only cared about making money, profit, into a selfless, giving person who worked very hard, and gave everything to save as many people as he possibly could. The film also perfectly and chillingly depicts how the Nazi's threw the Jews around, shoving them around, shooting them if they felt like it, for no reason. The film has a great cinematography, that really captures the intensity of the situations and scenes. The plot is good, and moves along at a good pace, though it will test your patience if you aren't interested in the subject of the film (though I don't really see why anyone wouldn't be, at the very least, interested). The acting is all great, by every single actor, but the one I really noticed was Liam Neeson, who portrays Oskar Schindler, a character who undergoes a major development through the film. The script is good, as it allows the audience to see an accurate depiction of just about every single situation that Jews were in, during the war. It is a depressing film, yes, and a sad one, since it tells a very disturbing story, but it should be seen by just about anyone who can sit through it(it does have some violent scenes, but nothing very graphic), as it is a very important and beautiful movie. Any person who considers him or herself to be literate and intelligent should see this movie at least once. You don't get a more accurate portrayal of the horror of being a Jew during that time than this. I recommend this movie to anyone who can sit through it, both concerning the length and the violence in it. 10/10   "

I decided to rate it a 5, since that seems to be the sensible thing to do in this situation. Like a few others have said, Tarantino's style is hip and makes you, the audience, feel hip. The dialog, the editing, the violence... the problem is, it's empty. The dialog is entirely superficial, which is OK if there's not too much of it or what there is there to be superficial. But here it carries half of the scenes. The dialog scenes(as pretty much everything else in the film) is very dull, visually. The camera doesn't move and rarely changes angle, and it's something that'll make you fall asleep, if the pointless, shallow dialogs don't do so first. The editing is daft as well. The violence is so over the top that you almost have to be mentally disturbed not to be affected(read: repulsed) by it... is that why it's there? Does Tarantino want to gross out his audience? Is that what it's about? The length and pace is horrible. I don't believe I've ever managed to sit through the entire thing attentively. The problem is not the length itself as much as what appears to be Tarantino yelling at his audience ""You want to see my movie? Well, you better prepare to sit there for what feels like 10 hours straight!"" Just to ensure that there are no misunderstandings; that was a metaphor. Tarantino doesn't *actually* yell at the audience. It just feels like it. The whole film feels like it's trying to get somewhere, to say something, but then the film is over, and it forgot to tell us what it was. The film is anticlimactic throughout(quite an achievement... usually only the end of a film is anticlimactic), and when it's done, you'll be saying to yourself ""That's it? What the heck was all that hype about?"" The truth is, in my opinion, a small group of Tarantino fans got together, and started 'converting' anyone they could find to love the film, and suddenly, this had taken over the general opinion on the film. Everybody thinks it's great, but no one can really explain why. I have yet to meet someone who've explained why Tarantino's films supposedly are great. Now don't get me wrong; I don't have anything against the guy. I like several of his films; Jackie Brown, From Dusk 'Till Dawn and Kill Bill 1&2. The problem here is that the film lacks any real substance. None of the characters are likable, not even slightly. They are killers, drug-dealers, psychos and morons. The film has the typical non-linear time-line which Tarantino utilizes in virtually all of his films. However, here it seems redundant, like it was just tagged on for no actual reason. Both volumes of Kill Bill were great because of good use of this; Pulp Fiction is not, because of the use of aforementioned effect is seemingly pointless here. The actors all play exactly the same type of character that they always play, with one or two possible exceptions. Samuel Jackson plays the 'violent, loud-mouthed individual with an unusual belief or philosophy' what do you know, that came right off his trademark section of his biography on this very site. John Travolta is the usual cool guy. Ving Rhames is the typical tough black guy, same as always. Do I need to go on? If you've read everything up to this point, you might think I hate this movie... I don't. I just dislike half of it. And that's just the thing... I can't entirely hate this. The scenes with Travolta and Jackson are pretty good, a few of the lines in the film are quotable, and most of the characters are well-cast. There you have it; half bad, half good. Better than Reservoir Dogs, but not as good as Jackie Brown and not even in the same league as the two Kill Bill films. I recommend this only to Tarantino junkies. Everyone should stay away, unless they are crazy about one or more actors in the film. If you do see it, only see it once and try to pay attention(even though it's really hard). 5/10  "
13483,tt0167260,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,The journey and the destination are both well worth the investment of time,"I haven't read anything by Tolkien. It is a great credit to these movies that you can watch all three without needing to have taken in the novels beforehand. This is an excellent end to an incredible trilogy. The plot is engaging from start to finish, and this moves rather smoothly, with great pacing. This is funny several times, and there is very little of the annoying(and still easily ignored) comic relief. I am thrilled to see Gollum turn out to be such a richly detailed and thoroughly developed character. The meld of live-action and CGI elements is perfect. You forget that not everything you're seeing is really there. The effects are impeccable, in general, and the imaginative designs, and boundless creativity are amazing. Creepy and dark, this isn't actually depressing, in spite of many gloomy moments. The battle sequences are intense, well-choreographed and awesome. This has astonishing editing and cinematography, and has a marvelous look. The acting doesn't let you down at any point. There is a lot of scary and disturbing content in this, and it might be too much for children. I recommend this to any fan of the fantasy genre, and, really, everyone who enjoys an appreciation for the medium of film. 10/10  "
16269,tt0060196,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,"A great western, but drags a little too much, especially on repeated viewings"," This, the third and final part of Sergio Leone's famous ""Dollars"" or ""Man with no name"" Trilogy was promised to be the epic chapter; that proves to be entirely true. However, despite Leone's talented direction, the film seems to drag in some scenes, and the length is almost unbearable on multiple viewings. The plot is very good, intricate, yet simple enough for the mainstream crowd; the way it keeps developing through twists and unexpected situations is also great. It keeps your interest, at least the first few times you see it. The pace is bad in some scenes, where the movie seems to drag on endlessly. I don't think I've been able to sit through the whole thing more than once(granted, technically that's enough, but a film should have some re-watch value, I think). The acting is very good; Clint Eastwood is the embodiment of the spaghetti-western spirit. Lee Van Cleef is excellent as well, as is Eli Wallach. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. The direction is, as always when it comes to Leone's films, excellent. Apart from the few scenes where the plot drags, Leone keeps a great atmosphere and mood throughout the film. The action is about as good as it gets when it comes to spaghetti-western: excellent, intense and very, very cool. The dialog is excellent. The script is well-written. The soundtrack is among Ennio Morricone's best work. All in all, if you're into westerns at all, this is pretty much *the* western. It drags a little too much in a few scenes, though, and is probably best enjoyed if you only see it once. I recommend it to any fan of westerns, particularly spaghetti-westerns, as well as any of the three main actors, or Sergio Leone. 9/10   "
18664,tt0137523,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Interesting and unsettling, possibly David's finest hour","I haven't read the novel, nor do I know how good this is compared to it, but the author has said that this made him ashamed of the book, which can only really be a positive thing in this case. It's quite difficult to comment on this without giving something essential away. Being a fan of David Fincher and having heard nothing but positive reviews for this film, I eventually bought it. Having just finished it, it's hard to determine what to think of it. I had kind of heard the twist already, and I picked up on many of the hints towards it, so that had less(but still some) effect on me... I urge anyone who is even considering watching this to forget everything they've heard about it, look at no promotional material and just get, borrow or rent a copy of it and see it for yourself, without trying to figure out how it's going to end. The plot is intelligent, and very stylishly told. The whole production has an edge to it, but doesn't come off as pretentious. The satire and critique in the movie is smart, but it should perhaps be noted that no arguments are presented for the opposing view. The acting is all excellent. The visuals are slick and often undeniably disturbing. The whole thing has a rather dark tone. The cinematography is grand. The soundtrack fits like a glove for every scene. The dialog is clever and in-your-face. I've heard it said that this inspires anarchy and violence... that may be. But just because art is misunderstood does not mean it should not be made. Creative expression is one of the few things that make man great. Magnificent work, Mr. Fincher... keep it up. 10/10  "
18876,tt0120737,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,I was not in the target audience,"I have never read a single word of anything by Tolkien. This is not my genre; I have always disliked fantasy, and largely, adventure, as well. Prior to my viewing of this, I didn't care for Jackson, although The Frighteners had its moments. I put off watching this until tonight, where it was on TV. In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant. There is nothing really offensive in this, though children might find the battle sequences too intense. I recommend this to everyone who can see themselves getting into this. 10/10  "
23206,tt0080684,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,The best of all six,"Where the first was an introduction to this vast universe, this is a further adventure in it, and an expansion of it. New worlds, creatures and technologies. Like its predecessor, this has something for everyone, and this is a stronger film... perhaps the most so, of the entire series. Kershner is undoubtedly at least part of the reason... he worked to make the characters realistic and credible beyond what they were, and it pays off. The various relationships are more believable than in the others, and the developments are very natural. This offers an emotional connection to the material, for the viewer, in addition to all the entertaining aspects. The plot remains interesting throughout and it never stands still. The pacing is spot-on, there isn't a boring moment in the two hour running time. The effects are impeccable, and Lucas had the crew push themselves to the limit, and it shows... big time. The score is yet again fantastic, Williams adds to what he created for IV. The acting is good, and seldom poor. The tone gets darker, setting up a sequel. The episode before this was a solid story even if it would be the only in the franchise, and this is a perfect middle part. This has by far the greatest light-saber action in the Original Trilogy. This is exciting and masterful with dialog and tension of high quality. The DVD features a commentary track well worth a listen, with several speakers, including Irvin. I recommend this to fans of Star Wars(regardless of what exactly you take that to mean), science fiction and movies. 10/10  "
26755,tt1375666,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Won't leave your mind anytime soon,"I went into this with high expectations and was still really impressed. This is one of Nolan's best, up there with The Dark Knight. With that said, I have to tell you that not everyone is going to love this. It's an allegory, if a subtle one. Brilliant and thought-provoking. It somehow also pretty much works as a Summer blockbuster, as it is quite intense and exciting. There is ""room"" for both aspects, and I would say that you might be satisfied if you are going for just one or the other, not both. It explores existentialism and psychology remarkably well, the philosophy especially; probably the greatest I've seen in a film(particularly for a mainstream movie). This is visually stunning, without that ever taking over. The FX are amazing, the animated things feel like they have weight to them. This does take concentration and attention, and it is fairly complex. You should know the gist of the ideas before going into it(Sartre, Plato, Kierkegaard). This is the first entirely original work by Christopher in ten years, and yes, it does bear similarities to The Matrix(and others like it)(note that this does not have the stylization or the John Woo-like approach to the gunfights and such that the Wachowski's trilogy does). That's because they are partially about the same thing. In 1999, that revolutionized science fiction. Honestly, I think we are witnessing the same with this. If you are looking for a surreal picture about dreams, this, overall, is not quite it... Mulholland Drive, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Science of Sleep are all excellent and *are* what you want. This isn't out to be as imaginative or otherworldly as those, and there is a reason for that. It is structured well, everything is set up and pays off. This explains the rules and then gives us an adventure in the universe it has created. The plot was successfully kept a secret... all I will say is that there are people who can enter others' subconscious. This is a psychological thriller. There is action, and it is well-choreographed, if awkwardly shot(on account of the director... it doesn't ruin it). The editing and cinematography are otherwise marvelous, building the atmosphere they need to. Everyone is well-cast and deliver solid performances. The characters are likable and them and their relationships are sufficiently(only a few of them thoroughly) developed and come across as natural. A little of the humor is slightly off, but not enough to be a bother, it doesn't try too hard, and this can certainly make you laugh. The ending is fantastic. Honestly, there is a reason this has been so well-received... it's #3 on the Top 250 as I type this. There is plenty of mild violence in this(actually, you can clearly tell that it was toned down to get a PG-13, here and there, on occasion, it can be hard to make out what happens). I recommend this to anyone who... uh... is currently breathing. Yeah. If you don't want to think(and you didn't like the green-tinted search for The One), or 148 minutes in a row is excessive, I guess you'll want to pass. If not, do yourself a favor. This is a debate-starter. 10/10  "
27006,tt0167261,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Raises the bar,"This might actually be a little better than The Fellowship of the Ring. There is less annoying comic relief, and, as you probably already know, we get to really *see* Gollum, in all his fully rendered, entirely CGI glory. This was probably one of the first times such a large role was so successfully entirely digital, and definitely that it had such an impact. You feel for him, and you frankly forget that he's not ""really"" there. He can also be kind of funny. The humor in general is good. This picks up where the first one left off, and with several nifty surprises(for those not familiar with the novels, or who haven't had it spoiled) along the way, the plot progresses nicely. The pace is smooth, and this doesn't seem as if it actually is the three hours long that it is. This creates moods well, being creepy, light, gloomy, etc. at different points. The action and battle sequences are exciting and awesome, not to mention well-choreographed. Every acting performance is spot-on. Even baby-face Wood and dull Bloom are impeccable. The effects are astonishing. This has an epic scope, and has a magnificent, grand score. The characters are interesting and credible. This leaves you wondering what will happen next, and I'm very much looking forward to catching the last one. There are scary scenes in this, and it might be beyond what some children can handle. I recommend this to anyone that can imagine liking it, and who have watched the first one. 10/10  "
28551,tt0073486,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Touching and moving, a great cinematic experience","Jack Nicholson is a great actor. No, not a great actor, a spectacular actor. This is a film from fairly early in his career, as well as it is for several other actors in this film, who later have had long, great careers too, including Danny DeVito, Christopher Lloyd and Brad Dourif. The film has some unforgettable moments... who could forget Louise Fletcher's icy stare, Jack Nicholson's smart-aleck remarks or Will Sampson's impressive, almost entirely silent performance? The film portrays the horrible truth about how patients were treated in mental institutions back then, and tells the story of someone who desperately wanted to break out, to rebel, to change things, for himself and for the others. I was compelled by this film, from the very first frame. I never took my eyes off it, and I will definitely be thinking about this film for a while. I thought it was great the way one of the very first frames depicted the institution as something far more similar to a prison than a hospital. Milos Forman did a great job of making that contrast very powerful to the viewer. The film is very moving and a truly beautiful cinematic experience. Every single actor gives a stellar performance, every single character is perfectly written, every single line, every single frame is absolutely perfect. I wouldn't change a thing in this film. It has a great pace, you never lose interest, but it never seems to be rushing to get through it, either. It's simply perfect. I have not read the original book, but if I ever come across it, I might check it out. I have only seen this film once, but I will definitely watch it many times in years to come. I recommend this amazing piece of great cinema to anyone who has at least a slight interest in the drama genre, or any fan of any of the actors, as they are all in their absolute prime in this film. 10/10  "
29607,tt0099685,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Impeccably well-done,"This review is based on the 2-Disc Special Edition release. I haven't read the novel, nor do I know anything about Hill that this film didn't tell me, but I understand that that this is a faithful adaptation, and that both give an honest recounting of his life. This can perhaps best be described as a portrayal of the environment, showing good and bad alike. The glamorous nature of that way of life is put up on the screen, and you definitely understand its appeal. Scorsese doesn't fail us for a second of this. It is brutal, funny, charming, bloody, intense and entertaining. The writing is excellent. Narration as well as dialog are incredible and highly memorable and quotable. The plot is interesting and develops nicely. Strong storytelling is one of the things that keeps you watching. The characters and personalities is another. Cinematography and editing are top-notch. The scoring is spot-on, with every music piece being fantastic and fitting(directly or ironically) at the same time. Every single acting performance is perfect, not only Liotta, Pesci and of course DeNiro. The pacing is marvelous. Mood and atmosphere are established masterfully. The language doesn't hold back, neither in tone nor in amount. There is some sexuality, not terribly graphic. Violence is unrestrained. This has disturbing content. The DVD comes with four featurettes(coming to about an hour in running time, all put together), as well as two commentary tracks... ""Cast and Crew""(self-explanatory) and ""Cop and Crook""(the actual Henry, and one of the feds who worked against the mob). All of it is worth the time. I recommend this to fans of gangster movies and/or authentic, biographical ones. Just make sure you can handle it. 10/10  "
32217,tt0133093,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Could this possibly have been any better?,"I base this on the Ultimate 10-Disc Set. An entire decade after this came out, it still holds up incredibly well. It simply has so much to offer... all that food for thought, different beliefs, tons of themes that are explored and such immense room for interpretation, with very little in this being certain or definite. The plot is excellent, develops well, and combines various interesting ideas(and no, they weren't original, they weren't meant to be... this puts a lot of fascinating concepts together, and presents them all for the mainstream audience). Granted, it spawned a ton of suddenly enlightened pocket philosophers with little doubt as to their own prowess, but with anything this influential, there are going to be some negative results. The pacing is spot-on, not a moment of this is too long or overly short. The action is astounding, exciting, fun, entertaining and awesome, and they manage to do amazing and memorable sequences. No, perhaps it does not dodge all of the clich«∏s. The slow-motion(and bits clearly inspired by John Woo) and other tools appeared before this, yes, the point isn't that they were new... it's the way this uses them, and creates a unique style. Mixing Noir, Anim«∏ and countless allusions, and doing so with expert-like skill is an impressive feat. The Bullet-Time was invented for this, and it is fantastic. The martial arts, the choreography, the moves, magnificent. The effects are stunning and seamless, to this day. The cinematography and editing are perfect, and enormously well-planned. The mood and atmosphere is masterfully achieved. The acting is quite good, Reeves fits, Moss and Fishburne are marvelous, and Weaving is utterly impeccable. The dialog is almost completely invariably well-written, and well-delivered. There is no nudity or sexuality, at most hints thereof. There is language, moderately harsh, albeit not too bad in frequency. The DVD holds a text introduction(to the following) by the Wachowski's, that makes for a great read, as well as two commentary tracks, one of philosophers who enjoyed the film, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who did not care for it, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. These are worth listening to. I recommend this to any fan of science fiction, and anyone who wishes to be encouraged to think by what they watch. 10/10  "
32808,tt0047478,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,"An amazing piece of film, but the length alone will discourage many possible viewers","I haven't seen any of Akira Kurosawa's other films, but I hear that this is his best, so maybe that's a good place to start(and maybe not). From the very first frame I was captivated by this film, and very interested in it. Then after about five minutes of watching, I realized how slow it was moving; ""Fine,"" I thought, ""it'll probably pick up later on"". But it didn't. The film stays in the same uncompromisingly slow pace for the entire runtime which is about three hours(more or less, depending on which cut/version you see). That's OK, don't get me wrong, but it brings the movie down. The film is epic, and truly astounding. It's a shame that it's so long and slow. The plot is great. The acting is very good, and great in some cases(for the most part, actually). The film contains a multitude of interesting, well-developed characters... but maybe that's part of the problem; there are too many of them. By the end of the film, I found myself being able to keep up with who was who, and as the credits came on, I couldn't really remember any of the names(though that may have something to do with them being in Japanese). The film has plenty of good dialog, though several of the characters spout lines that sound like they come from fortune cookies, but given just a little thought, they are quite profound. The film is called the first actual action film, due to the use of many plot points that have later ended up being clich«∏s. The film has so much going for it, but at the end, I found myself barely paying attention. Maybe the film is too long for its own good... maybe I have a too short attention spam to fully enjoy the film(which is said to be a masterpiece, which I definitely won't argue with)... I don't know. In the end, after carefully going over all of the pros and cons of the film, I find myself rating it a nearly perfect 9/10. Too many low points to it to merit a perfect 10, but far too many high points to rate it any lower, even if I didn't particularly care for the last part of the movie(which probably has more to do with my attention spam than the content of that part of the movie). The cinematography is excellent. The film is very, very well-done overall, but seems a little too long and slow, and is hurt(in any other part of the world) by the very obvious Japanese culture/nature of the film, which is a little hard to accept, especially for us Westerners. It is a great film, though, and I can't argue with its placement on the top 250 best films of all time here on IMDb(it's #5 as I'm writing this). As a final note; to anyone out there who want to see the movie but are worried about violent content: everything is only implied. Much like Hitchcock, Kurosawa obviously realized the effect of only implying violence, and as a result, most people can watch the film. Most people will probably enjoy (at least) parts of it, but I fear few will watch the whole thing through. Since I barely did so myself, I can't really say anything to keep you watching all the way through to the end; but I will say that the film is visually impressive, contains some great acting, some humane and credible characters that the audience will be able to sympathize and identify with. I recommend the film to just about anyone who is interested in watching it. However, if there are action/Samurai fans out there, craving for fight scenes and Katana action, I will say this; Look elsewhere. This has very little of such, and what there is, is only implied. Watch this movie, but watch it for the drama, not the hope of fight scenes. 9/10  "
33575,tt0076759,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,The Force *is* strong in this one... it's loved for a reason,"I think what makes this so rightfully popular is that it has something for everyone. It's fun, exciting, epic, with strong characters and clever lines. It manages to integrate all of the elements without anything feeling like it was just stuck in there, and doesn't talk down to anyone. There's no upper or lower age limit on enjoying this or taking it in. If you've got eyes and ears and you have spirit, you're likely to find at least one thing to care for in this, as well as be entertained. The plot is well-written and develops throughout. The pacing is pretty much spot-on, the movie never overwhelms or stands still. There are so many fantastic worlds, vehicles, creatures, languages and designs in the universe that this was the first look into, and it's clear that a lot of care and creativity was the basis for it. Also worth noting is the fact that this could easily be the only Star Wars to be made... it's self-contained, and had no others been done, this would still be a satisfying full story, albeit there would undoubtedly be a vocal demand for more. The action is entertaining and well-done, and certainly intense. The special effects broke new ground, actually inventing techniques for this. Some are dated, though new releases cover much up with CGI(but not to the point of it being obnoxious, or, really, particularly bothersome at all). The scope is amazing, and Lucas somehow pulled it off. The acting varies, but it's never too poor. My fianc«∏e points out that Ford does seem a tad young, considering one of the main personality traits of who he portrays. The cinematography and editing are both top-notch. The score by John Williams is incredible. The sound is unique and aids in the setting of distant planets. There is a little violence, and some disturbing visuals. The DVD holds a commentary track which makes for a good listen. I recommend this to any fan of George Lucas, adventure, science fiction and the medium of film. 10/10  "

It's a threatening, treacherous place, where innocence can only just barely survive, if at all. There are a lot of unconventional methods in this, it could perhaps even be called an experimental film, and it all pays off. The actors are unknowns, and a number of them grew up in the neighborhood this deals with. Not a single performance is lacking, and no one is miscast, and that goes for the children, too. The cinematography and editing also contain untraditional practices, and they aid in the magnificently storytelling. This is cut to evoke the frantic, gritty, and often brutal nature of the life in the slum, and it is unbelievably effective, involving and engaging. The use of music is excellent. This has strong and frequent violence and sexuality, and the language is harsh. The DVD has a well-done, 50-minute long featurette that goes into the process of making it, a nice and funny little 60-second animation, a theatrical trailer and a music video.

The suspense, the atmosphere, the gruesome theme and basic idea of a serial killer killing people by the seven deadly sins is fascinating. The plot is great, you never lose interest, and it keeps evolving for every passing minute. The pacing is great. The acting is great, the actors all do their job perfectly. The characters are believable and their actions are understandable. The whole movie is a cinematic masterpiece, and it truly deserves the praise it is getting. The ending alone has become history in modern film-making; never has an ending been more perfect, more intense or more genius. The whole movie is extremely well-thought out, but the ending alone is a masterpiece. It should be used as an example(and probably is) in film schools, to teach film students how to master true cinematic power. I recommend this to anyone who has just a little interest in thrillers, and who can take the violence. Truly a masterpiece. 10/10  "
36033,tt0102926,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"Good, but inferior to Se7en"," Hannibal Lecter. The name that will spark interest, gain recognition, and most likely send a chill down your spine. He's one of the most interesting and well-known fictional serial killers, and this is probably the movie that manages to do him most justice. Anthony Hopkins as the serial killer, psychiatrist and cannibal was a great casting decision. He definitely performed the role as perfectly as it could be done. However, when it comes to the overall quality of the film, it just doesn't entirely measure up. The plot is good, and evolves at a pretty good pace; however, I couldn't manage to sit through the entire thing... I only barely made it, half-attentive, through the first 45 minutes. I couldn't even sit through more than 3/8's of the movie, let alone the whole thing. Now, this may be because I've seen it many times in the past years, but usually, when I can't sit through a movie because I have seen it before, it's due to my remembering most of the key parts of the movie, and not being surprised by it... but not this movie; I can say, in entire honesty, that I didn't remember or even recognize any of the film, despite having seen it plenty of times before, about one time a year. If I remember anything from a movie, that I haven't seen for a long time, it's because it had an impact on me; for example, I still haven't forgotten the twist of the famous Hitchcock horror-thriller, Vertigo, despite the fact that I've seen it once, and that was about five years ago. Nothing in this movie had an impact on me, nothing affected me deeply. Maybe I'm hard to impress, maybe I am too hardened by worse films... but still. The film involves sick and disturbing characters and actions; it should have an impact on the viewer. Maybe I'm not smart enough to get it; maybe I keep expecting the film to be very different from what it was... I don't know. I just didn't find this film as good as it has been made out to be. The acting is very good; Hopkins nails the role of Lecter perfectly. Foster is good, too. Both portray their roles convincingly, and make their characters and their actions credible. The characters are well-written, credible and, well, colorful. Buffalo Bill makes a great villain, very psychotic and disturbing. Levine also gives a very good performance. All in all, a pretty good horror-thriller, but inferior to Se7en(arguably the best of the genre), and only enjoyable for people who can appreciate the psychological aspects of the film(which I guess I can't). I recommend it exclusively to people who can enjoy a very psychological thriller-horror piece. 8/10  "
36857,tt0114814,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,It all started with five guys in a lineup,"I knew the secret to this for years before I ever got a chance to watch it. That it was still immensely effective should provide an idea of how well-made this is. This was Singer and McQuarrie's second feature, together and at all, and they both do incredible in it. The direction is beyond reproach. The writing is spot-on, in all areas. The dialog, which is also well-delivered, the characters, all of them treated to perfect portrayals, and the plot, that develops impeccably. The acting is excellent, there's not a single performance that can particularly be criticized. Cinematography in this is gorgeous. The editing is sharp and marvelous. This is film-making at its finest. I understand the arguments for the twist of this being cheap, and thus the overall movie, undeserving of the praise it receives. I don't agree, however. As the ending unfolds before our eyes, the point of this becomes clear. Highly interesting use of the concept made famous on celluloid in Rash«Ômon. A certain aspect of this, I don't know if it was intentional, or a sacrifice necessary by virtue of the fact that this was made in Hollywood, and for the mainstream crowd, but while it is unfortunate, you can't have everything. There is little to no visual sexuality, various disturbing content, some relatively mild violence and plenty of strong language. I recommend this to any fan of competent thrillers and/or any of the people behind it. 10/10  "
37544,tt0118799,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,A beautiful film... but not an entirely perfect one,"When I first saw this film, I was told up front that the first full hour of the film, the first half, was all slapstick comedy and character development, and that the second half was more serious and important. I prepared myself mentally for the first half, but I was still surprised by how annoying the gags and jokes were. We're talking cake-in-face, fall-over, slip-on-banana humor. For one full hour. At the end of the first half of this film, I was thinking ""this had better get better very soon..."" And it did. Right then and there. From the very beginning of the second half, the serious mood enters. And it doesn't take long for even the most average minded viewer to realize that the first half of humor and character development was important. It was important for us to ease into a less tense mood, to make the important subject strike even harder, and for us to get to know the characters, to make us care more about what happens to them. I've just finished seeing it for the second time, and I've come to realize that this film is not entirely perfect, as I felt just after seeing it through first time. It does have its flaws, though there aren't many of them. The first half, and some parts of the second half, are heavy on humor, which some will mistake for making fun of the subject(which is almost a crime), or trying to make it seem less important. I don't believe this to be true, it's just a retelling with a more positive message; yes, people do horrible, inhumane things sometimes... but after all, there is beauty, too. The first half will also deter some viewers who will enjoy the second half much more. The plot is very good, though slightly unrealistic. The acting is pretty much all flawless, even in the child actors. The characters are well-written and interesting. The humor is more acceptable in the second part, because it's more toned down and not trying way too hard to get a quick laugh out of the audience. All in all, a great film which anyone and everyone should see at least once during their life... you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll realize that, in the end, Life Is Beautiful. I recommend this to just about anyone, but I know that not everyone will enjoy it equally. A near-perfect film. Keep watching past the first half... you won't regret it. 9/10  "
38809,tt0110413,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Good drama/action film," This film is pretty interesting; it concerns a 12-year old girl, who's entire family is killed, so she has to live with an illiterate hitman, who hates change. Both their lives change dramatically, as they have to be with a person whom they know little about, but they like each other. The plot is captivating, and very well-written. The acting is all top-notch, especially from the three main characters, played by Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman. Each of them portray their respective character to perfection. The pacing is good, there is rarely a moment in the film where you are bored. The action scenes are very well done, action-filled yet relatively realistic. Every time there is an action sequence involving Leon, the hitman, you only see him briefly, every time he kills someone. It's like being a silent spectator, seeing a professional hitman in action. Very cool. I think most people who enjoys dramas, especially dramas about love and change, will like this, though some action fans might wanna give it a shot too(no pun intended). I also recommend this to any fan of the aforementioned actors, as all of them perform very well in this movie. 10/10  "
39522,tt0245429,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Grand,"While I have not yet watched an awful lot of Anim«∏, I can say that this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. The animation is crisp and gorgeous, the style is excellent and with the right amount of motion to it, and design is impeccable, with beautiful, grotesque and amazing images presented for us to take in. Lighting and color palette are broad and well-chosen. An immense amount of imagination and creativity went into this, and you can feel it from start to finish. We are presented with a fascinating, strange world, an our trip to and around it is engaging. With a running time of just over two hours, this is the longest of its kind. However, it has spot-on pacing, never boring or overstimulating the audience members to the point where you take a break from your viewing, in spite of the odd, and once or twice even disgusting, things that this shows us. It is also open to interpretation. And in spite of that, it also tells a story so that anyone, of any age, can follow it. Not everyone will understand everything that's going on, but we can all enjoy it. I can only comment on the original actors, as I did not choose a dubbed version; their work is marvelous, and that goes for every performance. The dialog is well-written. Apart from some potentially scary and/or disturbing content, there is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with 18 minutes(!) worth of trailers for it, and, on the second disc, the whole movie in storyboard form, with a commentary track, subtitled in English, a well-done, informative and entertaining 47 minute making-of featurette made up of behind the scenes footage, concept art, clips and narration(in Japanese, subtitled). I recommend this to anyone who can let go of the expectation of realism in their fiction. 10/10  "
41067,tt0120815,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,War,"I can't claim that Spielberg has overwhelmed me on many an occasion. I tend to find his work somewhat sentimental and too bright and up-beat for my world-view. But here, he delivers. The first thirty minutes or so of this will pretty much tell you what you need to know(and I mean that in the most positive way possible), and few will manage to avoid being pulled in, right from the start in a grip that only really lets go when the credits roll. The production quality is rather close to setting a new standard for highest. The direction is spot-on(there's some beautiful underplaying going on here), and almost all of the emotional material is done exactly right(there was perhaps one bit near the end that just∂? it is not quite there). The pacing is flawless, this never loses your interest(in spite of being close to three hours) nor moves so fast that the audience is lost. The acting is impressive(this thing's got enough acting power to fuel half a dozen of these), even Mark Vincent(even if he'd prefer we called him Vin Diesel) isn't bad(yeah, I know...I could kick myself, and no thanks, Amy). The realism is an accomplishment; the situations, the reactions, the people, everything, almost the entire way through is so close to the real thing you'd swear someone colorized actual footage or something. There is some Hollywood herein, however, but the scales are tipped so far in favour of the authenticity, it's a very, very minor complaint. Cinematography and editing are just amazing... they really bring the scenes to life, and give you a sense of what it must be like to really be there. This has got atmosphere to spare. There is a lot of violence and language. The writing is remarkable, and many details are magnificent. The story isn't the most engaging ever in an anti-war film, but it certainly is good. I recommend this to any fan of war movies, just do realize that this holds little back in its depiction. 8/10  "
41512,tt0064116,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Leone knew how to shoot and cut... he was an expert at both,"Right from the very opening moments to the last, this is perfectly crafted. You immediately realize that you are in skillful hands. This builds up tension masterfully, including in the first minute(!). The use of sound(and silence, lest we forget) is incredible, with spot-on use of the exaggerated audio produced by real objects. Morricone brings to this an astonishing score, with distinct themes(with electric guitar as well as softer instruments) and sweeping pieces, all impeccably well-composed. The editing and cinematography, with effective reveals, beautiful sets and nature, heavy use of close-ups and a sincere focus on atmosphere and mood(whilst also delivering amazing gunfights) help make this downright operatic. No, this isn't in a hurry like more recent movies, and there is not an action sequence every ten minutes... however, if you find a single frame of this ""boring"" or anything of the sort, then I would think that your attention span is simply insufficient, and I urge you to attempt to improve it and give this another chance. Other than being contrarian, I can't imagine why one wouldn't find this timeless and relevant; it's about the future(not in the science fiction way), development, love, and personal dreams... the things life itself are made of, what we all cherish most. All of this, without any instances of sentimentality, preachiness or, at 160 minutes, any wasted time. It fits so much plot(note that viewers are expected to piece some of it together) into that time without coming off as rushed and avoiding overwhelming the audience. The pacing is beyond reproach, with a gradual speed that lets all of the events unfold. Every scene is done exactly right, and they fit together with impressive precision. The sense of humor is great. Costumes are beyond reproach. Everyone in this is a perfect casting choice, right down to the least seen extra; their faces add an immeasurable amount to this, especially in the cases of the goons and the three male leads(R.I.P., truly sorry to lose you). Robards is so ridiculously charming that I could remember him from Enemy of the State(yes, for as briefly as he appears in that), Fonda plays against expectations with an absolutely chilling result, and Bronson, I believe, started doing his thing, what he's so famous for, in this very picture. Do I even need to point out that this is among the (spaghetti) Westerns(it references the classics of the genre, by the way) that constructed our idea(then and current) of what macho is? Compare it. The short lines, ""cool-ness"", their behaviour(I will put no details here). Cardinale is *stunning*, and, as goes for the others(not merely the leads), an excellent actor. She is an early strong female character(that all of them are marvelously developed begs mentioning), too. Dialog is well-written. There is plenty of violence that gets brutal and contains blood here and there, occasional sensuality and a little moderate language in this, and it is disturbing at times. The Special Collector's Edition DVD comes with a rather interesting and informational commentary track(by directors, including the ""Johns"" Carpenter and Milius, an author of a book on Sergio and a film historian), four featurettes, two stills galleries and a trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the medium. 10/10  "

When dealing with something controversial and brutal, you can water it down and appease censors, or you can match it in how relentless it is. In the case of a flawed ideology, the battle can be fought mainly by letting the followers and their actions speak for themselves(this is not propaganda; what we see in this could have happened). That is what we have here. I've read that this was based on a true story; while I don't know for sure, I can imagine that it is. The editing is sharp and vicious, not playing down what we're seeing in the least. Cinematography is dynamic and it keeps the pace(and intensity) high throughout, without reaching the point where we are overwhelmed or something didn't properly register with us. It is a 110-minute dirty, bumpy ride down a bad road, with the result that we can only seek to avoid the path, and deter others from following it, as well. The acting is spellbinding, every single performance. I found myself realizing that I knew these people from other stuff(then again, why haven't I seen Guy Torry in anything else good(steer clear of The Animal)? He's great!); however, they are so convincing here that they disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. Furlong is amazing. Norton ignites the screen as the furious and charismatic Derek. Apparently, he recut this to get himself more time... I don't know, maybe he did; I have to admit, I am rather happy with the released version. The ending is perfectly underplayed, a brilliant pay-off to a subtle setup and an undeniable fact of the problem of racism and hatred(as a sort of spot-on period to a film about those subjects). All of the script is impeccable. The dialog is natural, and the unrestrained feel of it helps paint a clearer image of the types we're following. This is funny at times, and it isn't without uplifting moments(not to be confused with sap or sentimentality); there is light at the end of the tunnel, it's merely dim. The author of this does not have anything other than this to his credit(well, S.W.A.T. was decent)... don't let that fool you. There is a ton of strong language, graphic, bloody and terrifying violence and disturbing content, a little sexuality(and a rape) and male nudity, including full frontal in this, and none of it is gratuitous. The DVD comes with three deleted scenes coming to a total of six and a half minutes and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to anyone mature enough for it, and who has the stomach for it(yes, regardless of any other parameters). 10/10  "
44220,tt0816692,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Very nearly out-of-this-world,"With Earth running out of resources, astronauts make a last-ditch attempt at locating other habitable planets within reach. This is possible via a wormhole, of unknown origin. And it *has* to work. At its core, this is about the love between a father, Coop(McConaughey, an everyday man with vital experience and a good team leader), and his daughter, Murph(Chastain, independent and as stubborn as he is). This is simultaneously its greatest strength and weakness. Everything we are excited about rides, to some extent, on us, and them, caring about both of them, and what they share. Thus, we never stop caring, and it enhances all the thrilling space adventures(almost exclusively grounded in reality, and the best theories), where the mastery of movement(or relative stillness) of the camera and the volume of the soundtrack(and sometimes deafening silence) builds tension to its breaking point, and, crucially, never beyond it. And unfortunately, this emotional grounding does eventually lead to some sappy sentimentalism. The ending will divide audiences. This owes a great, and openly acknowledged, debt to Kubrick's 2001, but it isn't a mere tribute to that, and to exploration of the stars and what that can bring, the latter of which it seeks to encourage a return to. It goes different places, and the third act will be long debated, as it deserves. The humor is well-integrated, not distracting and it eases us out of what would otherwise be relentless and unbearable heaviness. All of the effects are amazing, and the technology compelling. Watch this in the theater, it is made very much for that, as far as the visual and audible experience. The 2 hour and 45 minute running time, and that's not counting the closing credits, will scare some off, and it is perhaps too long. There is some disturbing content and a little moderate language in this. I recommend it to everyone who doesn't outright hate Nolan∂? it is very much one of his films, for better as well as worse, however, even with the hokey aspects, this is one you shouldn't miss. 8/10  "
46538,tt0054215,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Hitchcock's best film, by far","Hitchcock was a masterful director... no one can deny his talent for creating and sustaining suspense. He had a gift for making memorable and impressive films, and Psycho is without a doubt one of the most well-known and popular. One of the reasons is of course the famous shower scene, but that's only one of many memorable and well-done sequences. The reason we remember that particular scene is not only how nicely filmed, tightly edited and effective it is... but also how credible it is. We believe in it, despite how little it shows of what it depicts, we believe that it happens, despite all we see is innuendo and hinting. The plot is great. Entirely credible and realistic. The whole film is psychologically accurate. The acting is superb, particularly Anthony Perkins. The pacing is great; you're hardly ever bored. The writing is excellent, both as far as story and dialog go. There are plenty of quotable lines. What makes this film work so well is how realistic and believable it is. What makes it shocking is how surprising it is. What makes this film have such an impact is that it's perfectly credible. I won't reveal any more, in case anyone reading this review don't know the twist of the film. If you are one of those people, watch this before you're told of it. It's incredible. I recommend this to any fan of horror, thriller and/or Hitchcock. 10/10  "
48312,tt0120689,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,A true masterpiece," Just like the summary says; this movie is truly a masterpiece, a modern work of art. The movie is a modern retelling, or a modernization of the story of Jesus. While I never have been, and never will be a Cristian, something in this movie really spoke to me. It had a wonderful message, one that is hard to retell by mere words. To truly understand the wonder of this movie, you have to see it, to experience it for yourself. The plot is excellent, though I thought it moved a little slow at times, but that's mainly because the movie is nearly three hours long. Considering how long it is, it's incredible. I never lost interest in it. The acting is fantastic; especially Tom Hanks and Michael Clarke Duncan give amazing performances. Normally I hate Stephen King, but for the first time, I'm actually considering reading one of his books, out of my own free will. If I got the chance, I would probably read the book, just to find out if it tells the story any better, though that is nearly impossible. I recommend this to any fan of dramas, in fact, pretty much all movie fans. Everyone should at the very least get a chance to see this masterpiece. 10/10  "
48875,tt0047396,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"One of the greatest Hitchcock films, but not his best","While Psycho is still my favorite Hitchcock film, this comes very, very close to that. Having only seen the made-for-TV remake starring Christopher Reeves, I was quite excited to see this, as it's referred to by many as one of the(if not the) greatest Hitchcock thriller. Now, while I still prefer Psycho over this, I must say that it's a very well-done and effective mystery-thriller, and most of the second half had me almost biting my nails from suspense. The plot is very good, and its theme appeals to some of the most base instincts, including the tiny little voyeur that we all have. The pace is great, I was never bored during any point of the movie. The acting is great, Stewart and Kelly give excellent performances. The characters are all well-written, credible, and, as they almost always are under Hitchcock's direction; very human. The cinematography is excellent; most of the camera angles are from inside the main character's apartment, which creates a very effective and scary feeling of claustrophobia and adds to the suspense. The mystery keeps you guessing throughout the movie, but the ending seemed a little like a letdown... there's no definite answer to the mystery. Then again, maybe that was Hitchcock's intention... to any true mystery, there is no real answer. And Hitchcock probably wanted to have each viewer make up an answer for him- or herself. The film has some great suspense, and a few of the scenes will have you sitting at the edge of your seat. The ending was very close to being anticlimactic, but it managed to make up for it by having one of the most thrilling and nail-biting endings in a Hitchcock film ever. The main reason I rate Psycho higher than this on a personal scale is that the theme works better there... the killer is more easily understandable, while here he's just... well, sloppy and arrogant, half of the time. That was my one complaint while watching the movie, and it won't bring down my rating, not even a notch, because I'm positive it was the way Hitchcock intended it to be. His characters are always human, and what is more human than failing? I recommend this film to any fan of thriller, mystery and/or Hitchcock. You won't be disappointed. Great film. 10/10  "
49541,tt0103064,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,There's a reason this is so appreciated,"Let it be said right away: There is at least one obvious issue with this. That doesn't have to include the fact that this is one of those sequels that are so much like the original that one could argue that it's partially a remake. What I'm referring to is that going by the first, it technically shouldn't exist. I am not aware of anyone who considers the predecessor of this to be the only film in this series(I've experienced many who, with good cause, deny there to be a third movie... heck, I am one of them), but I could see why there could be. However, if you look past that(and you ought to at least consider doing so, as this doesn't come off as one of those follow-ups released to cash in on an earlier success), you're in for an undeniably enjoyable and well-done cinematic experience. The plot is interesting and well-told. The pacing is solid. The acting is great from all, Patrick is an incredible addition, and neither Arnie nor Linda have forgotten how to portray their role. The action gets bigger, and still consists of fights, shootouts and car chases, all of which are marvelous and exciting, and never degenerates into stupidity. The guns are still impeccably well-chosen and handled. Really cool. The new concept or two herein are very smart and well-thought out. The science fiction remains well-done. This holds an appropriate amount and volume of self-irony over the title character(though I did not mind the seriousness of the previous silver screen effort). While some of the dark tone is maintained, it is less violent and disturbing than the 1984 piece. There is also no nudity(well, just about) or sexuality in this. I have more points against this, meanwhile, they all give stuff away, and this will remain a spoiler-free review. And even with them, it's hard to argue with the quality of this, even if you prefer The Terminator to it(and I do). I recommend this to any fan of sci-fi, intense scenes, James Cameron, the others who made this, and/or food for thought wrapped neatly in celluloid. 10/10  "

The former goes undercover, to work for the Irish mafia. And the latter... he's an informant for selfsame mob. Duality is the main theme here, and it is explored well(it's no accident that these two leads look so alike). Both are affected by their double lives, and both try to get help by, and subsequently get to liking, cop counselor Madolyn. Nicholson does impeccable, one of his best recent roles. Wahlberg is quite impressive, which is a bit new to me. He also comes off really cool, which goes for, well, all of the main cast. Di Caprio and Damon are fantastic. Sure, the Boston accents are over the top(well, Matt's and a few others... Baldwin appears to think he's portraying a Kennedy), but that's easy enough to look past. The slang is convincing and comes off mostly natural, sprinkled across the sharp, witty and swift dialog. Characters are credible, well-defined and nicely developed(through short, effective scenes that set things up). The pace is tight, and the two hour 25 minute running time is packed. This is directed superbly, and the editing and cinematography are amazing. The tension is thick and built expertly. There is a lot of strong language, bloody, gruesome, gory violence, and a little sexuality in this. The DVD comes with five trailers, one of them for this, the others being for The Painted Veil, The Reaping, 300, Blood Diamond. I recommend this to any fan of Scorsese, crime dramas and/or the actors. 8/10  "
52347,tt0253474,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Breathtaking,"It's rare to see a film of such quality. Polanski has been directing marvelous films for decades, with effective editing and his seemingly unique cinematography. When a brilliant director goes to work on a very personal project, it is almost invariably a certainty that their heart and soul will be put into making it. When a film is made about a major historic event, in particular when countless films have been made regarding it already(and one would be quite hard pressed to find an event that has had more films made about it than World War 2), it needs to make a point or to offer something that we have yet to see. A new perspective, an idea that hasn't been explored before. Benigni gave us Life Is Beautiful(La Vita «∏ Bella), which had one such idea, a beautiful, sweetly naive one. Polanski offers another, one that is at least as heart-warming and life-affirming. He brings the history to life, and does so with such effective direction that the film holds you in an iron grip. You feel compelled to refrain from watching more, yet you cannot look away. Such pain, horror and despair is depicted without flinching, without holding back, without censoring the worst parts out. You see all the cruelty of the Nazis, the degeneration of the health, lives and dignity of the Jews, and the slow but inevitable destruction of Warsaw. All from Szpilman's point of view. That was part of what made this so strong and affecting; he was there. Every single one of these situations, countless of times that he could have been killed... he was there. And at the end of it all, when you hear this man's beautiful music being played, one can't help but think; if war, hate and the rest of the world's evils are a result of the flaws of human beings... then the fact that this man, this creative being, this artist, made it through seemingly impossible odds, and came out of so many potentially lethal situations alive, must surely be proof that in spite of aforementioned evils, in spite of how hopeless it all may seem at times... there is still hope and beauty. It may be beaten down, it may be injured, but it shall never truly perish. The plot is well-written, and develops nicely throughout. The pacing is perfect, there's not a boring or overly fast moment to be found. The effects and design are flawless, it's all extremely authentic and realistic, as are most of the scenes. The cinematography is amazing. As my father commented while we watched: ""You really feel like you are him(Wladyslaw)."" A beautiful film, that takes you through arguably the worst historic event of the latter half of the previous century. I recommend this very highly to anyone who believes that they are strong enough to sit through it. It's most definitely not pleasant. Not to be missed. 10/10  "

Whilst this is rather 80's(and granted, that has a charm of its own... it can, however, also be really off-putting), it does stand up well enough, with few jokes and gags having aged poorly. ...is one of those bullies seriously wearing 3-D glasses? The characters tend to be well-done, if there are some really obvious stereotypes(but it seems intentional). Humor works pretty well, if it can be really silly and goofy at times. The dialog is good, some really memorable lines. You always understand the ""science"" aspect, without a lot of wordy explanations, and there is no technobabble. The music is catchy. Acting is great, other than some over the top performances(again, they didn't happen by accident). It's a fun, rewatchable High School comedy flick with time-travel. The climax is also surprisingly tense, for how predictable parts of this can be. I recommend this to any fan of the decade, the cast and the concept itself. 8/10  "

The acting is marvelous, with Crowe, Phoenix and Reed(R.I.P.) bringing their roles to life. All characters are credible and well-developed. The fighting, although apparently not consistent with reality of how they were trained, is really cool; they're of varying length with nice choreography. They're covered in close-ups and with hand-held, which really gives them a sense of intensity. The scope is epic, and this is realistic and authentic, giving you a feel of how it was back then. This has well-done FX, you basically can't tell the CGI from the real. The photography is excellent, with really impressive visuals. Dialog is fine. It is a tad Hollywood, as the overall thing is. Honestly, I would rate Spartacus higher than this. Kirk has gravitas far beyond that of Russell, the battles are *unforgettable* and powerful, the interplay between the people is heartfelt and rings true(and pays off), and the story is simply more inspirational(slave rises up against his master, early human rights campaign... this is just ""I'm going to get back what I lost or get payback for it"", and could have been set any other time or place).

Incredibly enough, despite how sky-high my expectations were for this film, I was pleasantly surprised and my expectations were definitely exceeded. As you probably already know, this whole film runs 'backwards'... meaning that you start by seeing the end, and then go all the way back to the beginning. There's a line in the film that perfectly states the immediate thought that just about anyone has about this idea when they first hear it: ""I always thought the joy of reading a book is not knowing what happens next."" A reasonable assumption, but not always a true one. Especially not when it comes to this film. Because every single scene, up to (but not including) the very last one, starts with the ending of the next one, and ends with the beginning of the previous one. This makes the mystery even more elusive and adds more intensity to the thriller portions of the film. The brilliant and unique reverse time-line is perfectly explained by the main characters condition. This is the best film I've seen in quite a while, and I can't argue with its position on the top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #20). While some might think it's just a typical mystery-thriller with a non-linear time-line thrown in, but it's so much more than that. Like another reviewer points out, it's not what you say, but how you say it. Between every scene in the backwards moving time-line, there is one in black and white that follows a normal time-line. This is great as a break from the scenes moving towards something you already know, and makes the mystery even harder to figure out. The great thing about this film is, not only do we experience the same confusion that the main character does, but we also find out the truth, which he learns at the beginning of the story, at the end of the film. With it comes some nice observations and truths, which I'll let you discover for yourself. I won't jot down the plot here; read a quick summary somewhere or just watch the film and find out about it. I might ruin the surprise for you, a crime greater than most. Everyone deserves to see this film and discover all of it for themselves. I will say, though, that it's brilliant. The pacing is excellent, you're never bored and you never lose interest. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. Do yourself a favor; know as little about this film as possible. Don't ask anyone about it, don't read about it. Just rent it and watch it, you won't regret it. I recommend this film to anyone who can appreciate fine film-making, but I suppose fans of mysteries, thrillers and/or dramas might enjoy it more than people who aren't interested in those genres. I do suggest that everyone should at least consider this film. 10/10  "
57290,tt0078788,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,Hard to sit through and not terribly good ending,"The only two problems with this movie are, as the one line summary states, the length and the ending. It's so long that unless you're very determined or very patient, you're not gonna sit through it to the end(particularly not if you're watching the ""redux"" version which I was(un?)lucky enough to see on TV). And the ending seems to suggest that Coppola had either run out of steam or simply didn't know how he should end it. As a war film, it's not particularly realistic, I guess, but more of a piece about the descent into madness that you experience under such dehumanizing circumstances. I found it interesting to see as such a film, but arguably not much else... I also found it interesting to recognize the actors, whom I, for the most part, hadn't seen in a film from, at least before the 80's. If any of this doesn't make sense, don't blame me... blame the fact that I'm writing this as I'm almost falling asleep after the movie. Now, let it be known, that I didn't pay attention to the entire thing; I am neither a man of great patience nor determination(well, not enough, anyway) so I fell asleep once or twice through this film, and actually found myself awaking a few minutes after it had ended, and had to rewind it to catch the ending. Maybe that affected my judgment, maybe not(it probably did). However, what I saw, I mostly liked. The acting is very good. The characters are well-written and nuanced. The action is well-done. The cinematography is very good. All in all, a very good film, if you have the patience and you're sufficiently interested in seeing this very well done piece of film, despite it's very long runtime(maybe you would want to start with the original version, not the ""redux"" one I saw). I recommend it to just about anyone who really is interested in films and the media of movies. If you can sit through it, you probably should. Any Coppola fan should definitely experience this. 9/10  "
57906,tt0482571,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,No Hell March,"I haven't read the novel; for a brief and concise list of differences, see the FAQ(and it contains spoilers, obviously; this review doesn't). The Nolans strike again with their very favorite subject; obsession. I won't make a crack about how they can't let that go. This and its ad campaign asks you to ""watch closely"", and frankly, it's because of me doing that that I figured out nearly every major twist. I'm not bragging; I honestly wish that there had been more surprises left. No, I'm warning you to not try to figure the secrets of this out before they are revealed to you, or at least not too hard. I also do agree with Ebert's complaint that they cheated in this. With that said, this is engaging, interesting and compelling from start to finish. The plot is marvelous, and this is well-paced. This is psychologically deep and accurate. The acting is amazing. This has a non-linear time-line, and utilizes it well. The story is fairly complicated, and you do need to pay attention. Script and dialog are well-written. This has fun moments, and the tone isn't all dark. Johansson looks incredibly hot as usual, and this does have some(albeit well-integrated and natural-seeming) eye-candy for males. There is a bit of bloody violence, a little mild to moderate language and plenty of disturbing content in this. The DVD contains a handful of short, informative featurettes, four photo galleries and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the director or anyone else who helped put this together. 10/10  "
58971,tt0110357,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Another of the Disney greats,"I've just watched this with the original voices, for the first time. Why is that, you ask, when there has been a purchased VHS copy of the film in my possession since around the time it was first released? The simple fact is that here in Denmark, we dub... anything that's made for children, or is considered ""family entertainment""(which is really just a word used to mask that something is made for kids, enough so that the teenagers and possibly some of the adults won't make a run for it the moment the suggestion of viewing it is said out loud before the family members). I'm not really in favor of it, I prefer the originals(sub, don't dub... the voice is one of the tools that an actor has, the sound a major part of a film, and through that, the director's work, and the actors and crew, for that matter), but hey, at least we're not France or Germany(good luck watching *anything* on German television that isn't in German, regardless of whether they made it or not). For that reason, the voices were some of what I noticed the most, along with the original dialog and lyrics to songs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas isn't bad at all. Broderick does good, though were it not for the animated form of his character, I'm not sure he would come across as strong as he does when he needs to... seriously, who could ever be scared of him? Of course, it could be the roles he seems to play often. Marin, Goldberg and Cummings make good hyenas. Irons is great. Guillaume(try spelling *that* three times fast) is marvelous. I didn't personally care much for Atkinson, but hey, I've always preferred his Blackadder(in particular after the first season/show) to his Mr. Bean(a character I don't find funny), and this is clearly done after the latter, not the former. Fans of Bean may very well enjoy the character(much like how Robin Williams fans might enjoy at least his part in Aladdin), and he's not the only one(not only for this Disney film, either) who bears strong similarities to their character, to the point where in many cases, it would seem(and sometimes they even say so) that the animators and such based the look and mannerisms on the actual actor/performer. I saved what may very well be the best for last... James Earl Jones. What can I say? The man almost invariably(in anything he appears in) has an undeniably commanding presence, and that is arguably mainly due to his voice, so casting him was a smart choice, and it pays off. The plot is well-written. The animation is quite good, with a bright, varied, colorful palette, and lively movements both in the camera and in the players. I didn't find this as energetic or funny as Aladdin, but it was still enjoyable. The music is magnificent, Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a fantastic song, and it's not the only one in the feature(to which that adverb can be applied). The DVD has some marvelous material, including music videos, a few deleted bits, some games(one of which isn't half bad), a Virtual Safari and featurettes regarding... just about everything you could imagine, regarding the film, including the stage production based off it, the music in it, even the animals. I recommend this, and its DVD release, to fans of the Disney animated musicals, and/or of any or more of the actors. 8/10  "
59875,tt0078748,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,7,"I remain underwhelmed, I'm afraid","This film is quite popular, at least judging from it's rating(as I'm writing this, it's placed #50 on the top 250 list). I realize that this was probably a benchmark for special effects when it was made, but now the effects seem incredibly dated(which they don't, at the very least to the same extent, in pieces from the same period, best example being Star Wars), and many scenes seem clich«∏d today, even though I suppose they were fresh when it was made. I guess the main problem with the thing is that it doesn't age well, but I also think it lacks too much in both character development and humor... just a little comic relief would have made the nearly two hours go by so much easier(for me, this merely gets slower and less watchable with each repeated viewing). Attempts at making you laugh fall flat on their faces. There are far more unintentional laughs to be had, at various corny and odd things(why does this have so much weird stuff in it, and why do the people who love it just accept that?). More often than not, to me(and one person I know who *loves* these movies), this just ends up being too hard to take seriously. I'm willing to entertain the theory that Ridley Scott's stuff just isn't for me, I've yet to be amazed by him. For how much sheer, unsynthesized acting talent this has, the players have next to nothing to work with(they do turn in fine performances). Nonetheless, the film does manage to scare me and provide some shocks, even though I've seen this and the other films at least three times before. The film manages to establish a pretty nicely done, spooky atmosphere that lasts for most of the film, despite its shortcomings and the very formulaic ending. The plot isn't bad, and it takes off almost immediately, keeping you fairly interested. The characters are so-so, though there aren't any really startlingly poorly written ones. The creature effects are decent enough, and they do not fail to impress at least a little. The editing has moments that are just strange, the cinematography has reasonably little to offer. Props to whoever ensured that the realism was kept at such a high level. The sets, and in general the production design, is all well-done(some is nothing short of breathtaking). I've read one suggestion that stories set where this is and similar are more straining on the audience, and they are more likely to be bored, in spite of the potential talent possessed by those who put it together... I'm inclined to agree. There is some language, and violence as well as gore is also featured herein. I have to admit, I see this as valuable more as an introduction to the world of the title creature, and find, for example, Cameron's expansion of, and further adventure within, it considerably more worthwhile. Don't expect a masterpiece, and prepare to test your patience, especially if you've seen many of these films. The ""Director's Cut""(though he feels the original fits that bill better... hey, at least it's not as bad as the alternate name, ""Extended Version"", which is even a misnomer as it *shortens* the overall length) adds a few things, which you may find worth a look, if you like it(not that there are that many, I count five chapters with additions in the DVD's own breakdown). The commentary track is an OK enough listen, some of the stuff said is cool to hear. I recommend it to fans of alien-type science fiction, and fans of sci-fi horror films(as such, it's good enough) in general. I suggest any possible Alien-fans to-be to start with this film, rather than any of the other films. The series works best in correct order. 7/10  "
59930,tt0057012,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Still laughing, long past the end credits...","Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb, so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven't seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick's side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn't overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clich«∏s... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, and very well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick's most well-paced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I'm not too fond of Sellers, but here he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick's other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick's films, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I'll just suggest you see it. Seriously, if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you're going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did, but you'll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can't praise it enough. See it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won't regret it. I know I didn't. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10  "
60958,tt0032553,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,"Great, indeed","In Tomania(Germany), dictator Hynkel(Chaplin, doing a fantastic job aping and subverting Hitler's(both he and Mussolini are reduced to spoilt children, screaming when they don't get their way, with their world-altering war decisions being nothing more than them stroking their own egos... an all too true breakdown of many major despots) mannerisms, shouting nonsense speeches and short temper) has a doppelganger in a poor, kind Jewish barber(the contrast he creates between these is compelling) - and the fact that the two look the same, yet are treated so differently is one of numerous clever, and often subtle, comments on the ideology. The writing reveals a thorough understanding of the thinking, reasoning and actions of the Nazis. Sure, there are details that are changed or the like, forgivably to ease the story-telling, to make a point, etc. There are also other types of comedy; mocking and black humor is used to remove the sting from the fear of the shells, army and the mistreatment of the children of Israel. And that last one is treated seriously, as well. The tone will switch very effectively, and suddenly we are afraid of something similar to what we've just been chuckling at. This way, the reality doesn't become lost, and one can sense the actual threat of persecution and foreign invasion right underneath it all. The smart references, including some that, at the time, not everyone would have known enough to get, are mixed in with simpler material. While the slapstick can be rather inspired, the wordplays are on the nose(Italy becomes Bacteria... those don't even sound alike...), and there is the occasional half-baked gag, abandoned as quickly and abruptly as it is begun. This is swiftly paced, and the 120 minute running time tends to go by smoothly(if the narrative jumps awkwardly once or twice). Acting is strong for all concerned, both the broad gesturing and the finer nuances(Goddard is charming, inspiring and memorable as the outspoken Hannah). There is a little violent and disturbing content in this. I recommend this to everyone who appreciates satire dealing with tragedy. 9/10  "
61246,tt0405094,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,The watchers and the observed,"This is a spell-binding film. Absolutely captivating. Before the Berlin Wall fell, Stasi conducted surveillance on anyone they suspected of harboring thoughts and opinions against the Communist rule of Eastern Germany. We follow a man employed by the DDR to listen in on a specific household, and how he gradually becomes emotionally attached to these two people that he, unbeknownst to them, is recording the actions of. This gives a psychological and realistic look at not only the people who are the subject of a constant invasion of privacy, but also those who are responsible for it. There is tremendous authenticity, in this. It is dramatic, engaging, suspenseful, and, frankly, beautiful. The plot is excellent, and develops rather well. This has spot-on pacing, and it's never boring. The acting is beyond reproach, every single performance in this is stunning. All of the music and score fits. The writing is incredible, the credibility, the characters, the dialog, the scenes... I could go on. Since I only followed what was said from the subtitles, I cannot comment on whether or not there is harsh language in this. There is sexuality and nudity, and I would say that a certain maturity level is necessary to appreciate this anyway. The DVD holds a trailer, some previews for other movies, a showcase of the actual equipment used and several interviews, all of them worth the time. I recommend this to anyone who has a chance to see it. 10/10  "
62851,tt1853728,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Money for flesh,"Set two years before the Civil War, when the German Dr. Schultz(Waltz, kind(yet determined), showing that he can do that just as well as that) frees the slave Django(Foxx, hardened(with a heart), you're not going to agree with everything he does), he asks his help in exchange for being his mentor, training him in his own field: bounty hunting. And along the way, he agrees to help free his wife... but that will not be easy, because she is being held by the flamboyant Calvin Candie(DiCaprio, playing it as an insidious psycho, shining in his first villain role, and shattering his fluffy, romantic image utterly; at one point, he caressed a horse, and it literally sent a chill down my spine... that is how despicable he is), and his ""spy"", Stephen(Jackson, as a manipulative traitor to his ethnicity), and they are not to be taken lightly. This is tense throughout, with us constantly worrying that our titular anti-hero(who is soft-spoken, both fulfilling the spaghetti Western trope and convincing you that he's been kept down his entire life) will suddenly just draw his gun and unload on the awful people abusing his kind - we know that they outnumber him, and that is not the way to successfully accomplish it. The action is incredibly tightly packed when it is there(keep in mind that this is a drama-thriller), and the rest of the time, we're either expecting it to erupt any minute, or catching our breath. Humor is impeccable, and I spent more than most of the 2 hour, 44 minutes(not counting end credits; ever self-indulgent, and could have been cut down to less? Sure. And the pacing does suffer a little, all entirely forgivable if you're into the director) of the running time doing one of three things: tapping my foot to the music(including both Ennio Morricone *and* modern rap music... and yes, somehow, it's always perfectly fitting; the mix of very different cultural elements is complementary), laughing uproariously, or with my heart pounding. It's shot beautifully on film, capturing every detail of the carefully designed props, costumes, sets, and the gorgeous exteriors, including snowy mountains. Tarantino(who packs minor roles with cameos from people we've seen in other of his pictures, and everyone cast looks the part, with unknowns missing teeth or speaking in a strange accent(the Southern is strong in this one) imbues this with his usual wordy, quotable dialog, though not much chronological jumping or complex plotting. There is pervasive graphic violence(brutal and bloody, highly unpleasant and disturbing to watch... not only because of the subject matter, although that does make it appropriate... well played, Quentin) and language(not big on the N-word? It's every fourth of fifth word spoken, here), and brief nudity(full frontal male, and topless female) in this. I recommend this to any big fan of his(if you only ""like"" his films, wait for a rental... and those who don't already enjoy his work need not apply at all). 10/10  "
63469,tt0081505,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"Fails a little for a horror flick, but still a pretty good job by Kubrick","I've heard many claim this to be a failure, either due to it straying too far from the book(something that apparently ticked King off, though he wasn't the first writer to be less than satisfied with Kubrick's adaptation of their work) or due to Kubrick's love for setting a mood and building atmosphere ruining the scares, at least if you're into sudden shocks, gore and stuff like that. Personally, I don't care too much about the source material... of course, that's probably due to my distinct dislike of Stephen King. But a good story is a good story, no matter who or where it came from. And the better part of the good story here may have come from Kubrick, and it may have come from King. I don't really care. I will admit that the film does fail in some areas, though, as a horror film. The scares are not as constant as they feel they should be, and the film only really works on the atmospheric level. The atmosphere and mood is great. No doubt about that. The film has a nice mysterious feel to it, nothing is explained in too much detail. The story is pretty good, as well as thoroughly interesting and involving. I saw this film once before, years ago... and even though I didn't understand too much of it, I liked it a lot. Particularly because of the story and the atmosphere. The plot is very good, interesting and involving. The pacing is quite good, there are only a few scenes where you're somewhat bored. I believe this is mainly because Kubrick wasn't too used to horror movies... or maybe his approach to the genre just wasn't the best. Through his career, Kubrick went through just about every single movie genre, often only making a single movie in each genre. That might be the reason some of his movies(this one and Full Metal Jacket, mainly) aren't as good as his better movies(A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Dr. Strangelove). The acting is good, though it can be argued that the two leads, Nicholson and Duvall, overplay and underplay, respectively, at times. The characters are well-written and credible, though it can be argued that some of them are a little thin. The special effects are great, and still hold up today. All in all, a pretty good horror film, and a very good Kubrick film, but definitely not for all tastes. I recommend it to fans of Kubrick, atmospheric horror films, atmospheric films in general, and possibly fans of the actors involved. 8/10  "

Their father is off fighting, and they have to go to live with their aunt, who scolds them at an increasing rate and level. After a while, they move out, into a shelter. This follows their struggle to survive, on dwindling food supplies and sudden plane raids. In the way of a classic tragedy, this hints at its inevitable conclusion from the very beginning. This doesn't make it ""predictable"", as the point is not to surprise; it renders it even more powerful, as we find ourselves losing the battle in trying to deceive ourselves of where it is headed. I have not read the novel and can draw no comparisons. Like the other Studio Ghibli pictures, this feels very true to life and natural. The astonishing attention to detail, the immense realism, the tiny little human aspects, these have you forgetting that you're not watching live-action(the mood is spot-on, and you're transported directly into the situation). And the animation is impeccable. This is deeply moving and engaging(and it is more focused on this than the plot). If it does not tug at your heartstrings, you are officially a robot. At the same time, it isn't manipulative, and your sympathy and empathy are awoken in an honest manner. The sound design is excellent(and it uses the absence thereof, silence, to fantastic effect), backing up the visuals in recreating something very close to the real world. While there is stylization, and not everything in this is what it appears, it doesn't betray this objective of credibility. This builds and maintains atmosphere extremely well. Whether it's the siblings having trouble getting by, them playing together, an explosive assault from above, it comes across as genuine. The pacing is perfect. At about 90 minutes, this is not in a rush, and it lets you absorb the individual parts of what's going on. The acting is phenomenal. I base this on the original version, not a dubbed one. There is a bit of highly disturbing, bloody, violent, gory and brutal content in this. The DVD comes with a feature-length track of alternate angle storyboards(and another 10 and a half minutes of extra ones), two interesting interviews(one with the writer/director that comes in at 17 and a half minutes, the other with film critic Roger Ebert, that has a running time of 12 minutes), an informational 12 and a half minute documentary (""Historical Perspective""), a 6 and a half minute Japanese release promo, a 4 and a half minute DVNR featurette, a 3 minute art gallery, one US trailer and one Japanese(both 2 minutes).

Legislation has made organized crime a thing of the past in the city, and with no need for the caped crusader, Bruce(once again impeccably acted by Bale... and yes, the voice has thankfully been toned down) has a gap in his life that he doesn't know how to fill(straining the relationship between him and Alfred, played by the usually charming and compelling Caine). When a mysterious masked man, known as Bane, a dominating physical presence with a brain(played largely by Hardy's eyes and brows... taking a ton of his tools as an actor away, and still he does incredible), with unclear motives makes his presence known, he realizes he will have to become Batman again. But is he enough to take out this new threat? This finishes the series, providing closure to the characters and story. Catwoman is done right here, and just about perfect. She's finally a femme fatale... hot and manipulative. They do with her what we hoped they'd do with Black Widow. And this does justice to the relationship between her and Wayne. The performances are great all around. Most return from the other two(and Freeman gets a lot more to do), with a few new faces, such as Gordon-Levitt as idealistic cop John. This does a lot to surprise us, and like TDk, it does it right, with hardly any of them being unnecessary, and none of them insulting. The bleakness is back and amplified - this puts its titular hero and its audience through a serious amount of pain and conflict, with a genuine feeling that it might not work out. And as a result of this, and other brave decisions made(you can barely believe these are mainstream movies!), it becomes really powerful, really draws us in. The action is the biggest and best of these(the jet he uses is awesome! And the Pod gets some more really cool use, in the edge-of-your-seat chases, and we get fast martial arts(and covered well!), and the stakes and tension are the highest(and frankly, if they were raised any higher, it would be excessive... this is already as draining as the last one). There is a lot of disturbing content, some violence and a little moderate to strong language in this.

When he first sees his daughter's female friend, he falls for her. Finding himself reinvigorated, he starts to go for all the things that he has denied himself. We can't stop cheering for him, because he's clearly a good guy that has been oppressed. He, and every other character in this, is brilliantly written, with several layers to them. Everyone cast is the exact right choice, and the acting is completely beyond reproach. I did not realize that Bentley was so talented, or Bening. However, I did already know that Birch, Suvari, Cooper and the impeccable Spacey had immense skill, and they certainly show it here. The dialog is excellent and the delivery is spot-on. This is well-written and well thought out. The script is marvelous. This is also hilarious, no attempt at humor falls flat, and it never tries too hard. There is something in this for anyone who is at least a teenager. This has frequent strong language, some violence and brief nudity. I recommend this to those who are mature enough for it. 10/10  "

For the protection of his kin and in order to revert this process, he leaves on a journey. He finds a young woman running a lead mill crafting rifles, with ambitions of rule and no care for the damage she does to nature(and he is suffering some of the consequences). And thus we get the not-so-subtle message(hint: she represents mankind). ""Can't we all just get along"" is the idea, but it does actually take the problem more seriously(with a mature sensibility) than other of these, such as Dances With Wolves, Pocahontas, and most recently, Avatar. This also gets into the theme of anger and hate being self-destructive, not only harmful to one's surroundings. There are a lot of concepts in this, and fully comprehending and following it may require several viewings, time devoted to piecing it all together, and prior knowledge and understanding of Japanese culture. This is not for children, or even teens, but adults, setting it apart from every other Miyazaki production I've seen, which is nearly all of them. The acting is very good, and I urge you to watch this with subtitles, not dubbed. I do wonder why they did not sync up the animals, unlike the humans. The animation is excellent, with memorable designs, and mood expertly built by, among other things, the right amount(and tone, nuance) of light and dark(it also knows when and how to use sound, as well as silence). There is a bit of action, and it's intense, visually appealing and well-choreographed. Sans credits, this is 124 minutes long. The DVD comes with trailers for Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service, My Neighbour Totoro, Porco Rosso, Ponyo, this and Howl's Moving Castle, 2 Promos(coming to a running time of 8 minutes), 3 teasers(2 minutes put together) and 6 TV spots(totaling at 2 minutes). There is a lot of disturbing content, and, what seems somewhat gratuitous, a little violence, blood, gore and hints of sexuality. I recommend this to fans of Anime and those who want films that deal with the environment. 8/10  "
70151,tt0090605,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"In my opinion, by far the best of the series","One of the problems of these is that each director, albeit to varying degrees, were selfish... not only adding their respective styles and touches to their separate efforts, each also tried to make theirs the definite piece(and little was left for the next director to work with). I won't claim that Cameron wasn't, as well... nor for a second deny that he by far had the best starting place(you'll know what I mean if you've watched the first, and perhaps also this... and if you haven't, you shouldn't find out from any other source)... but darn it if he doesn't live up to it and deliver the goods(not everyone manages to, no matter how solid the hand they're dealt is). Where the first has adequate atmosphere, this has it in spades. It had maybe three or four jump scares, this is continually exciting(this actually affected me far more often, and typically more lasting). This also has humor. It looks magnificent, technically and visually speaking. I'm afraid I just cannot claim that I see how Alien measures up to this. Effects are superior(how much better could they really have gotten in seven years? Besides, if you can't get something to look convincing on the screen, why are you putting it up there?). Characters are interesting and strong. The action is awesome, some of the best for the genres(I'm not kiddin'). Direction is effective all the way, and James just gets something much more satisfying, entertaining and engaging out of the title creature. This takes the next logical step in the franchise, and does so almost flawlessly. The plot is marvelous. Pacing is excellent, this is never boring(neither version). Acting is about spot-on(and frankly much more involving and involved than that of its predecessor, with Weaver, Henriksen(nailing his performance unbelievably well), Biehn(by far one of my favorite male actors, and when James Cameron directs him, it gets kicked up a notch of considerable size) and Henn(9 years old, and so talented) being just the top picks in a film which seems devoid of poor performances. Paxton provides perfect comic relief, without being goofy or lame. The sci-fi aspects of the film are also amazing(not to ignore what Alien did have, which should also be noted), and everything about the Marines is great, cool and obviously very thought through. The Special Edition holds about 17 minutes more material, and it's invariably worth the extra time. That cut also has a commentary track, and it is rather good... Bill and Michael are so fun to listen to, and their camaraderie comes off so genuine(though they do also all partake in the, one would presume, mandatory love-fest), Gale, Stan Winston and James have quite a bit to say... even Carrie, if she doesn't throw her two cents in as much, is a pleasant inclusion. All in all, the best of the series, and definitely the most intense(and perhaps scary) of them. I recommend it to fans of Cameron and/or of the Alien series. 8/10  "
71738,tt0087843,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,Excellent gangster film from a great film-maker," Sergio Leone is truly a magnificent director; I hadn't realized the magnitude of his talent and abilities until I saw this great film. The film deals with a group of friends, who meet each other and start a partnership as children. They start out as criminals, and end up as criminals. The story is excellent, and the way it is told is great, and almost unique. The non-linear time-line in the film has been copied since this film was made, by other, mostly lesser talented, film-makers, such as Quentin Tarantino. I liked the way the first 30 minutes moved along, between present and immediate past, and then went all the way back to the very beginning of the story. The plot is excellent. The way it unfolds is truly spectacular, and while some might say that it is cheapened by the fact that we know pretty much how it'll end from the beginning, I really think it added to the greatness of the film and story. The plot also moves along at a great pace, it's never boring, despite the fact that the film is over three hours long, and it's not really an action film. I would say that it has it's share of action and suspense, though. There were sequences that rival action films that are considered as some of the best in newer times. There was at least three sequences were the suspense was nerve-wrecking, and the tension so thick you could cut it with a knife. The special effects were amazingly well-done, much better than most of the same time period. I'd have to say that effects-wise, it's probably the best movie of the 80's. The acting is spectacular. Even the child actors were amazing; it was interesting to see Jennifer Connely, who's since become a star herself, play a role at such a young age, and playing it so well. The performances of the child actors are some of the best that I've ever seen in any movie, children or adults. All of the main characters, as well as most of the supporting characters were well-acted. The characters are well-written, credible, and rarely ever seemed out-of-character. The way gangster methods is portrayed is realistic and authentic, as is some of the plot. I would have to say that this film actually almost rivals The Godfather Part I as the best gangster film ever made. The only thing that bothered me was the plot twist at the end; it really seemed wrong and unlikely to me, as well as my father, who's reading a lot about the mafia. We both agreed that it seemed weird and out of character. That one thing marred the ending for me, and brought this film down from a perfect score. Apart from the ending, the final plot twist, this film is great. I recommend this to fans of Sergio Leone, gangster films, and just great films in general. Fans of any of the actors might also find it interesting. Don't be thrown off by the long runtime; it's worth every minute, up to the end(the last 15 minutes bothered me, but nothing else). 9/10  "
71795,tt0033467,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"A great piece of cinema, a magnificent example of storytelling","I've heard so much told about Citizen Kane and Orson Welles, so I finally decided to get the film, and find out if it really is all that it's cracked up to be... I must say, it's great. The plot is great, and the way it's told is amazing. The story is first summed up in a matter of minutes, about 15, to be more accurate, and then the rest of the film has characters telling the story through flashbacks and retelling. We hear just about every opinion about Charles Foster Kane, apart from his own. The story is told after his death, and we see everything important that leads up to it, and only in the very end do we understand him, only then do we fully understand who he was, and what made him so. The ending also reveals one of the very most important things in any man or woman... one thing that everyone needs and knows of. I won't reveal it here, as it would almost be a crime to spoil the experience of this film to anyone. The acting is excellent; Welles himself is stellar as Kane, and his impressive appearance, along with his commanding voice, makes the character a forceful sight, nay, experience. The characters are well-written and credible. The character of Kane is probably the most well-rounded and perfectly built up I've seen in a movie, ever. The cinematography is excellent... the editing is great. I can't praise the angles, pans, zooms and transitions enough... it just has to be experienced. Now, for the one thing I can criticize in the film; the pacing. It's only two hours long, but it feels like much, much more. There were portions of the film where it felt like it didn't move at all. When there weren't great dialog or something equally as good in the film, it dragged terribly. There were too many scenes where the dialog seemed pointless, as well, I think. It didn't seem to be leading to anything. However, this criticism is so minor, due to the ending more than making up for it, that I still give this film a perfect score. I can't do anything but agree with its placing at the top of the top #250 films of all time, here on IMDb. As I'm writing this, it's #11. That's pretty much what it deserves, in my opinion. Not higher, not lower. Not the greatest film of all time(that pretty much still belongs to The Godfather, I think... at least, I haven't seen a better film than that, yet), but definitely far up there. I recommend this to any fan of film in general, and anyone who thinks they can understand it; it has a truly profound point that any man(and woman) should know of(preferably through seeing the film for themselves). Don't let the fact that it's old and black & white deter you from seeing this masterpiece. A true cinematic masterpiece, in every sense of the word. 10/10  "
72723,tt0082096,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Immersive and unforgettable masterpiece,"I haven't read the novel, so I base this upon the Director's Cut, which is the only release I have watched. Yes, it's three hours and fifteen minutes long. And let me tell you, it is completely worth it. The development of character and build-up of atmosphere and mood are among the best ever seen in this medium. You care about the entire crew, and they have varied personalities and every last one of them is credible. Including a reporter lets them occasionally explain something the audience needs to understand without it standing out, and apart from that, he is also someone you feel for. There are no good or bad guys in this, there are only *people*. Human beings. And you experience the terror that actual submarine crews did, as well as the filth and the claustrophobia. All without any of it getting excessive. This is intense and extremely well-paced. It manages to not overwhelm the audience to the point of over-stimulation. You don't merely witness how little room they have to move around, how two men cannot pass each other at certain parts lest they both squeeze up against the wall and move sideways, you *experience* it. If you are not OK with closed spaces, you may not want to take your chances with a viewing of this. It's exceptionally well-shot, from start to finish. The authenticity is astonishing. I understand that this really happened, and is a combination of two true stories. Exposition is delivered smoothly, and this is well-told all the way. There is occasional humor, to lighten the tension slightly. I don't want to risk giving too much plot away, so this is all I will reveal: This follows a group of young men, inexperienced rookies, on their first mission on a sub, under a veteran captain. This is well-made all the way, and it was the perfect decision to do it almost completely in sequence. The sound design is amazing, in a class of its own. Every acting performance is flawless, and it's no wonder that Prochnow got several American roles after this came out. The DVD offers a dub in English(by the same cast, I understand), though I chose to hear the original German. It also contains a trailer, a six minute featurette of sorts, about the DC edition, and a subtitled, highly informational and also fun commentary track with Wolfgang, J«¨rgen and Ortwin Freyermuth who produced this version of the film. This has relatively infrequent strong language and is disturbing, sometimes violent and bloody, and most definitely not for the faint of heart. I recommend this to anyone who likes anti-war movies. Unquestionably Petersen's greatest achievement. 10/10  "
73859,tt0052357,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Where are you now, Madeleine?","This was one of the first films I watched that made an impression on me. I doubt that I was even a teenager when, one evening, this was on TV. It had me compelled throughout, and the conclusion, well, perfection itself. Needless to say, I did not sleep well that night. I'm now 23, and I finally got a copy of it. As Leonard Maltin put it, this demands multiple viewings; there is too much to take in all at once. This is a psychological thriller about love and obsession. Hitchcock delivers a layered and personal picture(and what may be his best, this or Psycho), and not only do we find ourselves wondering and following this intently, we become as ensnared as Scottie and Alfred. We can neither entirely distance ourselves from it nor condone it. Novak truly is *stunning*, and her performance is very good. Yes, there is an age difference, but they are great together. It is an unusual role for Stewart; this increases the effect, and he is rather convincing. There is suspense(he definitely was the master) and tension right from the opening credits(!). The lighting and sets are amazing, and there are several unforgettable visuals, if the editing and cinematography of this isn't overall as memorable as others by the same director. Dialog is clever, well-delivered and funny when it means to be. The score is powerful, with a little supernatural touch to it, for self-explanatory reasons. Pace is gradual. The plot is well-written, if it doesn't hold up to close scrutiny; this is about the select few characters. There is a bit of disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with an informational commentary track(that goes back and forth, it is ""assembled"" from different people talking about it. Among them is a producer from back then and two people who restored the movie, and they talk about every aspect of it), a featurette that I will review on its own individual page here on the site and two trailers, totalling at 3 and a half minutes, that spoil some of this. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine liking it... and please treat yourself to more than one exposure to it. 10/10  "
74422,tt0086190,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,6,"He did return, but he left behind all the wonder and entertainment, in short, almost all that was good in the others","I'm not sure where it went wrong. Maybe Lucas just did not feel right about the middle one being dark, so he made this all warm and fuzzy. I didn't care for it, myself. Going by that this is about ten times further down the #250 list than the first two, I'm probably not alone in finding this a letdown. Of course, if the tone was all it was, this could still be great... but, alas, in neither case is that true. Marquand presumably also deserves portions of the blame. I don't know if he just can't do action, I haven't seen anything else by him. This just never actually engages, it certainly didn't, me. The light-saber stuff somehow never goes beyond ""dull"" and ""flat"". I know that it should, but it doesn't. The universe... honestly isn't that heavily expanded in this. A handful of new creatures, several of which are at least one of the following... irritating, more or less poorly realized visually and too cute. Designs aren't that imaginative, for a few. Places and ideas are revisited and redone. The sound comes off as not very unique. The score is still magnificent. Situations tend to be silly, their solutions, as well as how they come about. There are points of this where it seems like George forgot he wasn't writing a script for Indiana Jones. The effects don't particularly get better from the preceding entries(though, admittedly, some do). The pacing is reasonable, the film runs fairly smoothly. This doesn't have memorable or quotable lines. There is little of interest in the characters and their development is basically all in episodes IV and V. The DVD has a commentary track and it's worth a listen. I recommend this only to those who really must watch all of the Original Trilogy. 6/10  "
74520,tt0022100,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,This film is a masterpiece... and I don't use that term lightly,"My father has often told me about this movie. It's been available for next to nothing at the local DVD/CD shop here for longer than I can remember, and not long ago, I finally pulled myself together and bought it. Today, we sat down to watch it. I must say, this movie astounded and impressed me. From the first frame, it had me. It gripped me and didn't let go until the ending... if even then. If I'm not still in its clutches. The plot is excellent, and the way it's told is very interesting. It develops constantly, though never too quickly; the film never stands still, yet never moves too fast, either. The pacing is among the best in any of the films I've watched... and that list count nears one thousand titles(as I'm writing this, I'm nearing my way to 700 written reviews... but I've got a good 17 years of watching movies prior to my starting to comment on them). The acting is incredible. I can't think of a single performance I found anything less than flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The cinematography is nothing short of amazing. The way they created all those great shots, be it stationary or those with movement, at that time, with that equipment... magnificent work. Fritz (either Lang or the cinematographer, they share a first name) knows his way around cameras, and knows when to use movement... and, perhaps more importantly, when not to. This film has its share of both kinds of shots, and both work perfectly. The film uses the art of hinting to the fullest; something Hitchcock, the very master of suspense, would later employ, in huge thrillers such as Psycho. Shadows, suggestive camera movements, a tiny movement in body or face... things that, in a film of today, would be simply not be found. The silent and unclear would replaced by loud and obvious. One of the most important things to note about this film is how little it says outright... and how much it merely... hints. A careful, subtle remark, presented casually... in place of an absolute. Having recently watched Scarface, a film from the same period(it was released about a year later) which leaves little to be pondered over by the viewer(and much to be desired in that very area), the contrast between an open movie and a closed one is blatantly obvious. There is much to debate over and consider in this film. It reminded me of Alejandro Amen«≠bar - a man whom I very much admire - the Spanish director who also employs few definite truths in his films. It's not up to the director to decide what is right... but rather us, the viewers, the movie-going audience. Alejandro knows that. So did Fritz. I will have to watch more films of his. Another thing is the level of detail in this film... reminiscent of Kubrick, another master of the art of film-making, this film is packed with detail. So many seemingly meaningless, but endlessly insightful little things. A scene that shows shady types idle... a subtle touch that would be edited out as early as during the script-writing phase of most newer movies... characters that are seen once and then never again... the examples are endless. Fortunately, this review isn't that, and on that note, I'll refrain from further listing of them. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. If you can, get a original version of this film... not a dubbed one. No matter how awful you are at the language, it just fits better in German. Just make sure you've got good subtitles... I myself am rather hopelessly poor at the language, and I noticed that many times, the lazy Danish translator skipped entire sentences(though I noticed it to be prominently used words and sentences, that, when uttered and translated once, were from then on left to only be heard, and not seen, which I guess is at least more acceptable than the worse alternatives). This film is full of suspense, and some of the best I've ever seen. Again, I would guess that Mr. Hitchcock took a lesson or two from Lang and this film. I was on the edge of my seat for just about all of this, and I couldn't have taken my eyes off it had the house been on fire. Well, I might've gotten up, once my chair was caught in the flames. Last but not least... the film-noir qualities. The interplay of light and dark, the dreary atmosphere and the tone... all spot-on. The film deals with several very difficult subjects... not to be mentioned here. I suggest you watch it for yourself and make up your own mind about each of them. Lang won't force his opinion on you. For such an old film, this is really not terribly dated... apart from some things that have obviously changed over the 75 years, three generations, yes, three quarters of a century that has passed, but they're really not that obvious. Had this film been made today, little would have to be changed. Sadly, it would not get made today... for many reasons. Unless it was on the indie scene, this simply would not be made. I can't see any studio accepting it as profitable. By today's standards, it's event-less, tame and, well, black and white. Of course, that says quite a lot more about today's standards(which, in my humble opinion, are far, far lower, and, indeed, too low) than the quality of this film, which is impeccable. I recommend this to any fan of Lorre, Lang and noir. Heck, crime, thriller and suspense fans will enjoy it as well. As would most anyone, really, who aren't too used to the films of today to enjoy an old great work. 10/10  "
74688,tt0105236,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,A stylish and excellent example of expert story-telling.,"After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino, ""what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway"" view(which, as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it, there's very little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is; you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course, of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a ""regular"" film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 8/10  "
76688,tt0211915,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"Charming... but I don't think I ""got"" it","After hearing so many wildly positive comments on this film, I decided to watch it... and when I found it on the bargain rack(we aren't quite as clever with sales rhymes here in Denmark), I bought it. While the film captured me immediately with its unique style and the interesting, amusing story-telling, I found myself lost in the plot and the various actions of the characters. This was more noticeable in the latter half. Maybe it's a cultural difference, I don't know(it may also be because this isn't meant to be understood or analyzed... something I have a tendency to subject all things in life to). The main reason I watched this(positive feedback sounds good, but I've never been one to follow popular opinion) is that I'm interested in the work of the director... Jean-Pierre Jeunet. So far, I've only seen Alien: Resurrection, but I've heard fabulous things about Delicatessen from a man whose opinion I hold a great deal of trust and respect for, in particular when it comes to movies. Jeunet has a peculiar style and an unusual(occasionally bordering on the downright bizarre)sense of humor. The film clearly doesn't take place in our world... the line between the real and that which is fantasy is blurred to the point in which it doesn't exist. Normally, I'm not interested in fairy tales(and that may very well be the reason why I didn't get this film), but I found this quite charming. Everything is pretty and has a magical reason behind it. The comedy in the film is also extraordinary... it's so human, so light and delightful. Nothing crude, never offensive(except for, I suppose, to puritans) and somehow sweet. Like the naive little girl the film revolves around. I didn't quite agree with all the actions Ms. Poulain took in effort to uphold justice, but I am known to have(or attempt to have) a soft spot for most anyone, no matter their actions. As I hinted at before, the film is more... shall we say ""free"" than, for example, American films. The limits for what can be shown are looser, for better or for worse. Personally, I wasn't bothered by it, but if you think you might be, you may wish to skip this one. Most everyone who can watch this should, however... it is a welcome trip back to one's childhood, with the imaginative visuals and soft, light tone. Now, to anyone who doesn't speak French(including yours truly), you must view this with subtitles(I haven't heard of a dubbed version, and I personally find the idea of dubbing any movie appalling, unless it is a children's film and to be viewed only by children or people who haven't been blessed with the schooling necessary to be able to read; you should show the filmmakers the respect of viewing their work as they intended it). Personally, being Danish(I read once that we in this country have had just about everything subbed since some time in the early decades of the previous century), I'm not only entirely used to it, I have no problem with it(though with films like this and Der Untergang(and of course the works of Alejandro Amen«≠bar), one is reminded to read them, as I cannot understand much of anything spoken; quite different than the case is with all works in the English language, where I only read on occasion, and often simply to pick out mistakes made by the Danish-born(and often linguistically incompetent) translators). People from other countries may experience difficulty at getting used to it, however. The cinematography is stunning beyond words. Acting, editing, score... basically everything seemed flawless to me. Apart from not understanding much of what goes on for the last part of the film, I enjoyed this. I recommend it to anyone who can watch a fun, light film with a great imagination. And if nudity or sexual content bothers you, you may want to ask someone who knows you and the film to either detail it or to estimate whether or not you can handle it. 8/10  "

This has gotten very mixed reactions... is it almost criminally engaging and effective, or is it MTV-type manipulative drivel? I have to admit, I can't ignore the craftsmanship of this movie, so if you must place me in a booth, I'd be in the former of those two. The stylization is incredible and fitting. Editing and cinematography are accused of being gimmicky, with jump-cuts and this utilizing quite a few different angles and the Snorricam, but I disagree... they're part of Aronofsky's cinematic language. Whether he is a genius or a madman is open to debate. This is not easy to watch. It is rather cruel to the audience, and entirely uncompromising. It deals with addiction, in general, not only to drugs. The writing is impeccable, script, plot and dialog alike. All the characters are credible. The acting is amazing, yes, including Marlon Wayans, and Burstyn is, simply put, excellent, and utterly devastating in her performance. This has masterful music, the score is perfect and beautifully done. The one complaint that I particularly have is that, for three of the four leads, there is little to no explanation in this for how they came to use narcotics. I can imagine many viewers being deeply emotionally affected by this. The language is strong as it gets, and plentiful. While there is not a lot of violence in this, it's filled with disturbing content. There is also graphic sexuality. This is not something to watch if you aren't already relatively hardened. The DVD comes with trailers and TV spots, two of each, deleted scenes with the option of hearing Darren's thoughts on them, during them, a couple of featurettes, and lastly, a commentary track with the director, and one with Matthew Libatique.

I decided to see it after hearing pretty much nothing but praise for the film(in fact, the only negative comments I've ever heard about it is that it deviates too much from the original novel... which is something Kubrick was famous for) and because I immensely enjoyed The Shining and Kubrick's directorial style as seen in it. I must say, it's been quite a while since I saw something so full, spectacular, exhausting and powerful. From the very first frame to the very last... amazing. Kubrick's style is magnificent, his storytelling is among the best ever seen in cinema. With this film he truly captures the raw and pure qualities of violence. I don't think(well, I certainly don't hope) that anyone who ever has or ever will see this film confuses this as an ode or a tribute to violence... this is not, in any way, shape, or form glorifying violence or violent behavior. Quite the contrary, you might say. The film proves, once and for all, that violence spawns violence. Visually, the film is absolutely stunning. The angles, pans, tracking shots... fantastic work. The ideas presented in the film are more than enough to disturb and freak out any normal person... which is(at least part of) the point. If I mention the words 'eyes opened forcefully' you probably already know what I'm talking about, right? That famous sequence has been referenced, spoofed and talked about more times than just about any other visual impression in the history of cinema. The way everyone and everything turns at Alex after he's apparently cured... truly disturbing. I found a surprise at every change in scenery or even in immediate situation, especially in the latter part of the movie. The way society turns against Alex after he rejoins it, apparently a better man... one of the most 'true' and real cinematic truths ever told of humanity. We are beasts, we are what is commonly referred to as 'inhumane'... and Kubrick tells us this in a truly astonishing manner. The plot is very good. It deals with the main character of Alex, beautifully played by Malcolm McDowell, who loves 'a bit of the old ultra-violence'. He is incarcerated and offered a chance to be re-entered to society, after being 'cured' of his psychotic tendencies. The pacing is... well, hard to describe, really... it feels slow, the movie seems to move slowly... but it hardly drags at all. It's exhausting, not to mention hard to sit through, both due to the extreme content and the slowly moving plot, but it's all worth it. The point is pure genius. Pure Kubrick. The acting is flawless... and believe me, that is not a term I use lightly. Every single actor performs perfectly. The characters are perfectly written, credible in every scene and interesting. The cinematography is pure beauty... pure excellence. I've come to love Kubrick's visual style. His cuts of varying speed and intensity, his long takes when dealing with dialog... truly amazing. His use of music is astounding... the use of classical music is great and really adds to the ironic tone and the atmosphere, the mood of the film. This is truly a work of art, and an exhausting but truly worthwhile film. I haven't seen anything quite like it for a while... in fact, maybe I never have. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick or intelligent theater. If you believe yourself to be perceptive and intelligent enough to understand the film on most or all of its levels(I don't claim to, not at all), or even on the most basic levels, such as theme and morale(which is what I understood of it) then you should, nay, then you *need* to see this film. Be prepared, though, it does contain quite a lot of disturbing themes and ideas, and is not in any way for the faint of heart. 10/10  "
79537,tt0075314,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Are you talking to me?," This movie is Scorsese's masterpiece; it is a realistic portrayal of one mans reaction to seeing the very extreme nightlife of New York: pushers, psychos, whores, the list goes on. After seeing the movie 4-5 times, I still have to admit, there are some scenes which I don't fully understand, but I can still somewhat appreciate them. Robert DeNiro's acting is superb, as is Cybill Shepherds, and Jodie Fosters. All of them play their respective character convincingly. All of the minor characters are also interesting; most of them are either a psycho, racist or just plain despicable, in some way or another. The transformation that DeNiro's character undertakes, from being a nice, gentle guy, to being a gun-toting self-help psycho, is amazing. It's got some slow scenes, but overall, I recommend this to anyone who likes a psychological drama, or any hardcore DeNiro fan. 8/10.  "
80208,tt0036775,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Sort of accidentally, on purpose","I have not read the book or anything concerning the original case, and this is the only version that I've watched. If the novel is this spellbinding, I may have to get a copy. I suppose I should address something before I get into the review itself; yes, the story is quite similar to The Postman Always Rings Twice(and while this is superior, I would definitely suggest giving that one a whirl, too... the original, that is). It's the same author, and they aren't identical. They are also both somewhat reminiscent of Macbeth. Other than that I did not find myself falling in love with these leads(as I did in the Garfield/Turner one), I really cannot complain about this film(and I won't even attempt to argue against the immense chemistry that this duo has; they light the screen on fire). I have not seen a lot of Wilder's work, but I thoroughly enjoyed Some Like It Hot, as well. This is a classic piece of noir, and ought to get a viewing by every fan of such. The brilliant dialog and narration is full of metaphors, plays on words(and the like) and every line is carefully phrased, with several utterly unforgettable exchanges. Editing and cinematography are excellent. The lighting and use of shadows... incredible. This does an amazing job of building suspense and tension. The plot is well-written, and the twists are impeccable. Every acting performance is spot-on. The characters are credible and well-developed, and the women are allowed strong-willed moments. MacMurray is rather cool. There is a little racism and sexism(on account of when it was made), some innuendo and brief mild and not graphic violence in this. I recommend this to everyone into these movies. 10/10  "
80551,tt0056172,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Beautifully shot epic,"I've heard plenty of things about this movie before I ever found out what it was about. The moment the music now famous as the piece that plays when we first see the desert came on, I recognized it from several movies and TV-shows. Though I didn't realize it until I saw him wearing them, I've seen Lawrence's Arabian clothes many times, several of these before I knew of the movie at all. I think that's what defines a true classic; that you know of it... before you're told. That it's ""everywhere"", in a sense. You can't really go anywhere without hearing about it at some point, because it was such an experience, it had such an impact on people. Everything that came later was in some way influenced by it, affected by it. The first thing that struck me about this film is how beautifully shot it is; at first, I couldn't quite muster up the effort to pay full attention, thinking about how long it would be(ADD victim = yours truly), but when I finally did, I couldn't take my eyes off it again. It was mesmerizing, captivating. I couldn't possibly express through mere words how amazing the visuals are... you have to see for yourself. Some say that the film is 'flashy', but every masterpiece has its critics. I'm certainly not one of this masterpiece's. The plot is well-written and develops nicely throughout the film. The pacing is very good, I was hardly bored at any point watching it(though it is quite a behemoth of a viewing experience... three hours and twenty minutes). The acting is top-notch, and Guinness, Sharif, Quinn and O'Toole are all magnificent. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography and editing are both state-of-the-art. Writing in general is excellent. The dialog is truly great, both as far as writing and delivery goes. This movie contains some highly memorable and impressive war scenes, as well, for anyone out there looking for that sort of thing. The film is a timeless classic that should be seen by just about anyone, regardless of their interest in fine film-making(which this is a prime example of) or historical accuracy(which this film seems to have more than its share of). I recommend this to anyone, but I suggest you make sure you have the patience for it. Put it on and watch it until the end. You won't regret it. I certainly didn't. 10/10  "
80846,tt0056592,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Amazing film," After hearing nothing but critical acclaim for this film, and the book it was based on, I finally got to see it. I am quite amazed at how well done this film is, and how timeless the theme is. I haven't read the book, but I'm considering it, just to see if there are any details that were left out. The story is amazing and exceptionally told. As far as I know, the film is as close to the book as it could possibly be; some call it the most accurate book-to-film conversion ever. The plot is very good, it takes a timeless problem and presents it to us, through the innocent eyes of a naive child. The pace is very good; apart from The Godfather(the first one) and one or two other exceptions, this is the only drama where there was truly not one single moment that I found dull, boring or unimportant. Nothing seemed trivial in the film. The perspective that is forced upon us is that of a young child, naive and innocent. This is a brilliant idea, as the eyes of a child is without a doubt one of the most impressionable things in the world, and the film handles this perfectly. What really makes the film, apart from the brilliant and possibly unique perspective, is the fact that the children are likable, credible and charming. You couldn't help but like them; believe me, normally I really dislike children. I find them annoying, loud and egotistical. But with this film, I couldn't, for one second, muster up any tiny amount of aggression, or even annoyance. They come off as so likable, charming, and, most importantly, *real*. Almost every kid in any Hollywood movie is either a completely ridiculous stereotype/clich«∏ of a brat, who does nothing but destroy things around him, or the exact opposite, a little angel. Everyone knows that no child is the latter all the time, and even I will admit that there probably doesn't exist too many children who are the first, either. In this film, the children are completely real. They are naive, innocent, they disobey what their father tells them, but ultimately, they obviously love and respect their father, and they never do anything, anything at all, with the intent to hurt or harm someone or something. That is what a child is; innocent. They do what they do because they do not know better. This film provides a perfect view into their world, or, rather, their perspective of it. The acting is excellent. The child actors exceed all expectations. I was amazed at how professional and convincing they were. The other actors all give great performances as well. The cinematography is excellent; once again, it gives a perfect perspective on what your surroundings look like when you're a child. The characters are well-written, credible and well-casted. The dialog was well-written. The script was excellent. A very memorable and beautiful film, should be viewed by almost anyone. I recommend this to anyone who likes dramas, and just about anyone who for one reason or another might enjoy this. Don't be scared off by it being over forty years old, or it being black and white; it's an excellent film, and just about anyone would enjoy it. Don't miss this perfect film. 10/10   "
81891,tt0338013,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Truly beautiful and surreal,"Wow... this had me spellbound. Deep, intimate piece. If one wasn't already convinced that Jim Carrey is an actor, not just a comedian, one would be so after taking this in. Winslet does incredible, as well(and both are playing against type), as does everyone else that I can think of(Dunst also impressed me). You have to pay attention during this, and a second viewing may help, but it's not so abstract and loose that it's difficult to understand. This is the third work of Charlie Kaufman's that I've seen(the other two are Being John Malkovich and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind), and by far my favorite. Anyone who has ever loved can relate to this. I can't promise it'll be pleasant, in fact, it's possible that it won't, but this is absolutely absorbing. This is mature, smart and does not try to distance itself, or its audience, from the subject matter. I haven't seen any other work by Gondry, but he directs this magnificently. Masterful visuals, and somehow apparently with little to no CGI. The editing and camera-work are excellent. Story-telling and characterization are of such high quality that I'm not sure words can do them justice. The ambiguity of the final moments is perfect. All of the special effects are amazing. The movie pulls you in, it is thoroughly engaging throughout. I'm not sure any viewer can avoid being affected by this. You may not recognize every scene as something from your own life, but the feelings, the impressions... they're universal. I don't remember when I've last been this into a big screen experience. Anyone who can watch films that are personal, and emotionally powerful should consider this. There is some strong language and sexual content, as well as drug references and the like. The DVD holds two featurettes, one of which I will review on its own page here on the site, interesting deleted scenes, a fake commercial, a music video, and an informative commentary track with the Michel and writer Charlie Kaufman, all of them also well worth your time. I recommend this to anyone who is or has been in a relationship, and who don't need their cinematic experiences spoon-fed. 10/10  "
83869,tt0093058,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,"Very close to perfection, but not entirely there","If I were to describe this movie with one word, I would say 'unsettling'. Then again, I suppose this could be said about most of Stanley Kubrick's films. I've seen a few of his films lately, and have become quite a fan of his work... so far I've seen A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey and this one(I've seen The Shining as well, but that was before I knew who Kubrick was and what kind of a director he was, so I didn't fully enjoy it). While I think both aforementioned titles are better than this one(if only slightly), I really did like this film. And while it isn't the best war film ever made, it is definitely one of the better. The film consists of two parts(though they aren't really that separated... and they are both parts of the same story), the first part being about the boot camp which trains the Marines, and the second one being about the Vietnam war. Both parts have essentially the same point and theme... and both deliver it quite well. However, there are a few flaws in the film... it seems uneven, somehow. Some of the scenes, especially in the beginning of the second part, seemed pointless and overlong. Kubrick is famed for his uncanny ability to set a mood and keep it, which makes his films more effective and even harder to watch than they were just with the chilling visuals and excellent use of music. However, here, he seemed almost lost for a few scenes... things didn't seem to go anywhere... maybe he's just not used to doing such a grand project... yes, he was a very ambitious director, with very big films on his resume... but I'm not sure if he had done something on this scale before(or after), so that might be it. Of course, this doesn't mean that the film is bad... not by a long shot. There were just a few scenes that seemed to have little importance... and the voice-over narration seemed tacked on, if you ask me. Like he was trying to implement it, but sufficed to just throwing it in here and there. The plot is great. The pacing is good, but not perfect. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written and credible. The music/score is excellent. Kubrick always manages to put in music that sounds really good in scenes that contain disturbing and unpleasant visuals to great effect. The film as a whole is a little flawed but I didn't find anything horribly wrong with the film. Great film with great theme. Any fan of Kubrick should enjoy this. This is possibly the most spoofed/referenced war film of all time... and it's the film that gave R. Lee Ermey the character that he would play for basically the rest of his career. That says something about how crafty and influential this film is, I think. I recommend this film to any fan of Stanley Kubrick and/or war movies. 9/10  "
84241,tt0062622,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,I am speechless...,"Having just seen this fantastic film, I'm left puzzled, amazed, impressed and in complete and utter awe of Kubrick's cinematic genius. I had not expected anything to impress me as much as A Clockwork Orange, but I was pleasantly surprised. While I do find A Clockwork Orange to be a better film, I must say that this comes incredibly close... and what determines this might be the fact that, while I fully understood A Clockwork Orange(at least after my second viewing) I'm quite confused by this film. I don't entirely understand the ending, and a few various things throughout the film, but that doesn't lower my score. Not the slightest. Do you know why? Well, partly because Arthur C. Clarke, the co-writer of the screenplay once said: ""If you understand 2001 completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we answered."" And partly because the very visuals of this film warrant a perfect rating of 10. I would be lying if I claimed to ever have seen such beautiful visuals as the ones throughout the film, and in particular the very end... stunning. Simply stunning. Something that I found interesting was how many times Kubrick simply used the visuals to tell the story(as opposed to dialog) and how often he simply let us enjoy the sight of the spacecrafts or the planets... instead of giving us a few unsatisfying quick cuts like a typical Hollywood director would have done. Kubrick is in no hurry to tell us this story... in fact, he wants us to relax and just be whisked away on this journey. He sets a mood like no other director has ever done, and he never breaks this mood. His use of music, while not as deliciously ironic as it is in A Clockwork Orange, is great. There are two scenes which have been referenced so many times, both content-wise and music-wise, in so many different mediums that I doubt anyone can keep track of how many parodies or references there are to them... this is, of course, the famous Dawn of Man scene, and a recurring external space scene. The plot is great. The pacing is good, considering that it's Kubrick... usually, his films are slower, but this one never really felt that slow. The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is all great. The music/score is great. The visuals of the film are amazing. I know I'm praising every aspect of the film here, but I truly think it is that good; it's one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and definitely the best visually. Finally, I'll just mention that normally I hate science fiction that deals(even slightly) with extraterrestrial activity/life and space travel. I recommend this film to any fan of high-quality science fiction and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. 10/10  "
86041,tt0208092,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Humorous and stylish British gangster flick," I haven't seen Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, which makes this the first Guy Ritchie film I've seen, and the only one I've seen so far. I had heard plenty of good things about this film, and I do believe that I've seen some of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels(though that didn't impress me much, actually), and after seeing some advertisements for this, I was looking forward to seeing it. I must say, it did meet my expectations, though it didn't exceed them. The plot is great, very interesting and constantly developing. It also has a good pace, you're never bored, which can also be attributed to the many quick cuts and great editing. The acting is great, I really enjoyed Brad Pitt and Vinnie Jones, not to mention Jason Statham, though they were all great, I think. The characters were diverse, well-written and credible, not to mention quite entertaining, though at times they became a little lame, in obvious attempts at humor. The action is great, though there is fairly little of it; it's mostly sacrificed for the sake of more humor. Don't get me wrong, the humor is mostly good too, but sometimes it just seems like there is too little action in it, though, when there is action, it's good. The camera work and overall filming style is, well, stylish, and looks very cool. I liked the use of slow-motion, fast-motion and instantly changing angles, not to mention the well-placed quick cuts. The way the diamond constantly changed hands in the film was great, though a fairly basic way to keep the plot going. I liked all of the things that didn't have anything to do with the diamond, like the gypsies and the boxing, but I did think the plot revolved a little too much around the diamond. All in all, a very entertaining film, that couldn't have been much better or much more professionally made, but was lacking a little. I recommend it to fans of British/violent humor, and fans of the actors. I guess people who liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels will enjoy this too, though I can't say for sure, as I haven't seen it. 8/10  "

Same if you want an action flick, in spite of the fact that the trailers do sort of make it look like one. What we have here is Tarantino(who's *probably* pretty much completely out of his mind), one of the world's biggest movie buffs, doing his thing, an homage to a sub-genre apparently called ""macaroni combat""(like ""spaghetti Western""), flicks that deal with the cathartic fantasy of the Third Reich's ""finest"" getting a big ol' spoonful of their own medicine shoved directly into their mouths. He yet again takes something he loves, a certain type of cinema, and makes something new and different out of it, without distorting it to the point where it is unclear what the root is. This is pure Quentin... full of unexpected twists, it'll make you laugh, squirm in your seat, enjoy the tunes and plain and simple, get you involved and engaged for two and a half hours where, while you can never know quite where the ride that he designed will take you, you're assured it'll be interesting and unforgettable. There are images that will stay in your mind, ideas you can't help but admire, and lines you'll find yourself quoting for a long time. The dialog... it's absolutely incredible, always well-delivered, and the use of properly spoken German, French and Italian, having subtitles and really doing something with that was fantastic. Story and plot are great and well-told, the non-linear time-line that our writer/director masters is used marvelously as usual. This is epic and amazing. Cinematography and editing are spot-on. The acting... Waltz is beyond reproach. He deserved the Cannes win. Pitt is impeccable. Roth, Fassbender, Schweiger... I could keep going. Groth and Wuttke *demand* mention as well. Myers, I realized what he played a mere second before he left the screen. Every performance is so powerful and genuine. Over the top when they need to be(there are a lot of caricatures herein), underplayed when that's the proper choice. The suspense and intensity this accomplishes is magnificent. I urge you to avoid spoilers as best as you can before watching this, and try to forget or avoid what the advertisements show you. When this goes for it, it is nasty, violent, bloody, gruesome, disturbing, has strong language and there's also brief sexuality. If you don't think you have the stomach for this, well, you may be right. I recommend this to everyone who does think that they do, and is into what QT does with the medium.

88606,tt0071853,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"Not as good as Life of Brian, but worth watching"," This Monty Python film is great, partly because it works on several levels; it works as a straight up typical Monty Python movie(which in itself ensures hilarity) and as a spoof of many of the old ""medieval times"" based films. The plot is pretty good, and less disjointed than that of other Monty Python creations, so if you're looking for a linear time line based film, then this might interest you. The plot does move along a little slowly, though, even for a Monty Python film(slower than Life of Brian, for example), and the film suffers a little under that. The jokes and sight gags make up for it, but it still does seem a little slow, especially on repeated viewings. The acting is good, as it typically is with Monty Python films. I can't really comment on the characters, but I guess they pretty much stay in character all through the film. The humor is good, but not as great as it is in Life of Brian, though that may be because I've seen it too many times. I don't know, I just wasn't really laughing at any point when I saw this. I knew that it was funny, and a few of the gags do stick in my mind as amusing, but when watching it I couldn't even muster up a slight chuckle. In fact, about an hour into the film, I was getting tired with the film, and hoped that it would end soon. I don't dislike the film, nor do I have anything against the humor, I just think I've grown tired with it. When it's not new and in-your-face anymore, it just loses impact, I guess. The film has plenty of entertaining sequences, and the gags and jokes are mostly quite good. It even has a few very memorable scenes, such as the the Black Knight scene, and the witch scene. The dialog is as sharp as the Python's dialog usually are, and there is more good dialog than there is in Life of Brian. All in all, a good Monty Python film, but just slightly inferior to Life of Brian. I recommend it to any fan of Monty Python, and fans of dark and silly humor in general. 8/10  "
89081,tt0119488,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,"Very good, but too slow and overly complicated","I decided to check out this film after hearing many good things about it, among others that it was the best film Curtis Hanson has made... and since Hanson also directed 8 Mile, a movie I enjoyed very much and have seen several times, I thought it would be worth watching. I wasn't mistaken. What I wasn't prepared for, however, was how darn slow it was... it never seemed to take off. Maybe it's the fact that there are almost constantly introduced new characters, maybe it's the fact that half of the actions in the film don't seem to have much of an impact on anything, other than move the plot a little bit forward(a tiny little bit)... I don't know. It never really captivated me, and I found myself often not paying that much attention to it. The film is good, no doubt about it... but it's just so slow... and in the end, it seems unrealistic. The very ending seems to be set up to throw in an action scene. The plot is good, but the pacing is bad. The script is good. The acting is great. The characters are well-written and well-acted. The dialog is well-written and well-delivered. The film has so much going for it, and, luckily, pulls most of if off perfectly. But that pacing is horrendous. I haven't read the novel which this film is based on, but I think that the film does it justice... anyway, that's what the author says on one of the featurettes on the DVD. The dialog has several memorable lines, the characters are conflicted and not immediately likable, but you eventually grow to like them, the script has some great scenes... but the pacing just... no. Maybe it had something to do with how hard it was for me to tell Kevin Spacey's and Russell Crowe's characters apart, partly because they looked alike and partly because both characters acted alike. I liked this movie, but I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't bored out of my mind for about a fourth of the run-time, scattered around the film. Too long and too big, in my opinion... but not bad. I recommend this to fans of Curtis Hanson, neo-noir drama-mystery-thrillers and any of the actors involved in it. 9/10  "
89256,tt0059578,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,7,A pretty good western," Clint Eastwood is pretty much the king of westerns. And when the western is being directed by Sergio Leone, you know it good spaghetti-western entertainment. However, this one seemed a little repetitive and predictable. At times it seemed to repeat itself endlessly. Either talking or shooting, none of them moving the plot forward or getting any further with the movie. It just seemed to much like filler. The plot is OK, but seems too much like an excuse to put Clint and Lee Van Cleef in some scenes where they could show off their icy stares and their poker-faces. The acting is good enough for a western. The soundtrack is not as good as in ""The good, the bad and the ugly"", but almost. The action seemed a little too repetitive, and lacked the ingenuity of ""The good, the bad and the ugly"". Overall, a pretty good western, but just not as good as the next part of the trilogy(The good, the bad and the ugly). I haven't seen the first part, ""A fistful of dollars"" yet, but I'll see it as soon as I get a chance, so I can find out which part is the best.

The man certainly was an artist. The concept smoothly avoids being a gimmick, as it could easily have turned into in the hands of someone not sufficiently talented, and is instead a well-used device, through which base human emotions and responses are explored, as well as relationships, good and evil, and more. Any piece of expression that so skillfully encourages its audience to think - without ever seeming like a lecture - should be respected and appreciated. The story-telling is excellent. The acting is spot-on, from all involved. The minimal cast and amount of settings are well-utilized, and keeps the focus sharp. The plot never loses the viewers' interest, and in fact only gets increasingly deep and fascinating as it goes. While the subject of this is a sexual crime, the way it's handled is immensely tasteful. The visuals are impeccable, and cinematography and editing are amazing. This could arguably, along with much of Hitchcock's work, be cited as the origins of the utter tidal wave of ""twist endings""(often overshadowing all else about those movies, including, but not limited to, consideration being put into ensuring that said surprise even makes sense) that have hit popular cinema in recent years, however, milestones sometimes do cause negatives, and they shouldn't be blamed for that. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys being challenged, and is willing to give the medium of film the chance to prove itself as possessing the potential to be a form of art. 10/10  "
90327,tt0086250,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"A good, convincing portrayal of a fictional Cubans rise to power in the underworld of America"," After watching this again, I realize that I may have praised this film a little too much. Therefore, this is the more down-to-earth review. A lot of people compare this film to Godfather; granted, there are similarities, but Godfather is the better film. The entire Godfather trilogy(apart from possibly part III) is better than this film, as a whole trilogy and as individual films. Godfather has the better actors, the better script and the better film, as a whole. Sure, Scarface has some good talents, a somewhat good script, and is a pretty good film, but it doesn't compare to the greatness of Godfather. The plot is good, it has a pretty good pace, and it's fairly interesting. The acting is good, with Al Pacino and Michelle Pfeiffer giving pretty good performances, and most of the rest being reasonably good. The thing is, Scarface is more of an action film than a regular crime-drama; it has a body-count several times the size of the one that Godfather has. What you make of that is up to you, but personally I prefer quality over quantity. Every time someone was ""hit"" in one of the Godfather films, it was special, and often unique. There were several actual shoot-outs in this film, and it quickly got fairly uninteresting, as they didn't have the intensity of a regular action film, and felt a little out of place in a crime-drama. The overall tone of this film was more violent than Godfather's tone, and, at times, the film felt like it was mainly about putting in as much graphic violence as possible. It was good, no doubt about that, it just wasn't great. I have yet to see the original Scarface, but I hear it's much better, so I'll have to check it out soon. All in all, a pretty good gangster film, pretty good crime-drama, but just inferior to Godfather. Watch it to get a good, gritty and nothing less than realistic view on organized crime in the 1980's. Listen to the great theme, maybe be shocked at the gruesome violence, and learn, that ultimately, crime doesn't pay. I recommend this to fans of gangster movies and crime-dramas, fans of Brian De Palma(I guess, though I can't really remember what else he's done that's worth watching), and people who are interested in films about organized crime. Worth checking out. 8/10  "
91422,tt0017136,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Spellbinding from start to finish,"I base this upon the version that runs just under two hours in length. This is my second exposure(the title that was the first is M, from 1931) to German expressionism and Fritz Lang, the cinematic genius, and it most definitely will not be the last of either. I could not take my eyes off this for a second. It would be a lie to claim that I could remember when I was last this engaged by a motion picture that I was watching, and I'm honestly not certain that I expected it to be as excellent in that aspect as it turned out to be. Cinematography is masterful. This is incredible for how influential, groundbreaking and unconventional it was when they made it, but not only that. The pacing is spot-on, this is never boring. It is not for everyone, and casual movie-goers may not be as captivated by this as I was. It's cut surprisingly fast, and it all goes far beyond what you'd expect them to be able to accomplish at the time. Heck, not only that, the effects are genuinely marvelous, and this holds amazing images that I've not seen anywhere before or since. This, with the futuristic city and the massive machines, has an astonishing, often bleak, look and feel, and builds atmosphere remarkably well. The moral holds up to this day, as does the commenting on industrialism(to an extent) and capitalism(much moreso). This is a silent film(for those unaware, dialog is handled by a black screen with white text on it, and in this, so were a number of stage directions), and apart from some sound-work, all of which is impeccable, the audio side is exclusively music, and this sweeping, instrumental score fits every frame of this, and probably had its role in me being so drawn into this. This is set in the aptly named Metropolis, decades from now(it was when this was made), where the working force, that keeps it all running, is living underground, while the high class spend their lives in carefree enjoyment. Until one day, where the son of the man who planned it falls for a woman trying to improve the situation for the laborers. The acting is impeccable. I recommend this to anyone whose appreciation of the medium goes beyond taking in one or two now and then. 10/10  "
91583,tt2106476,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,Do you seriously think I hurt her?,"Lucas(Mikkelsen doing incredible, and his role, fortunately, in spite of early indications towards it, is *not* a Gary Stu) is a fairly content 42-year-old. His biggest problem is his ex-wife only letting him see their son every other weekend, and after he whines(seemingly an exorbitant amount, even for a teenager), this gets changed. So things are looking up. But then, he faces an accusation of pedophilia, and as things escalate(eventually leading to a few holes punched in the overall credibility), the tension rises(thankfully occasionally pierced(never disappearing completely), made tolerable, by the clever humor - such as our lead's dog barking at every mention of the name of his former bride), and as we realize how easily this could happen to us, we can't escape the terrifying consequences of such a claim... even when it is false. It is completely evident to us that it is not true, and it is about this situation. This does not suggest that the awful crime never happens, but it does shine a light on the fact that we are looking for it everywhere, and many refuse to accept the court's word when someone is found to not have done it. Part of the problem is the idea that we are ""innocent"" until puberty, and our still strained relationship with sexuality. Let me make clear, it should of course never be between kids and adults... however, even at a young age, there may be curiosity, and this is not a bad thing, it's natural and should not be discouraged(lest they actually *do* get issues about it!). The characterization has no one a ""good or bad guy"", we understand everyone and their actions. And the acting is impeccable from everyone concerned. Theo(Bo Larsen, capturing the complexity) is forced to choose between who to believe... his best friend since childhood, or his beloved daughter! And the girl herself, Klara(Wedderkopp, who shows amazing talent... when she is asked to repeat her story to a therapist, we perceive her increasing nervousness through a minor tic with her lower lip; no words needed, and holding up to the scrutiny of close-ups), is as full and real a person as if she were a grown-up. The score is sparse and this uses silence well, rendering it more intimate. We start in the idyllic(the whole thing is set in a small town, and in addition to being ""short"" or ""code"" for witch-hunt, the title can be applied literally), with everyone happy, everything quaint, and as it progresses, this gets further away, to the point where we begin to wonder if we imagined that. The pace does at times drag a tad, and the third act doesn't feel entirely like a climax(in spite of how scary it gets over the course of the 112 minutes). While I have mixed feelings about the very ending, it is in the right spirit. This is a mature, intelligent take on the subject, and will stir up a much-needed debate. Thomas Vinterberg has made another film as good as The Celebration(and I love Submarino). There is a lot of disturbing content, some bloody violence, and brief male full frontal nudity(and references to such) in this. I recommend this to everyone who can ""handle it"". 9/10  "
92145,tt0119217,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"Impressive, if just a bit predictable","This is the writing debut of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. Yep. They wrote this movie. I had a hard time believing it when I read it, too. Something that made it easier to believe what that I read in the trivia section that they originally wrote it as more of a Hollywood-like film, with government conspiracies and such. Luckily, they were advised to drop everything but the core drama. The result is this very interesting and thoroughly entertaining film. The story of one young man with vast, unused talent. Like many other dramas, this is based primarily in the dialog and the characters. Some of the most interesting scenes in the film are those where you see the interaction, the conversations between Damon and Williams. They play off each other very nicely. Gus Van Sant's fairly vague and undistinguished directorial style fits the story well, and I really enjoyed the usage of the cameras in the fight scene early in the film. The film has plenty of clever writing, mainly noticeable in the dialog. The plot is very good. The pacing is mostly good, though the film gets a tad slow every once in a while. Near the end I felt like it could have been shorter without hurting the film. The acting is all top-notch, though some of the dialects could have used a bit more work. Something that bothered me a bit about the end was how inconclusive and yet Hollywood-like it was. We don't really know what happens to Will Hunting after the film... but we get the feeling that he's going to be fine. I prefer the ending to 8 Mile, which was a good bit more ambiguous. In the end, a pretty good writing debut, and a solid directing effort by Van Sant. I recommend this to fans of dramas and the various names involved in it. 8/10  "
93344,tt0372784,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Off to a great start,"At a time when it was thought that this movie franchise was beyond any possible rescue, this was put together. What I got when I sat down in the theater, over three years ago, and the lights were turned off was a very pleasant, and rather welcome surprise. First off, let me make it clear that Nolan takes appropriate time introducing and building up before the superhero aspect turns up at all. A lot of this is spent on back-story, Bruce's as well as that of other important characters. With that said, my hat's off to Christopher... I'm not sure any other director has the same understanding of what makes Bruce Wayne and his alter ego tick. The motivation, the determination, terrifying his enemies... perfect. The way bats(the animal) are used in this is magnificent. Whenever Batman attacks henchmen, we see it from their angle... not his. This is fantastic, and works really well. The other action scenes, however, the fighting and such, at their worst, do arguably reveal that the director is not used to this kind of film; most of the shots are at medium range, and about half of them are dark. To put it bluntly: There are points where you can't see a thing. Another thing that bothered me was that this seems too eager regarding some of the surprises. At least once or twice, I sat waiting for something I knew would come, to happen. Apart from those somewhat minor complaints, this feature is excellent. The plot is well thought-out and it pays off. The dialog is brilliant. The humor is good, almost every single line that tries to be clever succeeds. The performances are top-notch, all-round. Neeson is marvelous, as are Bale, Caine and Oldman. Holmes is above average. The direction is very stylish, and this bears resemblance to a psychological thriller. It would have been nice, though, if they went for more complexity than ""fear"" seeming to be the one thing they focus on. The attempt to make the story and villains seem more realistic and believable went well. I wasn't a huge fan of the new Batmobile when I first saw it in previews, but... just wait until you see it. In fact, there's a car-chase involving it that almost alone is worth watching this for. The equipment and weapons are easier to look at when it's explained as something that very well could exist in the real world. I especially liked the idea behind Scarecrow. I won't reveal it here. Also, I would like to give Mr. N two thumbs up on his decision to use primarily practical effects, with little to no CGI. It looks better and is enormously credible. The atmosphere is expertly achieved. As the very last thing: This really isn't a superhero flick. It's a moral tale of a man and his fight for either vengeance or justice. He wears the suit for a reason. There is a little moderately strong language, no sexuality and material dealing with drugs. I recommend this to any fan of the comics, any of the actors and/or any of the genres. Do be sure to know what to expect from it. This is not colorful, and definitely not campy. It's dark, brooding and bleak. Fits like a glove. 8/10  "
95339,tt0053291,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,One of the best romantic comedies of all time," For being such an old film, this was hilarious. It's especially filled with little nice touches, things than the moment when you see them, you can't help but laugh. A lot of the humor makes fun of the mob, a little of it is even black humor. When I sat down to watch it, I had no idea it was so unbelievably funny. The humor is pretty much constant, there is mostly something to laugh at every single minute of the entire movie. Something that's great about the humor is that it comes off as naturally funny, it doesn't try too hard to be funny. Tony Curtis was great, so was Jack Lemmon; even Marilyn Monroe was pretty good in this movie. This movie has some of the funniest moments ever seen on film, and should be viewed by pretty much everyone who's into romantic comedies. I've only seen it once so far, but I have a feeling that I'll watch it many more times. It's one of those films that never get old. I recommend this to anyone who takes just a little pleasure in watching romantic comedy and don't mind that it's black and white. 10/10  "
96047,tt0105695,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,A masterpiece in nuance,"This is probably Eastwood's best, as far as both directing and starring. The depth and the lack of black and white or judgment are astonishing. Every single character is well-written, credible, developed thoroughly and a *human being*. Not one of them is limited to only one side to their personality, everyone is flawed... the antagonist is arguably not a ""bad guy"", and you can get behind him and see things his way. This does not present us with right and wrong, it offers differing points of view, and allows the audience to decide for ourselves what we think. Food for thought, not a raised index finger. The script comes from the man who would later give us Twelve Monkeys and Soldier(no, it wasn't brilliant, but that wasn't his fault, Webb Peoples gave them a great start-off point, blame Paul W.S. Anderson), and the plot is relatively simple and easy to follow(not to be confused with predictable), so that the focus can be put on exploring the people. This portrait of the fictional William Munny is entirely unforgettable, immensely insightful and ultimately quite tragic. The level of realism that is present in every area of this is impeccable(the one thing I can think of that strains credulity is the presence of an African-American who isn't a slave, but with how incredible Freeman's performance is, I can forgive it), sets, costumes, dialog, language, relationships, etc. This has excellent and spot-on acting all the way; heck, even the kids aren't too bad. The editing and cinematography are amazing, and this holds several gorgeous and memorable images. This is not about action, it's an engaging drama set in the Wild West. With that said, there is definitely thick tension, as well as exciting scenes in this(and they neither are, nor feel, out of place in the least). There is a lot of brutal, bloody and unpleasant violence, a bit of disturbing content, occasional swearing and a little sexuality and references to such in this. I recommend this warmly to everyone mature enough to handle and appreciate it. 10/10  "
96658,tt0041959,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,This liberation isn't what I had expected it to be,"This is the only Carol Reed film I've watched so far, and I most definitely do not intend it to be the last. The story is immediately engaging, and the setting, post-WWII Vienna, where crime is an all too common thing, is stunning and draws you in. This also has amazing cinematography and editing, with some camera angles that I have not seen in anything from the late 40's, or many other places, for that matter. The lighting is also gorgeous. I understand that this is British Noir, a sub-genre I don't believe I've been exposed to before. The script is marvelous. Every character is great, well-developed and credible, and the dialog is all sharp and delivered with perfect timing. The plot is brilliant, compelling and intriguing, and not so convoluted that you can't follow it, or even require a second viewing to piece it all together, and the mystery and its conclusion are satisfying. Every acting performance is spot-on, and there is a lot of charm and chemistry to it. Heck, *the kid*, whose age I cannot possibly imagine had hit double digits at the time, is quite good, and certainly convincing. This actually uses other languages than English when it makes sense, German and Russian, often broken. Tension and suspense is built up well in this. The only negative I can really say about this is that the score, whenever it appears in the last half of the picture, is disruptive and draws attention to itself in how little it fits in tone with what's going on. I have experienced that in other older movies. There is a bit of disturbing content and brief mild to moderate violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it, and this type of fiction. 10/10  "
96753,tt0363163,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,A chillingly accurate portrayal of Der F«¨hrer and the fall of The Third Reich,"Adolf Hitler. The very name is enough to send a chill down your spine. Not because of what it is or was, but because of what it stands for, what we involuntarily and immediately think of when we are reminded of him. The deaths of so many people and the cause of so much evil. Now, almost sixty years after his death, we finally get a chance to see his downfall, his last hours and days... and this turns out to be a very revealing portrayal. Oliver Hirschbiegel takes what so many people have tried to turn into a monster and makes it human again, makes us believe that this man actually existed and was a man, not a beast. We see Hitler's frustration at defeat, his kindness to his employees, his refusal to accept the truth. The plot is very good, and almost completely authentic. I could only find two historical inaccuracies in the film, and that is incredible, compared to the amount of stuff that was as if taken directly from the history book or another equally reliable source. The pacing is great. I was hardly bored at any point during the film, despite it being quite long and the language spoken was one I couldn't understand(thank god for subtitles). With that said, I have to applaud this film's realism and authenticity. Every single German character in the film speaks German. There are a few scenes with Russian characters as well... and they naturally speak Russian. Not English with a poorly faked accent, like we generally see in Hollywood films. In fact, there is not really any Hollywood in the film. Just gritty, hard realism. No heroic acts that are rewarded. No 'fireball' explosions. No holding back on injuries, even when it comes to 'our heroes'. Actually, that's probably what impressed me the most(when it comes to non-Hollywood stuff in this film); there are no heroes. No one is raised above the rest, no one is pure, good and true *all the time*... no one is a hero. Everyone is a human being. The acting is flawless. Bruno Ganz is a perfect choice for Adolf Hitler. No, scratch that; THE perfect choice. You forget that you're watching an actor. You're completely absorbed by his performance. The casting was mostly spot-on, with most of the historical characters looking and acting just like they did in real life. The details are another thing that raises this film to a new level. The tiniest little things in these people's lives, the most human and typical things are presented as they are or were, in the film. Hitler's Parkinson's disease, Goebbels' slight limp, etc. Smaller details include a soldier quickly rubbing his eyes of soot and gunpowder before looking through binoculars and a brief dialog showing Hitler and his promises' effect on many Germans, even children. This is just so talented directing, it's hard to say anything negative. The editing is sharp and the cinematography is perfect. Not one shot lasts too long or ends too early. A few things were changed(from the historical record of what happened) for dramatical reasons, but it didn't bother me and probably won't be a deal-breaker for anyone else(it really shouldn't, anyway, except maybe for historians who go for nothing but authenticity and accuracy). The one thing I will say is that no one should go see this movie unless they are absolutely certain of what they're in for, when it comes to violence and realism. This is gratuitous and detailed, no holding back. Not for the faint of heart. Definitely not. Also, you will need somewhat extensive knowledge of Hitler and the people around him in that time, or you won't really understand what is going on. Read up on him or watch a Discovery Channel special first, then watch the film. I recommend this to just about anyone who can tolerate the language(I don't know if there is a dubbed version of this film, but in my honest opinion, you should stay away from any other version than the original) and the violence, and, most importantly, the idea that Hitler was a human being, not some supernatural, cold-hearted monster. 10/10  "
97970,tt0095016,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,The best of its kind," Most of us action-film fans have seen movies that follow this basic idea; hostages trapped in a building, police can't gain access and the only hope is one man, who's inside at that exact time, by pure coincidence. However, this one, I suspect, is one of the first of this kind, if not the first. It's also by far the best of this kind. This one set the bar for action films to come, and most of the cliches from films of this kind actually originated in this one. It has the perfect mix of humor, action and thriller. Bruce Willis is perfect as the wisecracking action-hero, and Reginald VelJohnson is great as the cop, and Alan Rickman is excellent as the terrorist leader. The plot is great, probably the best I've seen in this type of action film. It keeps a fairly good pace throughout the film, except for just a few scenes which lack intensity, but maybe that's just because I've seen it so many times, and know what happens. The acting is almost flawless. The humor is great, Bruce Willis redefines wisecracking with his funny remarks throughout the film. The action is intense, on a great scale and well-filmed, which is what you'd expect when the director is John McTiernan, who is quite experienced in making great action films. All in all, a great action film, definitely the best of its kind, and should be enjoyable to just about anyone who just mildly enjoys action films. I recommend it to fans of action films in general, but specifically for fans of this particular sub-genre. 8/10  "
98804,tt0113277,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,The best at several things,"This is undoubtedly Mann's finest, and I'm not sure even he, himself, can really top it. If you ever wanted to know about crime in L.A., this is what to watch. The plot is excellent, and consistently told well, so that the audience never loses track, and in spite of great complexity, it manages to not be difficult to follow. Every single performance in this is spot-on and effective, from the two acting veteran leads through the young and always talented Portman, and to the smallest, briefest role. The characters are all fleshed out, credible and interesting. This doesn't take sides. It gives insight into the private lives of people on both sides of the law, those who uphold it as well as those who break it. Not everyone is in a positive light, but no one is unfairly treated by the presentation of that type of person, and the word ""one-note"" is simply not part of Michael's vocabulary when he penned the marvelous script. The emotion is genuine, and this is immensely involving and engaging from first to last frame. This is long, however, which hopefully will not deter any possible viewers. It's around three hours long, give or take twenty minutes, depending on the version. There is a little humor, at least worth chuckles, and it isn't trying to leave you in stitches. The dialog is sharp and impeccably delivered, often saying a lot with few lines. This has concise social commentary. It also has magnificent suspense and tension. Production values leave nothing to be desired. The action is among the most unforgettable committed to celluloid since its invention. Realism is sky-high, with next to no Hollywood(in fact, in all aspects of this), and I kid you not, when those guns go off, you can *feel* it. Nothing fancy, no stylization. Instead, every shot comes off as having an impact, as being dangerous. People actually reload, accuracy is an issue and the firearms can't magically handle whatever situation they're used in. Pretty much any moment of this that has bullets flying is epic. The ending is amazing, if I do argue with the very last bit. Hey, MM and finales... anyway, it doesn't bother me enough to lower my rating any. There is a lot of strong language, and some bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of drama who can stomach it. 10/10  "
99121,tt0071315,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"A noir masterpiece, possibly even a timeless classic...","While I don't care too much for Roman Polanski's style of direction(maybe I'll grow to like it eventually, maybe not), I can't deny that this is a truly great film. Jack Nicholson really shines through in his role, and his acting in this film perfectly fits the character... his shark smile, his voice, his tone... all of it, perfect. I always thought, when watching films with Nicholson, that he'd make a great lead in a noir film, so when I found this film and discovered that it was indeed noir, I naturally saw it as soon as possible. I found the film to have a slightly slower pace than what I would have preferred or expected, but apart from that minor detail, it was flawless. The plot is great, and thoroughly interesting and involving. The pacing, while not fast all the time, is more than acceptable. There are sequences that are really intense and exciting. The acting is great... like I said earlier, Nicholson shines through and really takes this character and makes him his own. The characters are well-written and credible. The special effects are well-done and still hold up pretty well. The dialog is very well-written and memorable. There are quite a few quotable lines, as well. The cinematography is good, and even when the plot doesn't move a lot, Polanski keeps our interest through interesting angles and sequences. I liked that there was often something subtle going on in the background, while we're focusing on what's directly in front of us. While Polanski certainly doesn't possess the attention to detail that Kubrick does, he manages to put a good bit of detail into many of the shots, and there is fairly little left to coincidence or chance, much like Kubrick. The film has a few twists that are quite good, and they come as surprises... I don't think I really saw them coming, and I doubt anyone would be able to. Of course, some might not find the twists to be that impressive, but the story stands on it's own nicely as well. This is a great movie, which should be seen by just about anyone who can take it(it's more than just casually adult in nature, even though there's not that much violence or sex in it). I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys film noir, watching Jack Nicholson in perfect shape in a role that was tailor-made for him, a good mystery, Roman Polanski's direction and just a good movie with a more adult tone that many others. 10/10  "
100922,tt0457430,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Not for me, but I'm not going to deny that it is excellent","Many aren't going to believe the following; I have never been into faerie tales. I questioned the logic, the concept of pure evil, etc., from when I first heard them. And honestly, when I initially came into contact with Del Toro's work(with Mimic, possibly nearly ten years ago by now), I did not care for it. It's pretty clear to anyone who's seen any of the flicks by him that he is big on fantasy. And you know what? I didn't love this, but I can be objective enough to see that it is a brilliant piece, and that is largely because of him. He injects such ample amounts of imagination and creativity(and unlike Hellboy 2, he focuses properly, and doesn't put an excess of beings up on the screen, so *everything* otherworldly in this has an impact). This feels like one of the classic stories, and I really mean that, not the Disney-fied, sanitized version, no, the original, from when they were written down and further back. If you don't already know, let me make it clear to you; this is *not* for children. It is an adult film(stop snickering), with themes and visuals not for young minds and eyes. This is disgusting, creepy, grotesque and unpleasant. It is not for everyone. The editing and cinematography, in general, the look of this, is just *gorgeous*. Every acting performance is spot-on. I am thoroughly impressed by the 11-year-old Baquero. To be that talented at that age is always noteworthy. Doug Jones is *the* man you want to put in heavy make-up, and he yet again proves his outstanding dedication. The effects and live-action elements meld rather well. There is a lot of graphic, bloody violence and disturbing content, as well as, apparently, a little strong language(meanwhile, I don't speak Spanish well enough to tell, so...) in this. The DVD holds a brief intro by Guillermo, where he says that this came close to killing him. From the Trivia, he clearly put a ton of effort into this, and it truly paid off. Whether or not you like this or any other movie of his, in my book, he deserves respect. I recommend this to any fan of the genre. 10/10  "

As they try to deal with their mother's illness, they experience amazing things with the imaginative creatures, including King Totoro, a large, fuzzy teddy-bear that smiles a lot and the many-legged Catbus. I suppose the main argument against this is the lack of real conflict(and without that, you don't really have a story), and the fact that the 10-year-old Satsuki(gesundheit) and the 4-year-old Mei can be rather obnoxious. Some will say that this doesn't need it; it's about the enchanting world(and it certainly is that). In addition to the magic, this does paint a convincing picture of the situation. This builds an atmosphere so effortlessly you barely believe it. The animation is smooth and ""feels"" real, including the setting of rural Japan, decades ago. There is a nice level of expression to the faces, especially the eyes. A cynic of many years, I will admit that this *did* win me over, yes, it is cute, the youngest of the 2 siblings is adorable(at times). There is some realistic kid dialog in this. The acting is great. If this does not tug at your heartstrings at least a bit, it may be time for a checkup. This is a truly well-done, sweet film that you can show children and they may love it, and it *isn't* pure garbage made with the sole intent being profit. There is nothing offensive in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this, one for Kiki's Delivery Service and one for Howl's Moving Castle. I recommend this to any fan of fantasy. 8/10  "

This is another slapstick gem. The timing, planning and execution are all spot-on, with most scenes featuring material building to a climax. A lot of the humor comes from the predicament of being trapped in a cabin with little to no food, as well as the sweet(simple, yes, but also enjoyable) romance. There is a real optimism about humanity here, and it is utterly infectious. The universal and age-old themes brought up keep it relevant after nearly 90 years. All this while the thin line between comedy and tragedy grows ever slimmer, nearly disappearing at points. Pacing and score keep certain bits from being terrifying, and make them comical instead. From a technical standpoint, this is well-done. Production values are fairly high, with FX that, while not seamless, have aged well. There is some violence and other disturbing content in this, though the majority of it is funny - not at the expense of those it happens to, we're laughing with, not at, them.

A friend of mine had recommended to check this out, and that I should go for the Director's Cut version. So naturally I got quite excited when I found this in said rental store and noticed that it was indeed the Director's Cut. When I finally sat down to watch it, I was immediately engrossed in the action. Not long after it starts, something happens. Then the movie kind of slows down... a lot. It keeps that slow pace for a very long time... and then something happens again... and it returns to the slow pace. The whole movie is like that... mostly slow, with a burst of action here and there. I don't know if this was on purpose or not... but as a result, I found the movie mostly dull. Just for the record, I wasn't expecting a huge action-packed sci-fi shoot-everything-you-see extravaganza. The plot is pretty good, just very oddly paced. The acting is pretty much flawless. The actors playing Replicants have to portray a adult characters with the emotional maturity of a young child... and they pull it off perfectly. The special effects are amazing; quite an accomplishment for the time the film was made. *MINOR SPOILERS* One of my biggest problems with this film is that the investigative portion of the film doesn't seem to hold water... Deckard pretty much runs into each of the Replicants casually, rather than figure out where they are, or where they will go. *END SPOILERS* Now, what I found great about this film(and the main reason everyone loves it, I would suspect) is the great theological and ethical questions it asks. Chief of them would probably be: If we actually created Artificial Intelligence(A.I.), would it be right to consider them lesser creatures... as opposed to equals? It also demonstrates how everything we create are for our own use, not for the greater good. And how everything we create, we exploit and use. The film holds many truths about human nature and much food for thought, stuff that will create discussions between you and your friends... but not enough. Having watched this so close to my second viewing of Abre Los Ojos, I can't help but compare... and this just loses right away. In the end, this is a very good sci-fi film with astounding visuals and some depth, but I fail to see how it's the best sci-fi film of all time. I recommend this to fans of science fiction, particularly of the works of Philip K. Dick(since apparently this is a very accurate representation of his novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep... one I have yet to find and read). Be prepared for a oddly paced and somewhat slow film, though. 8/10  "
103794,tt0050976,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Our crusade was such madness that only a real idealist could have thought it up,"This is the first film by Bergman I've watched, and I definitely do not intend to make it my last. The plot is smart and interesting, and it is compelling from start to finish. During a game of chess between The Grim Reaper itself and the man he has come to take, subjects like faith, life and death are explored. It's rather compelling, and ought to inspire many a healthy debate about aforementioned broad topics. The open and seemingly ambiguous nature of the movie allows the audience to interpret it for ourselves. This is funny at points, once or twice from absurdity, and it never tries too hard. It comes naturally, the clever and witty material as well as the black comedy. The acting is excellent, not a single performance is off for a second. It's really cool to see Sydow, by all respects a great talent, in his native tongue. This is beautifully shot and skillfully edited, if the sound can be a tad excessive at times. The music does also get loud and over the top a little, though it does not put much of a strain on the viewing experience. There is disturbing content in this, as well as brief violence and a few gruesome visuals. The DVD contains an introduction with Ingmar himself, which is three minutes long. I recommend this to anyone who is mature enough to appreciate it. 10/10  "
104282,tt0120735,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Hilarious and engaging,"The stingy Tom(Flemyng), seemingly clean-cut but deep-down possibly insane Soap(Fletcher), the fence Bacon(Statham) and the card-shark Eddie(Moran) are no strangers to the world of small or big-time crime of London's East End(which is the sole environment this takes place in, and it really brings it to the screen), and they've got 25K each, totalling at 100, which is the entry fee for the big game(that last-mentioned intends to win, bringing home quite a lot for the four) with Hatchet-Harry(Moriarty). It doesn't go as planned, and as his name might suggest to you, the H is not someone you want to owe money(he could send Barry the Baptist(McLean) at you... why call him that? 'cause he likes to drown people), and they have a week to come up with it. Meanwhile, their neighbours are planning to rob a group of pot-growers of their product and the wealth of profit it has brought in so far, and there are two antique rifles(hence the title) in play as well, and the various factions(did I mention there's a Samoan mob in this, too? The leader looks adorable, until he opens his mouth and threatens death and destruction, and you find yourself trusting him on that) are all after one or more of these items, either for what they're worth or because they have to, for someone else. There are a ton of mix-ups(the audience are the only ones to know everything that happens), and in addition to these surprising twists and turns, this is kept going a lot through the golden, quotable dialog(note that most of it is full of slang from the local area, and if you're not familiar with such, you may need subtitles to follow this) and these situations where people are threatened by this or that circumstance or person. This is a gangster-comedy-thriller, with a macho, very *guy* sense of humor to it. A lot of the fun comes from the quirk, as well. Ritchie loves him some dumb hustlers(here and in Snatch), and he plays with the camera and editing with the grace of a virtuoso, leading to a visually stylized film that never bores you. The characters are distinct, and for the sheer amount, that is as impressive a feat as how much screen time and development are actually afforded the lot of them. Everyone is well-cast and the acting is great. The types here are priceless. Vinnie Jones portrays an enforcer, as he should. This keeps to a marvelous pace. The 100 minutes fly by. There is a lot of brutal, bloody violence, strong language, crude references and a little nudity/sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this. I recommend this to any fan of Guy, the leads and the British disposition. 8/10  "
104582,tt0347149,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,I hate gunfire. No manners,"I haven't read the novel by Dianne Wynne Jones that this is loosely based on(but I understand that while this is not that direct of an adaptation, she is very happy with how it turned out). The young Sofie, a girl who doesn't feel attractive, becomes the victim of a spell that ages her. She then becomes the cleaning lady at the titular legged, moving castle of a powerful, selfish yet insecure young sorcerer Hauru, who she is infatuated with. We go with her on the ride to this amazing world of magic(in the universe this takes place in, it's almost commonplace) and quirky, strange and imaginative creatures, including a helpful living scarecrow, a charming, small and very old dog and the fire demon Calcifer(that eats egg shells and such to sustain himself). The focus is not on a ton of different creatures, settings or curses; the ones there are, are hypnotic, unforgettable and effective. This builds atmosphere and really gets to you, taking the time to draw you in, instead of the often scared-to-stand-still American norm(just because animation *can* move fast doesn't mean it always should). There is real personality to the locations, the beings and of course the characters. The sheer level of creativity and detail here is spellbinding. This has a great plot, if it is perhaps a tad vague at times and leaves you with unnecessary questions. I watched this with the original Japanese voices and subtitles, and I would definitely say that is the best way to go. The acting is spot-on. This has a marvelous score. While some of the humor is pretty silly, this is also genuinely funny at times. It can also be rather cute and sweet. This is 110 minutes sans credits. The art and designs are breathtaking, with little CGI. There is disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a 19 and a half minute featurette about how they animated the walking structure, a 7 and a half minute interview with the author of the book and a couple of TV spots and trailers. I recommend this to any fan of Anim«∏. 10/10  "
104644,tt0112641,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Odds are great you'll enjoy this,"This is based on 2-Disc Special Edition release. I have not read the book, nor did I know anything about the real people this was based(apart from what's on the Trivia page). And yes, in case you have heard... this is quite similar to Goodfellas. There's the obvious, such as Pileggi writing the novels behind both, and some of the same cast. Beyond that, though, the story-telling(such as the frequent and effective use of voice-over monologues, and multiple narrators, I could go on) and overall flavor are similar. And why not? It fits for one as well as the other and they're well-done and not the exact same film(having watched one does not mean you've already seen the other, I'll put it that way). The plot is engaging and interesting throughout. Characters are credible, well-developed and consistent. The acting is excellent, for everyone involved(including the kids). DeNiro and Pesci nail their roles, Stone gives what may be the most powerful performance of her career, and Woods is spot-on as always when given appropriate material. The dialog is impeccable, with countless memorable and well-delivered lines. Cinematography and editing are marvelous. The music is great, the score well-composed, and they are used expertly throughout this. This has constant strong language, plenty of brutal, bloody violence, disturbing content and a bit of sexuality. The DVD holds deleted scenes(among them an outtake or two) and six featurettes, four of which are on this site, and that I will review individually, the last two being a documentary called Vegas and the Mob and an episode of a History Channel show entitled True Crime Authors, both of them well worth the time. I recommend this to any fan of Scorsese and/or anyone else who helped make this. And that's that. 8/10  "
105588,tt0080678,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,"A hard movie to watch, but a truly great one as well","I haven't read or heard anything about the story of Joseph Carey Merrick, aka John Merrick, aka The Elephant Man before seeing this movie, so I can't say if it's accurate or not. However, from everything I've heard, it seems to be as close to the original story as it can get. I hadn't seen any other films by David Lynch when I sat down to watch this, so I was quite excited to see if it really lived up to all the hype surrounding it. It does. The film is excellent and nearly perfect. However, there are small imperfections that pull it just below a perfect rating, but it's very close. The plot is very good, and the way we learn of The Elephant Man is great. The way Lynch builds up suspense for the first few minutes, luring us with the promise of seeing something bizarre. When that promise is not kept, we are only more interested in seeing this, this creature that they speak of. But Lynch drags this even further... in fact, we don't get a good look at The Elephant Man for the first half hour... and even then, it's just in a flash. From there, we slowly see more and more of him, but somehow we never manage to truly get used to him. This is brilliant directing from one of the best directors out there, because obviously he would lose effect should we ever actually get used to his looks. The acting is great. I don't think I found one single character to be poorly performed. However, those that stand out the most are definitely Anthony Hopkins and John Hurt. Hopkins is great as the doctor who is amazed at this new phenomenon and is instantly intrigued in the physique of this man. Hurt is astounding as John Merrick, The Elephant Man. He brings such an innocence and purity to his character that we can't help but feel sorry for this man, as he is treated horribly by the majority of those he meet or who see him. I didn't cry during this film, but it was more close than I thought possible. For a film that deals with such a delicate subject, it has no actual sap or sentimentality... only sadness. Pure sadness. Near the ending, there is a powerful scene that shows, in a non-preachy fashion, the point of the film; it is not his looks that make him an animal, if he ever was one... it was the reactions of other men. The ending is beautiful. No other way to put it. Simply beautiful. As for those small imperfections I mentioned... I can't quite put my finger on what it is, specifically, but it just seems like something was missing... maybe I just felt that the film was too sad, maybe it was that the few attempts at lightening the mood fell flat and seemed out of place... maybe I just wasn't prepared for this moving experience. I don't know. I am honestly not sure. But while I found this movie to be great, excellent even, I have to say that there are better films. Not far better, no... but slightly better. There are films where all of the elements come together more perfectly and create a better movie overall. This one is worth watching, though, and should be seen by anyone who feels they would benefit from it on a personal or emotional level. It's a masterpiece. I recommend this movie to anyone mature enough to understand it. Yes. There is no 'definite' group of people that will get more out of this film than any other... except those that are intelligent and mature enough to understand and appreciate it. If you are one of those, and you have not yet seen this movie, go out and get it. You won't regret it. 9/10  "
106598,tt0268978,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Extraordinary,"I have not read the book, and I had not even heard of the people it revolves around. Therefore I cannot compare the events depicted with reality, though I understand that this takes liberties, and allows itself a lot of dramatic license. I have wanted to watch this for as long as I have known it existed. When I finally got a chance to, I was delighted to find that it was every bit as amazing as I had hoped. I will not reveal a lot of the plot... and I urge you, if you do not know much about Nash or what happens in this, *please* do what you can to keep it that way until you have seen this. What I will say is that the protagonist here is a mathematical genius. The acting is simply astonishing. I would list the superb performers, but I'd wind up including everyone. They are simply flawless. Two that must not go unmentioned are Russell and Connelly, both of whom deliver a powerful and unforgettable portrayal of their respective roles. The characters are well-written and credible. This is impeccably well-written and psychologically accurate. The plot is interesting and develops marvelously throughout. I could not take my eyes off this for a single moment at any point. The pacing is spot-on. This is brilliantly directed, though I cannot specify why without spoiling it, and I intend this, as all my reviews, to be open to anyone. If you are not certain what I am referring to after a viewing, feel free to contact me and I will tell you. The music is excellent and fitting. This has incredible production values, and deserves every award it won. There is some rather disturbing content, a little violence and occasional, moderately strong language. The 2-Disc Award Edition DVD comes with 2 interesting and funny commentary tracks(one with Howard, the other with Goldsman), 27 minutes of deleted(at times incomplete) scenes with optional thoughts by Ron, various informational featurettes(four of which have pages here on the site, and I will review them separately), footage of the receiving of prizes, a theatrical trailer and a commercial for the soundtrack. I recommend this to anyone who can handle what I've just described as being in this film, and who is mature enough to appreciate it. 8/10  "
108513,tt0434409,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that?,"I was fortunate enough to watch this on the opening night. Having returned from the cinema, just a few hours after it ended, and with the movie still fresh in my mind, I write this review. My main interest in the film was and remains that the graphic novel upon which it is based was written by Alan Moore, arguably one of the best comic writers and without a shadow of doubt one of my favorites. Allow me to address the fellow fans for a moment; a lot of the story is intact(if the conflict is shifted, with measurable loss of effect, to the current political climate, rather than Moore's original, anarchy versus government), though some is changed around to being more visual(even though it does have images, the original comic book is still that... a book. Words can convey more depth than moving visuals with few exceptions, and the transition from one medium to another, it is pointless to deny, requires some changes). However, several images are recreated to the very last detail(something I haven't seen the likes of which since Sin City, which used the comic as storyboards, something I suspect may have also been the case here, at least to a certain extent. I recognized so much. Some subplots and such are cut for length and pacing, but they did fair in keeping all that they could without it being difficult to keep track of for new viewers(I watched it with three people who had never seen a single frame of the comic, and each of them 'got it', and enjoyed it, just as I... one asked where he could get the comic itself). And I'm very happy to tell you that the famous torture sequence hasn't been removed; if my memory of the comic serves me right... is hasn't even been trimmed. The first trailer told me this, and ever since I saw it, I've been eagerly anticipating its premiere, and I don't regret hyping myself up for watching it in the least. Albeit, that trailer(and the following one, even more-so) also claimed that the film was action-packed... something one of my fellow viewers accepted as true, and expected. He didn't leave disappointed, though, merely surprised. Know, dear potential viewer and reader of this review, that this is not an 'action' film/flick... don't go to see this expecting constant fight scenes. If you watched The Matrix and all you saw were the fight scenes... don't watch this. There's considerably less action. What there is, however, is rather remarkable... it's clear that these are the people behind aforementioned film, and it's clear that they read and dig the comic, and comics in general. The visuals are breathtaking. I don't remember when I was last gripped by a film like I was by this one. The direction is quite good, although there are points where you can tell that the man in the chair has not sat there before, as well as the fact that he had strong guidance from the Wachowski brothers. The plot is excellent. The pacing is near perfect. The acting was flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and interesting. The film is very involving and intense, it pulls you in and doesn't let go until the credits roll. It's very stylish and cool. The film relies greatly on dialog(which also means that most of the humor is verbal, British... marvelous choice, if I do say so myself), much like the novel... although some things are obviously more visual than the source material. The Voice of London gets a face and V's fights get easier on the eyes(and obviously, the explosions are very much there). What I really enjoyed, while watching this movie, was that it was hardly toned down... it was almost all there. The perverseness, the 'different' human beings, and, most importantly, the message. The moral. The question that is asked, that we must consider: Is terror ever a justifiable tactic to use? And if so... what does it take for it to become that? I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who is willing to open their minds to the themes within(though the book contains more), and especially fans of Alan Moore, the Wachowskies and/or comic books. 9/10  "
112091,tt0077416,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,7,Not impressed,"I didn't know much about this going into it, other than that two people whose opinions I hold in high regard had described it to me as pro-US propaganda. Having seen it, I agree with them. To my knowledge, there is no historical record of Russian Roulette occurring during the Vietnam war. I understand that the people behind this argue that ""well, no one knows for sure"". Is it that hard to admit ""we made it up for cinematic effect""? That's allowed, you know; you're not making a documentary. But if that's what they're going with, allow me to counter: We *do* know that American troops engaged in atrocities including massacres. I'm not saying that their behaviour came out of nowhere(which is not to say that it can be excused under any circumstances, at most it can be explained). However, if you're going to make something up that puts the other side in a negative light, you ought to also show some of the unflattering truth about yourself. I won't claim that this is poorly done from a technical standpoint, or that the performances are bad. That is all I can say of good things about this. It is an abusively long and boring piece that at no point captured my interest. I wasn't missing explosions, a clear-cut hero or a moral; merely for stuff to get me to find it worth the time(and yes, I do love several 3 hour pictures). Someone to care about(other than Streep). Early on, I could barely tell anyone apart; they're all drunk and behaving like morons. I couldn't like any of them in the least. These obnoxious characters have sudden, instant changes of heart at apparently random times. The pacing is uneven with jolting cuts. This is shot entirely on location(no sets), and the sound-side is great. It ""feels"" real. I gotta say, between this, Year of the Dragon and *Desperate Hours*, I've about given up on Cimino. There is plenty of strong language(also a little in the informational and subtitled commentary by the director and a film critic), a bit of bloody violence and brief male nudity in this. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD comes with aforementioned audio track, three interviews(that I will review on their individual pages here on the site) and a 7 minute photo gallery, coming to 57 minutes total, as it says on the cover. I recommend this to... I honestly don't know. Evidently, a lot of people love this, and hey, maybe I just don't see what they do in it. Personally, I'd go for Platoon or Full Metal Jacket instead of this. I can't determine who this movie is for. 7/10  "
112882,tt0117951,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?,"I have not read the novel, though I might consider it. This is one of the best British films made, as well as one of the best about drug use. It is not for everyone; if you can't watch a movie that depicts addiction if it doesn't only show the negatives(and, let's be honest, most of those ridiculously exaggerate them) of it without screaming ""this glorifies the use of *insert name of narcotic here*!"", you are not in the target audience. Guess what? That approach doesn't work, it doesn't deter, lying in order to scare kids away from things you don't want them messing with costs you credibility and does not, in fact, always prevent them from pursuing whatever you were trying to get them to steer clear of. I would also like to point out that this is rather unapologetically disgusting, and you'll want to not eat for a while before or after your viewing. And if you're still interested in this after those two pieces of information, then I would suggest you give this a chance. It's engaging from start to finish; frankly, I could not take my eyes off it. Even if you've never seen a junkie, you can get into this. It gives you an unforgettable peek at the environment. The characters are well-developed, credible and fully fleshed out. While you may not like them, you can't keep from having a reaction to them; you can't tell yourself ""there's no one like that in the real world"". There is marvelous social commentary and satire in this. This is hilarious, the humor is immensely sharp and well-delivered, almost no joke or gag falls flat, and it does not try too hard. The music is magnificent. Boyle directs this in a stylish(*not* to be confused with ""flashy"") and experimental manner, and every moment of it is treated to excellent camera-work and editing, leading to numerous unique sequences. There is a lot of strong language, a little sex, brief nudity, quite a bit of disturbing content and some violence in this. The DVD comes with a couple of interviews, well worth the time.

This has been referenced and spoofed countless times, a sure sign that it has simply become part of popular culture. Everybody knows this, and it sure is difficult to argue with its greatness or its massive influence on movie-making. This film has an epic scope, and is a fantastic, sweeping love story. The pacing is spot-on, and while this has a running time of around three hours and forty minutes, it is never boring. It is simply so engaging and interesting. All roles are well-cast, and the acting is flawless. Leigh is impeccable, as is Gable, and frankly, everyone else. The characters are well-written, marvelously developed and their actions and, where applicable, growth, ring true as being entirely credible. Dialog has utterly golden, unforgettable and quotable lines, and is always delivered to perfection. The music is a grand, instrumental score.

114009,tt0116282,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"Good, but not sure if I would call it great","I haven't seen too many of the Coen brothers' films, in fact, the only ones I've seen apart from this one are Intolerable Cruelty and The Man Who Wasn't There. This one didn't hold my attention like The Man Who Wasn't There and it didn't make me laugh as often as Intolerable Cruelty. It was quite funny at some points, no doubt about that, and often it was far more funny than most other comedies... but too many of the jokes seemed to be repeated over and over. The pregnant lady eating, the locals saying 'yah', William H. Macy's character stuttering or throwing a fit... I don't know, it seemed like the Coen's couldn't think of enough good jokes, so they just repeated those they had over and over. Some of the jokes are insanely funny, though. Most of these come from Steve Buscemi. Just about every scene he's in, he steals the show. When he's not on screen, you're usually somewhat bored. One thing I also found myself getting a bit annoyed over the things left unresolved, and the scenes that seemed pointless. There were several characters in the film that could easily have been written out with no change to the overall product, apart from making it move faster. The plot is good, original and full of clever twists. The pacing is somewhat good, but too much of the film is boring. Like I said, Buscemi saves every scene he's in, but it's often boring in scenes not involving him. The acting is good, for the most part. Frances McDormand gives a great performance. The rest of the leads are all credible. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is good, and at times great. A pretty good Coen brothers' film that could have been better. Too slow-moving and repetitive for my tastes, but definitely worth a watch, especially for fans of Steve Buscemi. I recommend it to fans of the Coen's, Steve Buscemi and the other principal actors. 8/10  "
114243,tt0032976,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"Fantastic Hitchcock, one of his best"," This is Hitchcock at his best; just when you think that you've figured everything out, you are treated to a twist that completely turns your perception of the film around. This isn't the twists of modern movies, where you're immediately awe-struck by the sheer unlikeliness of them, but rather twists that send a chill down your spine and turn the movie in a direction you wouldn't have imagined possible. There is almost more suspense and tension in the entire last *half hour* than there is in the collective amount of supposedly suspenseful films of newer time. This is thriller, as it's supposed to be. Don't give us the husband-suddenly-turned-psychotic out to kill his wife, keep the face-less killer devoid of any real motive away, and please spare us the old clich«∏ of the psychopath who rarely ever has a reason for his/her behavior. This is what a thriller is supposed to be like. Constantly hinting at something, hidden in the past, keep us guessing what it is, and just when we think we've figured everything out, pull the carpet out from under our feet. The one complaint I could come up with for this film is that the first half doesn't accomplish much, apart from build-up and character development, but, the more I think about it, the more I realize that that's what makes the impact of the second half; we *think* we know these people, these secretive and hidden people, we think we've figured out what they're hiding, why they are so secretive, and then we hear how different the truth is from what we had expected, and it is devastating, in a good way. To use a metaphor: Just the moment you're sure you've put together the puzzle, someone points out that you've missed a fourth of it, or, rather, points out that the picture is, while it seems logical at its current state, far from the real picture. The plot is excellent, and the way it slowly unravels is perfect. It keeps you guessing and watching, patiently and attentive, and once you're treated to the mind-blowing final half hour, full of twists, tension and suspense, you will not feel that you have wasted the time up to that point; quite the opposite, actually. The film has a very good pace, and is thoroughly interesting. The acting is great; Laurence Olivier as the mystical yet charming Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the nameless heroine who is humble and submissive, George Sanders as the sleazy, creepy Jack Favell and Judith Anderson as the cold character of Mrs. Danver, who is seemingly devoid of emotion. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography is defining of Hitchcock, with plenty of play on shadows and long, lingering pans that only increase the chill down your spine. The dialog is well-written and surprisingly sharp. The whole thing is just amazing as a film. Defining of Hitchcock and worth watching for any competent film viewer. One final note; the last few scenes involve so many twists, so much suspense and tension, that it puts just about every single other non-Hitchcock thriller to shame. I recommend it to any major fan of film in general, as most should find something enjoyable about it, any fan of Hitchcock, and big fans of the following genres: thriller, mystery, drama and romance. This certainly deserves its place on the Top 250(as I'm writing this, it's #105), and should be viewed by any major fan of films in general. 10/10   "
120620,tt0084787,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,You really think you can trust the person at your side?,"This is a serious injection of pure paranoia. If you don't get anxious and ask important questions about what exactly happens that we don't get to see, and when, during the course of this, then you, my friend, were not properly engaged, and, let's be brutally honest here, this film probably wasn't meant for you(and hey, that's no problem, nothing is for everyone). A lot of debate is possible over the answers. And that's part of why this is so enormously terrifying, and what keeps this working for the audience, even with many viewings. It's difficult to be certain. The plot is marvelous, and its progression feels natural without being predictable. The concept is well-thought out, interesting and fascinating, and the execution does not disappoint. The pacing is spot-on, there is not a misplaced moment to be found in this. When this intends to be, it is rather intense. The atmosphere is expertly crafted, and builds at the proper speed, never rushed. The tension is so thick you can practically *see* it. The gore is plentiful, and while quite frightening, it isn't the point, nor does it ever feel like it is. And whether you like them or not, ya gotta admit, they look pretty darn good for when they were made. All the special effects in this do, almost entirely on account of Rob Bottin, the newcomer who literally exhausted himself creating them. The key is the balance, how far you push the shocks, and John's got that down to a science. The humor is of the same type and close to the same amount as his usual efforts. The acting is average or above. The characters are sufficiently developed and varied. The dialog is well-delivered and well-written. The mood is helped by the brilliant composer Ennio Morricone, who applies his talent, and puts together music that fits Carpenter perfectly. If your nerves are not in tattered rags before this is over... see the beginning of this review. All of these things together... the isolation of the people and the setting, the long, claustrophobic hallways, the genuinely successful scares, the gruesome violence and the haunting, unsettling score... it creates a strong horror piece which still holds up today, and which manages to get jumps out of yours truly, after having watched it around a dozen times. The DVD holds a feature-length behind-the-scenes documentary and a commentary track with Kurt Russell and the director, who are cool to listen to together, and which is both entertaining and informative. The menus are a tad flat, and one can tell that the release was done years after this hit theaters. I recommend this movie to fans of all that were involved in making it... in particular the man who helmed it. 9/10  "
122241,tt0758758,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Engaging,"Top student Chris graduates Emory University, and promptly leaves his old life to pursue one in the wilderness of Alaska. This shows the impact this decision has on his parents and sister, as well as the journey. It doesn't tell you if he made the right choice or not, rather it leaves that up to the individual. This is based on a true story as well as a novel, and I can draw no comparisons to either(although I understand that the book has essentially the same events, if the tone is rather different). Along the way, this kid(a compelling Hirsch) meets a lot of interesting people, and albeit he tends not to spend very long around them(he's not looking for others, he's trying to get away from society), every character is memorable, credible, genuine and comes across as a complete person. The acting is all great. Standouts are Keener, Holbrook, Vaughn(no, really), Hurt and, this one might surprise you, Pre-Twilight Stewart(yes, these last years, we've forgotten that she used to exhibit talent. This is one of her best performances). He meets hippies, the lonely, the hopefuls and a few who have no sympathy for his situation. We see both sides of nature, the stunning beauty and the terrifying danger. It is gorgeously photographed all the way. The pace is good, and I wouldn't really call this excessive in length, in spite of the nearly two hour, 30 minute running time. It captures the mood of every scene and really keeps your attention. The humanity, the sheer emotion, comes so easily to this. No manipulation or melodrama. There is a bit of disturbing content, and a little bloody, gory violence(not gratuitous), nudity(full frontal of both genders) and moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of those involved in creating it. 8/10  "
123908,tt0266697,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Revenge is a dish best served cold,"Tarantino was always a huge movie buff. People complain that his pieces are unoriginal... which, if you fail to take into account what he does with the material, I suppose is a legitimate observation. But as a point of criticism? The man has not claimed that he sets out to create something in no way seen before, when he directs. Anyone who claims that their own work is in no way inspired by someone else's is a liar or in denial. This one makes no secret about where he gets his ideas. Show me a single film of his that does nothing more than remake anything recent and/or mainstream, and I shall consider changing my opinion. He makes homages. Tips of the hat to the genres and the flicks he loves the most. This one is another, and yet again, we are in for a treat. He's got us in such an effective grip, that for a lot of this, we viewers are at his mercy. And he delivers fantastic shocks and surprises. You'll never know exactly what will happen, or when or, for that matter, how. This is undoubtedly the bloodiest and the one with the strongest brutal visuals of what he's done. It has absurdity, and has definite funny moments. The choreography is excellent. All in the name of doing 'wuxia', or Chinese martial arts on the big screen of the 1970's. Not having seen one myself, I can't comment on how he does. Nonetheless, I can imagine he nailed it. He fit some Western influence into it, as well, without it ever feeling out of place. The dialog is marvelous, and the delivery spot-on. All of the writing is masterful. As a story about getting back at those who have done the greatest evil against the protagonist, this is incredible. The acting is perfect. Editing and cinematography are tight, and sharp as a Hattori Hanzo. The story-telling is smooth, with the usual non-linear time-line working impeccably well. This and Vol. 2 are quite different, and both are fantastic in their own way. In this one, the action is plentiful and awesome. The music is beyond reproach. On the DVD is a half-hour or so featurette that I will review on its specific page, five minutes of uninterrupted performance by the 5-6-7-8's, and finally, a trailer for each of the following: Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, this and its other half. I recommend this for any fan of his, Thurman's or of the craft. 10/10  "
125469,tt0469494,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,He's still got it,"Has Anderson made a single bad film? This is the third picture of his that I watch(the other two being Boogie Nights and Magnolia), and he has yet to let me down. He continues to reject commercialism and the mainstream approach, and now brings us a story set during the oil boom in California, with a clash between greed and religion. The long takes and ambiguity is still present in his work, and he certainly isn't holding back on his vision, either; at no point in this does he shy away from the ills of the period. There is a tremendous level of detail to the depiction of the drilling, the machines, etc. This is immensely realistic, and partially because of that, it can be rather unpleasant at times. The plot is interesting from start to finish, and this has good pacing. Every role is well-cast, and the acting is flawless; they all disappear into their well-written, credible and well-developed characters. If I hadn't known it was Daniel Day-Lewis, I would not have been able to tell from my viewing. The editing and cinematography are excellent. This is astonishingly well-shot. The music is mostly classical pieces, and it fits beautifully. There is some brutal violence, a bit of disturbing content, and very brief moderate to strong language in this. The DVD holds a well-done fifteen minute featurette of sorts, or, in its own words, ""pics, research, etc."". I recommend this to anyone who is not dissuaded by anything I have written in this review. 10/10  "
126798,tt0079470,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"Still funny, after 25 years"," When a film is still funny 25 years after it's made, and doesn't feel particularly aged, even a quarter of a century later, then you know that you've struck gold. The famous Monty Python crew once again take a well-known subject and make a lot of fun of it. This time, the subject is religion, or, more specifically, Christianity. Everyone who knows at least a little about Christianity, which is pretty much anyone from the western world, will probably be able to laugh at something in this movie. Unless, of course, you are very Christian yourself, in that case you will probably feel that the film is blasphemous(I don't personally think so, since it makes fun of the followers and the general stupidity of people and organizations back in 30-something A.D., rather than Jesus and his teachings). The plot is about as incoherent as the usual Monty Python team film, though it should be noted that, like Monty Python and the Holy Grail, it is an actual film, and not a series of sketches, like, for example, the Meaning of Life. It's about as paced as they usually are, most of the scenes contain a lot of jokes, and then they move on to the next scene, after about five minutes of jokes and sight gags. This is, unfortunately, the problem with their films; if you don't like the jokes, the film might seem extremely slow to you; of course, one could argue that Monty Python mainly make movies for the jokes sake, but they could do better on the pacing, for the sake of viewers who don't like all those repeated jokes. That's not to say that I don't like them, I laugh at them most of the time, heck, I laughed so hard that I almost got stomach ache from it at one particular instant. But, I guess that a lot of people won't like them for this way of making movies. Oh well. You can't please everyone. The humor is great, it's standard Python wacky, crazy humor, so every Python fan should enjoy it. People who don't like Monty Python should give this a chance too, if they have at least a little humor, and they aren't Christian extremists. Christian ""believers"" can probably laugh at it too, like I said, it's not the religion itself, it's more the brainwashed followers that the film makes fun of. All in all, a great film for fans of the Python crew, and people who have a sense of humor about religion(a dark sense of humor, that is). I recommend it to fans of Monty Python, people who enjoy dark humor and people who can laugh a little at the less intelligent parts of Christianity. I fall into all three categories, and I loved it. 8/10  "
127455,tt0074896,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Masterful,"One can only hope that this, and its actual message, is not hated in the shadow of today's terrorism. I knew the story going in, and would say that this is a quite accurate depiction of the events. It is a perfect choice to not depict the prophet. This film is incredibly well-done. The plot is well-written. This has stunning imagery, and breathtaking scenery. The acting consists only of top-notch performances. Characters are credible and interesting. The dialog is immensely well-done. This presents and communicates its points rather well. The score is marvelously composed, epic, sweeping, and in the style of Middle Eastern music. This has great cinematography and editing. The war scenes are well-done. This entire production is very effective. The pacing is good. Coming in at not much short of three full hours, it doesn't overstay its welcome, or dwell unnecessarily. The DVD holds a theatrical trailer and a 44-minute making of featurette. There is no language, sexuality goes no further than a few costumes, and the violence is neither strong nor gratuitous. This has disturbing content, and should not be viewed by children or others who may not be able to handle it. I recommend this to everyone else. 10/10  "
127646,tt0395169,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,A disturbing and unsettling piece of truth and cinema,"Ten years after the atrocities and genocide in Rwanda, Africa, a movie is made about the man who helped lessen the loss. The man who gave everything he had in order to save complete strangers. Who put his life on the line for his fellow human beings. I couldn't possibly put to words how hard it was for me to hold back the tears for almost all of this movie(which I had to, due to the crowd I saw it with). Some of these tears weren't ones of sadness... they were at the beauty inherent in this person. This humanitarian. With everything to lose and nothing to gain, he selflessly helped people who had nothing to offer him in return. This movie reminded me of Schindler's List. However, as one of the other viewers pointed out to me, it's far easier to distance yourself from that... with all possible respect to any and all victims of it, World War 2 ended over 60 years ago. What this movie depicts is just over a decade ago. Genocide. Which took place while us in the West sat far away, comfortable and not affected by it... and we did nothing. No UN, no US forces, nothing. This film is incredibly touching. I can't see anyone watching and not being emotionally involved. The plot is well-written and intriguing. The pace is perfect. It never moved too slow or too fast. It started adequately slow, but moved intensely later on. The acting is all spot-on. The writing is excellent. A great film that everyone should see. I recommend this to everyone who can sit through. Watch it if you get the chance and you're hardened enough to take it. 10/10  "
128179,tt0091763,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Unpleasant but necessary,"War movies are very different. Usually, these differences depend on the film-makers' experience with war or knowledge of it. Occasionally, the time it was made and society's view towards it has its say in the matter too. This film was made by Oliver Stone, so naturally it's based on his experiences in the Vietnam war. Personally, I don't think there is a better war movie than All Quiet on the Western Front from 1979, simply because it's beautiful, concise and effective without simply showing lots of stuff blowing up or killing off characters we can relate to. Despite that, this film is still worth watching, simply due to how well-directed and intense it is. The plot is quite good, and follows a single platoon through a period in '67, during the Vietnam war. The pacing is good, though I felt that the film started somewhat slow only to later kick up to a very fast pace for a while. There didn't seem to be enough character development. I never picked up on all the names. Maybe there are too many major characters. That's something I often find in Stone's films, making them quite hard to sit through, and requiring more than one viewing to take it all in(which shouldn't be necessary... he's not Kubrick, after all). The acting is great. The casting is great, not one character seems miscast. The special effects are great. The characters are credible, interesting and well-written. The direction and editing is talented and effective. The film has a few memorable scenes, and the dialog contains a good bit of quotable lines. Not much else to say about the film... it's quite graphic and very direct, so you should only watch it if you're completely certain that you can take it. Oh, and John C. McGinley is excellent in the film. I recommend this to any fan of anyone involved in the making of the film, Oliver Stone in particular and fans of war movies. 8/10  "
129230,tt1130884,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Gripping throughout,"I knew I had to watch this the moment I saw the trailer, I went in with high expectations, and this still blew me away. Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Gangs of New York... OK, not Cape Fear, but that was a mistake from day one(it didn't need a remake), the talent involved notwithstanding... I've loved everything(with the one aforementioned exception) that I've seen by Martin Scorsese, and this, while it might at first appear excessively mainstream, is another example. This is beautifully shot and edited, and the lighting is just astonishing. The look is amazing. This also has outstanding FX, though they are clearly not the focus, only a tool to tell the story, which is rather brilliantly put together. In general this is immensely well-written; the dialog is clever and there are numerous memorable lines, the script is smart and every character is credible, well-developed and psychologically accurate. The acting is flawless. Levine gets an unforgettable speech that he delivers impeccably, Lynch does his ""there's something funny about that guy..."" thing perfectly, and the entire principal cast are spot-on. The score is grand and really helps set the tone and the mood, if it is arguably over-dramatic in a place or two. This is quite creepy, terrifying and exciting. There is plenty of bloody, at times gory, violence and disturbing content, relatively infrequent strong language, brief nudity and a sexual description. I recommend this to any fan of the director and thrillers that mess with your head. 10/10  "
130143,tt0033870,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,How did I kill him? I forget,"I haven't read the novel, but I hear that it is even better than this, so it must be excellent(also, I understand that this is a close adaptation, and the only one at the time). This is one of those films that you hear you must take in at least once, so I was ecstatic to find this on sale. While I admit to overall liking The Big Sleep more than this(on account of Bacall, the romance and the relationship between her and Bogie... other than those three, they are amazing in all the same ways), this had me gripped throughout. I *love* noir, and this is one of the best of them, and required viewing for any fan of the genre. The femme fatales, and in general strong women, the funny, clever, sharp and swiftly delivered dialog, the editing and cinematography(the angles, the early pan onto the floor to reveal what it says on the window as the sunlight renders it readable there, and how incredibly *smooth* it all is) and the plot. There are a few holes in the story; however, this moves so fast, and you have to pay close attention to follow it all(and it won't hurt to treat yourself to additional exposures), that you barely realize this until afterwards, and it doesn't take away from the enjoyment at all. With deception at every turn, Sam Spade attempts to locate the legendary Maltese Falcon, with law officials convinced that he's involved with the death of two men. Humphrey is charming as always, Astor is compelling(you can sense that there's something to her role beyond the first impression she makes), Greenstreet is amiable(to an extent!), and this is Lorre at his sleaziest(without ceasing to be amusing). Elisha Cook Jr. is spot-on; I could go on. The mystery is engaging, and this is tense and suspenseful. There is disturbing content in this. The 2-Disc Special Edition DVD comes with an informative and researched commentary by the male lead's biographer Eric Lax, the documentaries Becoming Attractions and One Magnificent Bird(I will comment on them on their own sections here on IMDb), an authentic theater-going experience(when this movie was shown originally, there would be shorts, animated and live-action, before the feature presentation), meaning, The Gay Parisian, Breakdowns of 1941, Hiawatha's Rabbit Hunt, Meet John Doughboy(all of which I will review on their individual pages here on the site), and finally, a trailer for this and one for Sgt. York, a minute and a half of newsreel footage, and one minute of make-up tests. I recommend this to anyone who likes this type of picture. 10/10  "
133544,tt0052618,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Masterful,"I did not know the full story before watching this, and have not read the novel upon which it is based. This is also the only version I have seen. I almost don't see any reason to pursue any other adaptation of the tale, because I can't imagine it being done more skillfully than it is here. While this is clearly a film for and about Christianity, it is not a requirement to believe, or for your faith to be directed towards that particular religion, to enjoy and appreciate it. The themes and moral are broad enough, and I think anyone can get quite a lot out of a viewing, or several. At no less than three and a half hours, this is well-paced, and is rather exciting when it intends to be. The famous and often referenced chariot race scene is impeccably well-done, intense and convincing. Heston nails the role, and the acting is in general spot-on. Dialog is excellently written and perfectly delivered, with good points that you can apply elsewhere. The plot is interesting and engaging, and develops nicely throughout. This has an epic scope, with massive sets, countless extras and a grand score. The production values leave absolutely nothing to be desired. There is strong and brutal violence in this, as well as disturbing content. I recommend this to any and all fans of the medium of cinema. 10/10  "
138197,tt0075686,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Incredible,"This is the first film by Allen I've ever watched, and it definitely will not be the last. The writing is extremely sharp. With the help of a couple of old and already famous analogous jokes, Woody makes several impeccable points that hold up today. In fact, in the most important areas, this could have been made today, not over three decades ago. The pieces of truth and commentary are compelling, and the delivery of them is spot-on. Editing and cinematography are good. This is marvelously directed. The long takes are impressive, and the form doesn't draw too much attention to itself. Breaking the fourth wall is used to great effect. The acting is excellent. This is perfectly paced, and this shark does not die. Nothing is excessive or out of place. The humor is utterly hilarious. This is about forty-ish TV funny-man Alvy Singer, and more specifically, his love-life. The characters are interesting and well-developed. Every line of dialog is pure gold, and flawlessly delivered. Language is mild, with a few references to sex. There is drug content in this. I recommend this to everyone, as long as they have a reasonable base of the knowledge required to understand the references and such, and are not turned off by the neurotic lead. 10/10  "
138766,tt0120382,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Meaningful,"It's been about a decade since this film came out, and the sad truth is, the majority of people haven't learned. Reality TV is not dead, but has rather flourished, and is gradually becoming more and more perverse(indeed making the idea presented here seem almost tame by comparison, which is a very unpleasant notion to consider), digging deeper into the lowest common denominator to grab attention(worse still, it's working), and they are at least as shallow as they've always been, quite possibly worse(I won't claim that I watch them), and costing depth in real people, by abandoning it in favor of more ratings-grabbing ""entertainment"". Niccol is not a man who favors superficiality, or that which seems, at first glance, to be perfect, beautiful, or even right... nor is he one who keeps quiet about his view on said subject. One needs to look no further than two other movies he wrote, Gattaca and S1m0ne, both of which he also directed(he is perhaps less shrill in his protesting in the former and this, compared to S1m0ne). I've not watched much of Weir's work... to this day, only this and Dead Poets Society, which my review will immediately reveal, I did not find to be anything special. Therefore, I don't know whose idea it actually was to let the imaginary hidden cameras be our eye into the world of Truman... whether Niccol had it in the script, or Weir thought it fitting... but I commend and respect whomever thought of it. The score and music are fitting. The acting is good, all-round... Carrey surprises. Harris is marvelous. Carrey may have some sillier moments in this, but it is a film separate from his comedy work. Those seeking his typical brand of humor(which it should be noted, I am somewhat fond of) won't find that satisfied herein. Exposition is delivered with fairly good subtlety. The writing in general is excellent... Niccol hits the mark entirely, and maintains a realistic tone, steering carefully clear of the pitfall of mockery to the point of the ludicrous, which he would later fall into with S1m0ne, and his continued exploration of reality is interesting. I personally make it a point to keep up with what the man is working on. The satire and cleverness found in his work deserves recognition. This, as The Cable Guy, has some social commentary on the viewers, but on the whole, this is by far the superior film(sorry, Ben). It is but saddening that it would seem that the film caused exactly what it may have been trying to prevent. I recommend this to fans of science fiction, Andrew Niccol and Jim Carrey as a dramatic actor. 8/10  "
139461,tt0083987,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,Beautiful film,"I knew little of the man whose name graces the title of this film before I watched it... I knew the name and had a vague idea of what he stood for, but that was it. Through this extensive three-hour biography, I was told what appears to be almost all of it. Gandhi was an extraordinary man. His philosophy of not fighting physically, but simply resisting, to let the oppressors of his people come to realize by themselves that they were on the wrong(while it arguably would not have worked many other places or even at other points in time) was truly genius. A peaceful revolution, a non-violent overthrowing of government... it sounds as if those sentences contradict themselves, but through this man's work, they were proved to be true. The plot is interesting, and takes off from the very beginning. The pacing varies, but is mostly good. The acting is all very strong... Kingsley *became* Gandhi. The characters are well-written, though there certainly are many of them... you'll need to pay close attention and concentrate to be able to remember all of them. The cinematography and editing is of high quality, though it's often kept relatively simple. The dialog is expertly written... when Gandhi speaks, whether simply stating his philosophies and claiming the rights of his people, or using his clever wit to expose the ignorance and unfairness of his oppressors, it's perfect. You can not argue with this man's intentions, and the effectiveness of his methods is widely renowned. Yes, he may have been stubborn, perhaps even too much for his own good... but his fight, his victory changed the world, and his example will remain an inspiration for years to come. I recommend this film to any fan of the people involved in making it and anyone interested in Gandhi. 8/10  "
139953,tt0440963,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Smoothly bookending the trilogy,"I haven't read any of the novels, though I know enough to be able to assure you, these movies are different from them. This is pretty much adrenaline in celluloid form. From the first to the last frame, this is incredibly exciting and intense. The action gets a definite upgrade, bigger and also better than before. This manages to put a fresh spin on stuff we've seen before in the new franchise, and it works impeccably well. The choreography and execution of the fights, shoot-outs and car-chases are excellent, with no exceptions. I don't know exactly what it is, but the hand-held camera is simply nowhere near as distracting and unpleasant as it was in Supremacy, in fact, it's great. Maybe they improved, or perhaps one adjusts to it during that film, and is then ready for it in this one before it even started. We are again treated to exotic locations around the world, and they are gorgeous, sights to behold. Tangiers is unforgettable in several ways. The stunts are astounding. This has a marvelous plot that ties the three stories together, and develops well throughout. The pacing is spot-on, in spite of being unbelievably fast, it allows you sufficient time to catch your breath, so the audience is not overwhelmed. There is genuine suspense in this. This can actually be watched without having seen the other two, and without it seeming full of redundant recaps. Exposition is perfectly handled. The acting is strong, every single performance. New additions to the cast are well-chosen. Characters are well-written and fleshed out. The emotion and impact are very good, if Identity is possibly a little superior in that area. This is easier to follow than the second one, and more complex than the original, 2002 one. The score is yet again fantastic. On the DVD are 12 minutes of deleted and extended scenes sans explanation, five featurettes, four of which I will review on their entries here on the site, and an insightful and informative Director's Commentary. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it, and/or the series. 10/10  "
140748,tt0075148,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,One of Stallone's best films," Let me start this review of by making one thing absolutely clear; I hate boxing. I don't even consider it a sport. I consider it legalized violence, that people pay money to see, knowing that each blow to the head costs countless braincells. So, there is no way I would ever like a boxing movie. But Rocky isn't a boxing movie. It's not about boxing; it's about determination, will-power, and doing what you can to realize your dream. That's why I think Rocky is a great movie; it has something that everyone can relate to. Many people who watch this movie don't know the first thing about boxing, nor do they care about it(myself included); but everybody has a dream, something that they want to accomplish, something great they want to achieve at some point in their life. And that's why it's going to appeal to so many different people; everyone can relate to the theme: wanting to realize a dream. The plot is good, it moves along at a slow, steady pace, so you will need to be fairly patient with this film. Don't worry, the waiting pays off in the end. That I can promise you. The acting is pretty good, by pretty much everyone in the film, even Stallone, who I'm normally not at all impressed by. The characters are well-written, credible and likable(the ones we're supposed to like, at least). The story and theme is something that really sparks some interesting thought, especially since this was based on something that really happened. It's definitely one of Stallone's best films. I recommend it to fans of Stallone, and people who the subject appeals to(which should be many, many people) who has the patience to sit through a somewhat slow-moving two-hour movie(which narrows it down a little). 8/10  "

Also included are genuine effort to get into it, thought applied to putting it all together, and obviously sufficient attention span. Reading the FAQ and visiting the site for it, and working through the puzzles found there, also help. I don't mean to scare people away from this, more to inform. This is like a jigsaw puzzle, and not a simple one at that. When the pieces do all come together... well, I imagine that it's satisfying, I honestly can't claim it's happened for me yet. But I really can't find anything in this to criticize. The plot is interesting, and develops throughout. The pacing is deliberate, nothing is rushed or dwelled upon in a manner it shouldn't be. The acting is flawless. The philosophy and food for thought are well-done. Editing and cinematography are excellent. They're experimental(that, in fact, is a word that really applies to this entire film) without being flashy or over-stylized. The music is amazing and always well-chosen. The production never shows that its budget was little by today's standards. The effects are astounding in every case. Kelly definitely deserves his work being noticed. The overall concept is well-thought out, and while this is certainly not the first depiction of it, even on the silver screen, it is the most ""realistic"" and consistent one, and it's near the top of the list as far as how engaging it is(The Butterfly Effect does, for me, beat this in that respect, but I will admit that the writers of that did do stuff that was more cool than it was sensible, if not very often). I understand that the Director's Cut is the version that largely explains what happens, whereas the Theatrical(which is the only I've seen thus far), to a wider degree leaves it up to individual interpretation. There is a bit of disturbing content, and there is some language, as well as dialog that should perhaps not reach younger ears. In any event, this is hardly meant for children. I recommend this to fans of Richard Kelly, the others involved in making it, and dark science fiction that you, when or if you watch, must be an active participant of. 10/10  "
142828,tt0056801,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Wow,"This is the first Fellini piece I watch, and it most definitely will not be the last. A lot of people call this boring. Let me make two things clear right off the bat: This is *not* fast-paced, and it is also not for everyone. There are a lot of characters, and it is not easy to immediately distinguish between ""reality"" and fantasy in what we are presented with on the screen. Also, this is a piece of meta-fiction; Frederico, whilst suffering from writer's block, made a picture about a director attempting to, yes, put together a movie, while experiencing that very same condition. Not knowing much about the artist's personality and life, I can't tell how closely this depicts either, but given that there is at least a resemblance, this is, in effect, a film that the man behind it put some of himself directly into, and its subject is, indeed, that very same thing. The cinematography and editing are excellent. Every acting performance is spot-on. The surrealism is impeccable, and marvelously implemented. This has undoubtedly inspired countless people who work in the medium. I understand that this gets better(some say increasingly) with successive viewings, and that anyone should at the very least give it a second one. For now, I take their word for that. I certainly intend to delve further into this. The DVD comes with a trailer and a feature entitled L'ultimate sequenza, or The Lost Ending, which I will review on its individual page.

144037,tt0088247,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,9,"Excellent, holds up unbelievably well","There are a lot of marvelous reasons to love this. What exactly they are may vary, but I can give you my suggestions for a couple: It mixes a bleak, dystopian future vision with breathtaking, mind-blowing action(and without becoming a film that can't inspire you to think, and that goes for others done by the man who helmed this), and does so extremely well. It is blessed with the enthusiastic and perfectionistic direction of James Cameron, and it shows. The pacing is utterly impeccable. I could not tell you how many times I've watched this. The plot and science fiction are both fantastic, well-thought out, and hold up to thorough scrutiny, I've yet to find a genuine problem in them. The concept is terrifying, smart and thrilling. It all unfolds rather well. The script in general is spectacularly well-done. This never runs out of steam, and in spite of intensity, it doesn't overwhelm, either. All three of the listed genres are masterfully achieved here, and I would agree with anyone suggesting that ""horror"" should be mentioned, as well. The acting is magnificent, the performances are spot-on. Not sure I'd say that there are any exceptions to that. I became a fan of Biehn from viewing this. Schwarzenegger does pretty darn amazing. Henriksen is a lot of fun to watch, intentionally so. Lines are well-written and equally well-delivered. The score is synthesized and is a perfect fit. The music, clothes and special effects(which are almost invariably still incredible) are the only aspects of this that date it any. The guns are tremendously well chosen and handled(read the Trivia to see Arnie's efforts in that area). There is violence and some relatively disturbing sights in this, as well as a little sexuality/nudity, and a moderate amount of language, that can get strong. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the notion of an exciting movie with gun-fights, car-chases, a dark tone, well-done sci-fi, that just might provide food for thought, if you go in looking for that. 9/10  "
144731,tt0107048,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,7,"Good, but hardly great","I'm not saying that this movie isn't funny... quite the contrary. But so many claim that it's great, almost a masterpiece... why? It starts out very good, with Bill Murray being his typical, sarcastic, at times deadpan self, and continue being so for a good while... but somewhere, about halfway through the movie, the films pace suddenly slows ridiculously down and we're suddenly not watching a comedy with Murray's sharp wit and excellent delivery, but rather a typical early 90's romantic comedy. Why couldn't this film break that damn barrier? Why does there always have to be romance? I know, I know, us humans have quite an insatiable lust and longing for love, but can't we think of something more original and constructive to put in movies? The film gets better a little later, with Murray doing more fun stuff again... and the plot is now turned around. The first half of the film is Murray doing what he feels like, pleasing himself, the latter half if him serving other people, pleasing others. This works well, and there are some funny moments in both parts(though there are far more in the first). But the whole romance subplot... I don't know, maybe it's because it's Andie MacDowell, the queen(well, one of them... another good example would be Julia Roberts, but she's done more versatile roles) of annoying romantic comedies. Why, oh why must there always romance in movies like this? Hell, the movie could have gotten an 8 from me, or possibly even a perfect 10, if it had kept up the great entertainment of the first half. Some of the movie also seems to drag a bit, since we're basically just watching the same thing over and over again... but with tiny alterations every once in a while. The plot is good, but the romance subplot sucks. The pacing is OK. The acting is somewhat good... but the only actor that impressed me was Bill Murray... and even he was portraying the exact same character that he always does. The characters are well-written... to a extent. The humor is good. All in all, the movie is worth watching and good, but it's by no means great. I recommend it to fans of Bill Murray and *shudder* romantic comedies. 7/10  "
144862,tt0114746,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,Is it true?,"La Jet«∏e, the short that inspired this, is somewhat different, if there are a lot of similarities, and one could argue this as partially a feature remake. There is a long list of reasons why this is a masterpiece of cinema. Allow me to go over a couple: The time-travel makes sense, and the logic of it holds up here more than that of quite a few other films. It's surreal(and yet credible, and not so loose that it's difficult to follow) in the way we would expect from Gilliam, though the focus is considerably clearer. The ambiguity lasts from beginning to end, and you are not limited to one interpretation of what actually happens, and, just as important, what does not, in the course of this. You won't feel confident that you know what's going to happen next in this, with the one devastating exception, which is a mortal sin to spoil for anyone who hasn't taken this in on their own. Heck, it's got two star names of Hollywood, both playing against type and delivering performances that are beyond reproach. In general, the acting is impeccable. Stowe is very natural. The plot and concept is excellent, and the development throughout, the gradual uncovering that so skillfully appears to supply the audience with additional pieces of the puzzle, when it is in actuality also forcing us to ask the question, ""does the board even exist?"". You have to pay close attention to ""get"" everything, and viewing it only once may not suffice. With that said, this is satisfying and you come out of it having been told a full story. The pacing is spot-on, this doesn't really stand still at any time, yet you are allowed time to relax in-between the intense sequences, and are not overwhelmed to the point of being drained. This is immensely engaging and involving. You will be served quite a lot of food for thought, and you will find yourself emotionally affected. This is an amazing piece of film-making craft, technically speaking, as well; the lighting, cinematography and editing are astounding. The special effects are marvelous. Every character is well-written, you believe that people like these could exist. There is strong language, disturbing content and bloody violence in this. The Collector's Edition DVD comes with a 90-minute documentary that I will review on its individual page on the site, a theatrical trailer, production notes and a commentary track of Terry, the director, himself, and producer Charles Roven, and it is entertaining and informative. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a challenging piece where you won't always know exactly what's going on, and fans of intelligent science fiction. 10/10  "
146135,tt0073195,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,A classic for a reason,"I base this review upon the 2-Disc Special Edition DVD release. We all know the theme and the famous lines. This is part of popular culture, with countless references to it and parodies of it in the almost 35 years that has passed. I suppose I will still describe the plot: A small island community finds itself terrorized by a shark. A really, really big one. The storytelling is good, and this never loses your attention. It's interesting to note that the limitations of the mechanical effect led to this being as excellent as it is. Not being able to show the animal all the time, Spielberg opted for build-up and character development, thus creating a marvelous suspenseful atmosphere as well as getting the audience properly invested in these characters. This is immensely exciting and intense, and you don't know exactly when something is going to happen. The acting is great, every single performance(with the possible exception of some of the kids, but that's nothing new). FX are better than you might expect, and the careful and precise editing and cinematography succeed in making them entirely convincing. The score is solid. This comes with an featurette that is almost two(in total, all of the stuff amounts to maybe three) hours long and worth watching, an interview with Spielberg, deleted scenes, Shark Facts, a minute and a half of unfunny outtakes and some galleries. There is frequent moderate to strong language, a little bloody violence and disturbing content. I recommend this to any fan of horror films and/or thrillers. 10/10  "
146737,tt0072684,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,"A tale of love, war and power","While this is, in my opinion, not the best of Kubrick's films, it is in no way a bad film of his... some have claimed it is overlong and dull, but I don't think so. From what I've heard, it does the novel justice, and I believe that is what Kubrick went after, more than anything else. That is admirable, for a man who throughout his career was known for making unfaithful film adaptations of famous and popular novels, much to the dismay of the authors. The film perfectly presents everything from the time period in which it takes place... something that few, if any, other films have accomplished. It deals with the life of Redmond Barry, his ups and downs. The first half has us feeling sympathy with him, and shows his rise to a high position and gain the name Barry Lyndon, and everything that entitles. The second seems to turn us a little more against him, as he goes through the expected downfall that must always follow an unexpected rise to high life. Through the film he gets desensitized and careless. We follow him through most of his life, and an uneventful one it is not. As all other Kubrick films, the visual side is probably the most prominent one of the film, as he grants us several long looks at the beautiful sets and locales, and there are more than a few of his trademark shots slowly zooming out from the focus point to display the surroundings. The plot is great, and almost constantly developing. It is narrated with a good sense of irony and clever social satire on the time period. There's plenty of humor in the film to make the three hour run-time seem less long. The pacing is good and thorough without the film being slow(though I do admit that it isn't a film for those who are not used to long, visual films). The characters are well-written and credible. The acting is excellent all the way. Not even the child-actors seemed less than perfectly convincing. The costumes and sets are great. From what I understand, there is no detail in the film that is even slightly historically inaccurate. That is quite impressive for a film that takes place about a century and a half before it was made. I have heard of great deals of work done to keep many films accurate, but I don't believe one exists that manages to do so with such perfection as this. Even the very language that they speak is accurate. The special effects in the film also deserve mention here... for a film that is almost thirty years old, it's impeccable how believable and convincing the effects are... I couldn't tell how most of them were done. Kubrick was indeed one of the most brilliant directors ever... he was not only a master at his craft, he was also one of the most innovative and inspiring film-makers to have ever lived. I recommend this great piece of cinema to anyone who has an interest in the time period the film is set and any fan of Stanley Kubrick. Don't miss this one. Not his greatest, but a truly great one nonetheless. 10/10  "
147529,tt0264464,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,A very interesting and entertaining film...," This is an interesting story, watching a con artist evolve, how he starts off with the small stuff(in an early scene, he pretends that he's a substitute teacher, to get back at another student)to stealing enormous amounts of money(several million dollars).

147728,tt0044079,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"One of the Hitchcock greats, but not his best","I was lucky enough for this film to come on TCM, so I had the opportunity to see it. It's rather hard to find, despite it being a Hitchcock classic. Unfortunately, it also has its shortcomings, some of which Hitchcock has repeated later. First off, the ending is a little too neat and ""perfect"". In the last few scenes, until the last five minutes, there is an astounding amount of tension; then, the five minutes just clears everything perfectly up... very unsatisfying. The ending is also overly dramatic, for a Hitchcock film. He is, was and always will be the master of suspense... why would he stoop to something as low as a cheap action sequence for the ending? Apart from the few shortcomings, the film is great. The plot is excellent; one of the best and most universal ever. The theme? Simple. You meet a stranger. A perfect stranger. He offers to kill someone for you... you know you have someone you want(if nothing else, subconsciously) dead. The catch? He asks you to do the same for him... will you accept this bizarre yet ingenious arrangement? You're clear of suspicion, and so is he... after all, neither of you knew the victim. And you don't know each other, either... you're just 'strangers on a train'. Brilliant concept, and one that just about every single person can relate to. The pacing is good, you never lose interest or patience. The cinematography is good, but not nearly as good as it is in other, better Hitchcock films. The acting is flawless. The characters are well-written, credible and realistic. Hitchcock uses some of the same elements that he often uses; the dominating mother, the mothers boy, etc. The film is very good, but it just feels a little watered down. It didn't go that famous extra mile that would have made it great. It stopped before crossing the line between what's common and what's daring. That is the primary reason for the film failing to be great, but mainly remains good, with potential to be more than that. The end leaves you unsatisfied and disappointed. However, everything leading up to the end is very good, so the film still gets a deserving 8/10. Good, but not great. Any fan of Hitchcock should see it, as it is among his best... somewhat far down on the list, but still there. I recommend it to any fan of Hitchcock. 8/10  "
147814,tt0401792,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,10,One word? Rocks,"I read the three full books from where the stories for this were taken before I first saw this at the cinema. I was thrilled beyond words by it then, and it still has that effect on me. This is probably best classified as noir(and my how they hit the nail on the head in how they do such a genre piece) with a shot of adrenaline. It is also the way to do a direct adaptation. Characters perfectly brought to life by a cast laced with star actors, all of whom hand in amazing performances. The tone fits that of the original material. And last, but not least, perhaps even most important: it is copied pretty much straight from the source. Frank was present during production and with Robert they put almost all of the comics on the screen. With the former's strong writing and the latter's knack for energetic direction, it's a recipe for success, and they do not let us down. The plot evolves nicely throughout, and is interesting for the entire running time. The pacing is spot-on, never letting you get bored, nor overwhelming you, in spite of the amount of cool stuff. The action, plain and simple, is awesome. There's a ton of it, and it's all well-achieved. The cinematography and editing are masterful. The humor, much of which is quite black, is great. Rodriguez throws in some of his cartoon-like bits, and they work. The score and music is all magnificent. The script is immensely well-written, and the lines are so memorable and quotable it's not even funny. There are some mighty violent and disturbing images herein, and unless you're certain you can take it, you may want to consider sitting this one out. There is also a good deal of nudity and sexuality, albeit it has been cut down considerably from the pages. There is rather little language, and what there is tends to be relatively mild. It doesn't feel restrained, in my opinion. You have to admire the guts and integrity it took to make this... anti-heroes and darkness aren't always received kindly by the masses. Among the DVD releases for this, there is the Special 2-Disc Edition... if you want my advice, I'd say to get that, if you're buying a copy of this. There are several featurettes, two audio commentary tracks(one with Miller, where Willis also briefly dips in, and one with Quentin Tarantino, and RR is on both), another audio track which is of an audience reaction(and they're all listen-worthy), and the extended cut adds some(although it isn't many minutes) of what was cut from the Theatrical(do also note that it splits the segments back up into separate ones), in addition to featuring that version, as well. The FAQ goes into more detail about exactly what is found of extras, as well as what footage remains missing. I recommend this to any fan of the graphic novels, Frank Miller and/or Robert Rodriguez. 10/10  "
150950,tt0325980,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,3,Just bad," When I sat down to watch this movie, I was expecting to see a movie that was decent at best. I was very surprised to find how unbelievably bad it was. The plot is non-sensical jibberish. The characters are all one-dimensional, either good-to-the-heart, or bad-to-the-bone, with absolutely no variations. The acting is horrendous, Johnny Depp is like a washed-up rock-star, heavily drugged and very drunk, the entire time. Orlando Bloom is nothing but a simple rehash of the knight in shining armor, if only a bit more easily tolerated. Keira Knightley is just a damsel in distress, pure and simple, nothing else. Something I found ridiculous, was that every other character, even minor characters, mastered sword fighting. The humor is unbelievably childish, at several times it was on the level of the newer Simpsons episodes, which made me cringe more than I believed was possible. All of the CGI effects were very bland, most looked like they could easily have been made at the same mediocre quality several years ago. Why so many people claim this is a great film eludes me. If you ever even consider to sit down and watch this, make sure you keep your expectations very low. Very overrated. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, as it is simply too long, too boring, too bland and too cringe-worthy to be the least bit enjoyable. 3/10  "

He fears his romantic partner Vanessa(Baccarin, sexy, charming) won't want him anymore, and tries to find Ajax(Skrein, easy to hate...in the right way), who was in charge, and who claims he can reverse the effects. A straightforward revenge story, complete with a love interest, leaves this just mainstream enough to satisfy the studio heads, and lets writers Reese and Wernick, as they did with Zombieland, play around with every single other genre trope, subverting our expectations and delivering an enjoyable ride to those just coming in as well as those all too familiar with the comic adaptation. The cool, swift action isn't big enough to compete with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, it's the first movie in the X-Men franchise to refuse to add several detailed abilities(leaving it rather bland, with both sides just being ""incredibly strong""), and it is very much an origin flick. While there's no teleportation, we do get dual Desert Eagles and Katanas, and there's acrobatics all over the place. And this does justice to the non-stop barrage of pop culture references and irreverence of the Merc with the Mouth. The fourth wall breaks are kept sparse enough to have the most impact. There is a lot of strong language, a moderate amount of brutal bloody disturbing violence, and a little nudity in this. I recommend this to anyone who has a dark, twisted sense of humor. 8/10  "

This takes off right away(you won't know exactly what's going on from the start... and it doesn't answer every question, or maybe it's how little I know about Eastern culture), and keeps to a quite fast pace, making the two hours fly by. It's got an epic scope, and the adventure is exciting, with several chases. Atmosphere is built effectively, and what happens has an impact. The designs are creative and imaginative, there are unforgettable details, and the animation is fantastic. This is very silly and the humor is over the top. The DVD comes with alternative angle storyboards for the whole thing, 11 minutes of Studio Ghibli trailers, 5 minutes of the opening and ending sans text, 4 minutes of trailers and 2 and a half minutes of artwork.

155599,tt0058461,abgkasjlkasjla,denmark,8,"The first part of the famous Dollars Trilogy, and one of the best Westerns"," Sergio Leone made some of the best and most well-made Westerns in his career, and this one is no exception. It's the first part of his Dollars trilogy, and, in my opinion, superior to the second part, For a Few Dollars More. I can't say if I prefer it to the third part, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, since it's been too long since I saw that, but I'll re-watch and review that one soon, and then I'll clarify my position on each of the films in the trilogy. The film is widely known as the first spaghetti-Western; that isn't true, as far as I know. It's not the first spaghetti-Western, it's just the first that became internationally known. Not to say that that isn't an accomplishment for Leone too, though; after the films release, everyone wanted to make spaghetti-Westerns. The plot is great; it deals with The Man With No Name who arrives in a small town, finds out that it's run by two major families, and decides to make money by turning them against each other. It's not terribly fast-paced, but it's more interesting than the second movie, and less dragging than the third. The action is also great; it might be slightly inferior to that of the third film, but only slightly. The score, and especially the theme, is inferior to that of the third film, but that's not to say that the theme or score of this film isn't good; it's just not as good as the theme/score of the third film. The acting is good, and in some scenes, great. I didn't find all of the performances great, though, but none were entirely terrible. The characters were all credible and well-written, despite the fact that a few of them are(or has since become) Western cliches. All in all, a great spaghetti-Western, and a must-see for any fan of Clint Eastwood and/or Sergio Leone. I recommend it to fans of spaghetti-Westerns, Sergio Leone and/or Clint Eastwood. 8/10  "

Everyone has something to bring to it, in action, drama, humor, etc. This is a stand-alone that takes place in the same universe as the Avengers films, and you can go into this with no knowledge of those, or the comics it emulates and is based on. This takes inspiration from Star Wars and Indiana Jones, and lives up to the standards set by those classics.

He escapes with the aforementioned seemingly limitless source of energy, and with the threat of it being used to allow an invasion of Earth by the alien force the Chitari, what can Fury do other than... Assemble Avengers. This is an excellent piece, that lives up to the hype. It will satisfy comic readers and more casual viewers of this franchise alike. A lot of people will be exclaiming that, so I will try to back it up instead of just fawning over this(and believe me, I could go 1000 words just doing that). It follows up on all... no, *all*... of the threads set up in the five films that came before(and yes, it will really help to have watched all of them before this... then again, if you have any interest in this, you probably already have). Nothing is abandoned or ignored. The sheer planning that went into this... and this is still full of fantastic surprises. And for all the development(all of that in this is highly credible, by the way) of characters, powers and conflicts(and this takes the ball and runs with it, and adds the interpersonal relationships of these people who have not shared a screen before now, who are rather different people) that precedes this, there is a solid amount of it in this, as well. All six(and no, you can't tell that two of them, one of them especially, haven't gotten much screen time before this) members of the faction are treated to an astonishing introduction(actually, that goes for Nick and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier, both very cool, as well), a strong heroic act that only they could have accomplished, *and*... a situation of immense peril(not to mention that they(and we) are treated to one continuous tracking shot that showcases all of them taking names using their talent, one by one, once they've grown into a team, working together... no, they don't start out like that, and yes, there is indeed infighting early on, and yes, we get every one-on-one that anyone wants, and it is glorious... the trailer is literally just the preview). All of them have something to do(and they are recruited gradually, no one overshadowing anyone else... and somehow, this gets all the aspects that make them work individually, in their own movies, somehow, without getting tonal schizophrenia), some reason to be in this, and the threat(Hiddleston is friggin' intimidating) is grand enough that we need all of them, and for them to band together. Tony has to prove that he is selfless, that he doesn't just fix his own mistakes(and he brings his mainstay of taking what can barely even be called calculated risks, that come out to putting a severe dent in the enemies). Steve has to adjust to a world and time completely foreign to him, and bring them all into one, effective unit(and he is the great leader that is required, one that you yourself would follow, and, indeed, a Super Soldier(a title he earns)). Thor(who brings godlike might, and a Shakespearian sibling rivalry with the bad guy) and Natasha(who is the real brains of the operation, and can manipulate the foe... they use one of her qualities well, that being her apparently complete detachment from emotion leading to an uncertainty of what she does feel and what not) are dealing with a lot of guilt, on account of it being an Asgardian causing trouble for the planet and her... dark past as a spy who'd take on missions for or against anyone, respectively. Clint(who brings his specialized arrows and extreme accuracy to good use) has his own to make amends for(you'll see...). Bruce(who comes with the sheer destructive weight of his alter ego) is brought on for his expertise on the subject of Gamma radiation(he can help find the vital cube), and... I don't need to spell out what he feels bad about, do I? He does seem to have gotten the Hulk under control... or has he? This builds up the transformation, and he remains a danger. He's the only one to have another person attached to it than played it last, and while I had no problem with Norton(who I love in other stuff... in that, he didn't do all he could with it, though), this part is Ruffalo's. There is this very terrifying aspect to him, he could metamorphose and cause significant damage and pain... and he plays it like you'd expect him to be, very non-confrontational and anxious, yet smart and confident in his field. All of them risk their lives and limb for the good of mankind, saving countless people. There are not many supporting roles(Phil Coulson does return, and he is enjoyable, with a fandom of Cap; there's also a female agent named Hill, who kicks ass... in fact, every woman in this is hot, independent and not objectified... kudos for that, along with the rest, Whedon), with focus placed where it should be, on the ensemble cast. Is it necessary for me to devote space to let you know that the acting is spot-on? You've already seen Chris, Robert and Liam do incredible, and they do so here, too. Everyone does. The writing is phenomenal. I am struggling to find one line of dialog(with Iron Man-like wit and banter) that isn't quotable, sharp and well-delivered. The action is plentiful, has distinct stages to it(none of that unaimed, mindless crap), culminating in a truly massive climax, and somehow never running out of steam or exhausting the audience. This keeps to a pitch perfect pace, and at nearly two and a half hours, there is nothing tedious or rushed. The FX? Breathtaking. 3D? Used right(only little distinctly moves towards/points at you).

Belle is beautiful and could have anyone in her village for a husband, but she loves books, doesn't want to settle down, and wants adventure(...yeah, she does come off slightly ingrateful for the quite nice life she has for herself, anyway, she's interesting). Meanwhile, Gaston, the best and most handsome hunter around wants to marry her, which she isn't open to. The main theme explored here is, of course, that one should look underneath and not judge superficially. And as such, aforementioned Zapp Branigan type would be the hero in any other Disney piece. He isn't even really the villain right away. He doesn't look like a monster, his behavior makes him one. And the opposite is true(at least in time), of Beast(albeit his manners and temper need work), who is treated to a magnificent design, that allows him to be terrifying as well as express insecurity. That goes for his voice, as well, which is pitch perfect(literally). The underlying softness to it is fantastic. This keeps to a great pace, the plot is moving, characters are developed, things are never standing still(and humor is injected all over, without it costing(much) dramatic effect... whether you find it funny is like with much else from this studio, and for family films, a lot of it is for, or at least meant to also work for, kids). It's genuinely exciting and you want to know what happens next. The moral lesson is present without it being preachy, and it comes across rather well. Roles are all well-cast. This is a musical, and the songs can be pretty catchy. The dialog is good. This is animated well and with passion and energy. There aren't a lot of negatives. I would argue that LeFou doesn't look like he belongs, he's too cartoony among all these realistic-looking humans. There are the usual points about fairie tales and the conventions belonging to the genre. As an example, the romance is out of necessity, first and foremost(the magic has to be reversed, and within a set amount of time), as relationships tended to be back when this was originally conceived(hundreds of years ago, not the development of this interpretation). I personally can't help notice the disturbing(and not the only thing in this that is, either) nature of all the living furniture. If you drink from the living mugs, are you kissing the people they used to be? What if a plate is dropped on the floor, does that kill the person it is? And in the sequences where there are hints of hundreds of items that are alive, do they just sit around doing absolutely nothing when not being eaten out of or the like? Does the bottom cup in the pile get a bad back from the weight of the others? These are questions that shouldn't be asked, of course(and then one can choose to apply psychology, and wonder if this is a case of Stockholm Syndrome). I think a bigger issue is the timeline... from what happens in the small town, it comes off as this all happening over two, maybe three days. Is that really long enough for all that takes place in the fortress? Still, these are not big enough problems to take away from this being a remarkable piece, that hasn't aged a day in 20 years. The Diamond Edition 2-Disc DVD set comes with an amusing and informational commentary(with directors, composer, producer), a Sing-Along track, the well-done, tightly edited and compelling(somehow, the special features garner far more laughs than the flick itself∂?) documentaries Beyond Beauty(51 minutes, it goes into the people who created this), The Story Behind The Story(26 minutes, and since it has its own page here on the site, I will be reviewing it there), Composing A Classic(19 and a half minutes), ""animation""(13 and a half minutes), Broadway Beginnings(12 and a half minutes), deleted scenes(27 minutes, the first two thirds of which completely change the approach and render it darker), deleted song(7 minutes, and 1 and a half minutes intro), alternate version: ""be our guest""(5 minutes), 2 music videos(3 and a half minutes and 4 and a half minutes), early presentation reel(3 minutes), 4 TV spots(2 minutes), camera move test(2 minutes), alternate score: the transformation(2 minutes), games(Simon, and a personality test), Trailers(Tangled, Toy Story 3, A Christmas Carol, Hannah Montana Forever, Bambi, two for this(4 and a half minutes total, with intro by Don Hahn)) and a promo for BluRay.

4857,tt0068646,Abhay Dighe,united kingdom,10,Watch it? It's an offer you can't refuse!,"So much praise has been attributed already to Coppola's multi-layered masterwork it's difficult to add to anything not already said. It's enduring appeal over the years (it's incredible how it hasn't feel at all dated) must be the result of Coppola's mix of excellent ensemble acting by all concerned - a multi-layered complex story reflecting not only dispelling the myths of how the mafia was perceived in post WW2 America, but also edicts of family, loyalty, devotion and the difficulty of controlling or maintaining any position of power, as well as some brilliant set pieces, character acting & one-liners that have become part of film history folklore. This saga & story span many years but is entirely engaging throughout.   Ultimately though, it has to be seen as the prototype great American saga family soap opera, and the one by which all others are judged. Much has been stated about Brando' performance -ultimately it's the restraint he shows in exposing the frailty of an ageing Mafia Don losing his grip on power and struggling to effectively raise his family and keep his favourite son out of a life of crime. Pacino is brilliant at conveying the transformation of innocent son struggling to keep the family business at arm's length, to the painful realisation for his family to survive he too must compromise to become the type of character he loathes yet is extremely effective at- both ruthless & uncompromising.  Beautifully shot by Gordon Willis, and brilliantly acted by a cast that quite rightly all went on to become some of America's greatest actors of their generation. Every viewer I have spoken to is engaged and enchanted by the characters;both strenghths & foibles- Don Corleone is a man of great power, epitomising the dark & light sides of the American dream, but for the most part he uses it mercifully. we feel for this family's pain when they suffer loss despite their sins, & root for their merciless triumph.  A great American masterwork, and one of the greatest films of all time. "
140519,tt0075148,abhay168,india,10,Gonna fly now.....fly high now...........,"Once you've watched rocky your life will never be the same.i can tell you by personal experience that my life changed completely. Rocky is more than just a boxing movie. Rocky is about going after your dreams when the opportunity arises. Everyone can relate to being the underdog, to being the down and out guy without a chance of actually being the one to come out on top. Rocky Balboa uses boxing as a metaphor to just capitalize on the great opportunities that come by in life. One of my favorite scenes that I feel makes Rocky so special is the night before the fight. Rocky wonders around the stadium, and then goes back home to Adrian to say ""he can't beat him."" This is a moment where Rocky sort of admits defeat; it's a gripping, captivating scene that displays the more gritty realism of Rocky. Everyone from time to time has those moments of doubt, where they realize that it just ain't realistic and feasible. This shows the depth and character of Rocky, almost as if he has sort of been broken down. At this time, Rocky just decides that ""All he wants to do is go the distance. Nobodies ever gone the distance with Creed, and if the bell rings and I'm still standing... maybe I'll realize I wasn't just another bum for the neighborhood."" This scene is so pivotal in marking a fairy-tale movie like Rocky so much more gritty and realistic. Rocky is just such a magical, emotional, powerful film. You feel like your in it with Rocky, and during the fight scene your standing up screaming for Rocky. It's such an incredible experience. It's sentimentalism at its best. The acting is terrific all across the board. Burgess Meredith is perfect as Rocky's trainer. Talia Shire is great as the love interest. And ......... Sylvester Stallone was born to play the down and out, lovable boxer. an Epic movie not to be missed....  "
66544,tt1345836,abhdie4,india,10,The perfect ending to a fabulous trilogy!!!,"The Dark knight Rises, was in some ways, the perfect ending to a great trilogy. This $250,000,000 action filled creation of Nolan is a perfect testimony of his sheer genius and imagination. The only possible reason it cannot be termed as ground breaking is because the grounds were already broken in 2008 by ""The Dark knight"". This movie was as spell bounding as its predecessor. Massive in its scope and breath-taking in its conception, the Dark Knight Rises explores the character of Bruce Wayne a.k.a The Batman in the backdrop of a now peaceful Gotham. It is set 7 years after the death of Harvey Dent. Bruce Wayne is shown as a man who is broken, both physically and spiritually by the antics of the Joker. Christopher Nolan with his portrayal of the masked crusader has done a superb job of showing us the anguish and struggles Batman was going through. On one hand Bruce was still broken by the death of Rachel and on the other his Gotham city was threatened by Bane (Tom Hardy). Apart from challenges Batman had to face ,Bruce Wayne also had to bear the brunt of a bad investment in a clean energy project. Subsequent events led him to bankruptcy. The movie is about these challenges Bruce faces and how he has to find a balance in life and rise from the darkness that surrounded him. The Portrayal of Bane was done superbly by Tom Hardy, as an insane mercenary whose only aim was destruction of Gotham. There is also a connection between Bane and Bruce which is later revealed in the movie. The ever faithful Alfred (Michael Caine) and Mr Fox (Morgan Freeman) who always had Bruce's back do so again. Their prime task was to put forth the difficult questions which Bruce had to answer, questions pertaining to his past and future. And the cat women played by Anne Hathway was a character who had her own set of moral values, but at the end of the day she plays an equally important part in the future of Gotham city. In the most elemental sense The Dark Knight Rises is about the fight between good and evil. What is amazing is the execution of the movie and the flawless way Nolan explores the character of Batman. And a word of praise should be given for the music which gives the viewer a rush of adrenaline during some unforgettable scenes. Shot in 5 difference countries this multimillion masterpiece is undoubtedly the crown jewel of Nolan's Batman Trilogy.  "
26208,tt1375666,Abhi Kadam,india,8,Logical notion given a complete reversal,"Practical / logical notion given a complete reversal to accommodate inventive storytelling and Hollywood megabucks special effects. Works wonderfully to the fully immersed viewer but leaves the popcorn crowd clueless about what's happening on the screen other than the mind boggling innovative visuals that keep on popping throughout the narrative. A review I read somewhere said it is AVATAR for smart people. While the basic concept has been exploited to death over the last decade; starting with the first MATRIX in 1999, people living in a dream world where anything is possible (hence the scope for heavy duty CGI hogging significant amount of movie runtime) the uniqueness that sets INCEPTION apart from the rest is the brain behind the project ∂? Christopher Nolan. Nolan has always made the fantastical premise work in a practical set up. Like most of his movies, except Batman Begins, the plot has to be deciphered as you go along .. therefore for serious movie lovers the movies have to be seen more than once to completely comprehend the story and characters. He almost always has lateral / simultaneous ""tracks"" as per the non∂? linear style that has been in vogue over the last two decades of cinema (1990-2010). For all the inventive brilliance of the project, the ""explanations"" sometimes get a bit overbearing, but that is an unavoidable pitfall, rather a necessary evil for a movie like this because of the sheer scale and complexity of the plot. Inception is based on two main branches of a single concept: Mind manipulation/control - (1) Extraction ∂? removing/stealing an idea/thought/memory from a subject's sub- conscious while he is asleep and dreaming, which is considered ""easy""; and (2) Inception ∂? planting an idea/concept in a mind to manipulate the subject to accomplish your goal through his mind, which is very difficult, albeit impossible. In the reality of everyday non movie life this entire line of thought is flipped. The romance between Dom Cobb (Leo Decap) and Mal (Marion Cotillard) is bordering on obsession and psychotic behavior all through the movie. The love is pure but so is the chaos and madness. The lines between being in love and then being so much in love that it hurts yourself and the one you love are completely blurred. The man-woman relationship explored in a sci-fi pseudo intellectual set-up is unique for sure∂? but a bit too over the top for its own good. Like ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Inception's"" final forty minutes shoot forward with the authority of a freight train, powered by the conviction of its own greatness. The dream within dreams plot line is taut and convincing if you are immersed in the film completely ∂?otherwise just sit back and enjoy a visual feast !!  "
111566,tt0118715,Abhi Now,india,2,A retarded tale by a retarded duo,"My close pal persuaded me nuts to watch this movie. The fact that I agreed to his persuasion shows that I learned nothing from my experience from O'Brother Where Art Thou and 'No Country for Old Men'; the fact that I was persuaded to see this movie is the reason why i am still eagerly looking for this close pal with a poison dripping machete in the hand( Hope he doesn't read this review till we meet again). It's said everything in the life has a reason behind it. Of course those who say it haven't seen The Big Lebowski or they would have furiously denied ever having said such rot. Apparently Cohen brothers don't believe in making a movie with a reason behind it, or within it. What's more apparent is that they also don't believe in making movies with any storyline, plot devise, characterization or a rudimentary sense of storytelling. So in this respect The Big Lebowski can be held as one of their crowning achievements. There is nothing much to say except that even your best of pals are not to be trusted these days- the guy I spoke about in the first line just called me and hearing that I have forgiven him for his sin, he has agreed to come over for a drink.

142296,tt1201607,Abhi Now,india,4,It could had been much much better,"Time for your OWL marks Mr. Yates and Kloves! No- don't bite your fingers; You don't get a Troll nor a Dreadful either- you have just managed yourself a resounding Poor though. Hmmm, better luck next time!- not for you but for HP fans who may want to see someone else re-doing the entire series in future. Death Hallows Pt 2, for some time to come, will remain as the foremost example of a movie that could had been a classic if not for the grand opportunity missed, or rather wasted by the director and the crew. It had every resource at command- a very talented set of actors, latest 3D and computer technologies, and a 10 years old legacy to guide its way to greatness. But quite inexplicably it refused to even say 'accio' to these sources, and instead, after running impressively through half the way to summit, it wandered, stumbled, and then jumped off the path into same abyss where Harry is made to throw the Elder wand at end. The movie starts convincingly from part 1, and holds itself really well until the time the trio of H.R.H enters into Hogwarts. The scene in vault where artifacts start to multiply or the flight of dragon are superlatively done, there is no question to it. But once inside the castle, the fizz suddenly goes off the movie. Yates wanted to rush towards boom boom explosions with such haste that it let the thing implode on itself. And so the second half becomes a rubble of montages and frozen frames crashed in a monumental heap where Harry Potter fans like me are still trying to find some meaningful pieces together. To put it another words, the entire second half of the movie is just arranged together- there is no feeling introduced, no association built with the characters, no bridges created (but blown away certainly). It just compilation of images one after another. Pretty, no doubt, but Mr. Yates, ought to know that in wizarding world people in images also have soul; and the second half had not a shred of soul in it. And therefore, I did not feel any personal sense of loss when Hogwarts shook and crumbled, when Fred, Lupin , Tonks and so many others died, and quidditch ground burned to ashes. Damn you David Yates- I had loved Hogwarts more than my own school, had ROFLed at Fred's quips and jeers, followed wizard quidditch more than Ron, and had made friends with Harry's batchmates. You dehumanized the entire saga, and left me with not even a feeling of mourning at these losses and worse-- neither one of jubilation at Harry's triumph. And this is my principle discontent. In the movie, the climatic fight between Harry and Voldi occurs completely isolated and away from everyone. There is no one to watch watch this epic struggle which was building since last 7 years of the movie chronology. It was absurd and spoiled the movie for me. I had never liked the 7th book much, but still the conversation between Voledomort and Harry at the end was thrilling and enthralling ∂? equally moving was Harry's conversation with Dumbledore's portrait. Yate's machination constructed an altogether different and vastly inferior ending. As a foot-note, this is still a tolerable movie- and certainly not 'OMG-worst-movie-i-ever-saw' kind of stuff. Pity is that, it could had been much much much better.  "

Space itself is mysterious and interesting and same goes with this movie. Movie will keep you engaged till the end. Now the bad part. There is too much unnecessary emotions in film. Most of the time it will irritate you and makes you think why characters are behaving in certain way. For example, world is ending, we have no choice, your dad is willing to save it, why would you get angry and keep saying, ""Stay, don't go"". what other option do we have. Anne Hathaway; big wave is coming, Mathhew is saying, ""Please come on ship now"", no i want to find recorder. What would you do with recorder if you are dead. And then there is fight on another planet. Overall characters shows immature human emotions which conflicts with technology and science part of the movie. I am sure Nolan wanted to make this movie for everyone hence the emotions. But people who know wormholes, black holes, theory of relativity will never care about this. Overall a good flick :)  "

But the one who tell a fairy tale is truly an Angel.","Pan's Labyrinth (2006) Directed by Guillermo del Toro, It seems like he himself has a strong belief in Fairy tales, and the same belief he expresses as a filmmaker on the screen. But in a way others also can not ignore the existence of fairy tales. 3 Oscar winner Pan's Labyrinth is considered one of the highest rated films in the world because of it's illusionary realism. The Film is based on 1944 fascist Spain, plotted between the struggle of Spanish Army facing the guerrilla attacks by the revolutionaries and a young girl who is fascinated with the the twist and turns of the fairy tales and finally she witness it in reality. The story gradually develops carrying the plot of fairy tale and reality. From narrative, to performance and from performance to the visual effects everything is as convincing as daily life reality. Like Albert Einstein said ""If you want your children to be intelligent tell them fairy tales, If you want them to be more intelligent tell them more fairy tales. Do we ever think what is life made of ? This is a question most of us don't have answer or may be we all have various opinions about it. But if one has been a student of literature, History and Science can understand it in a convincing manner. That everything has appeared from the imagination, Imagination is womb which gives the birth to the future. All the scientific Invention we see in modern life, It was mentioned long before in a piece of literature. Firstly some body like ""Jules Verne"" Imagined it, and one of those who believed in it turned it into reality. In summarize way our growth is limited to our imagination and our expansion could be as infinite as our imagination. The Universe is considered infinite, and so is the imagination and may be one of the universal truth is that whatever we can imagine exist. If we imagine evil, evil exist, if we imagine angels, Angels exist too. But there is another aspect to it, ""Belief"" Belief is nourishment of the imagination, the more we believe in what we imagine, more effortlessly and soonly it manifest. The world we live in now is the result of our conscious thinking and belief. And we are on the edge of time when our thinking and belief is limited to scientific theories. In the concretized version of the modern world it's rare to witness magic & Miracles. And it seems like an uncommon phenomenon, and these days people rarely believe in it except the children and some psychics. But it still exist, Yesterday I was reading a news on India TODAY which mentioned ""How a woman who was about to be raped by a pervert, saved miraculously when a cobra snake appeared out of no where on the sight. People may call it just a co-incidence and deny the magic of it, But you believe or not it is still a miracle. And All of us have witness similar moments once or more than once in our life times. Most of us perceive life in two aspects Negative and Positive, No body wants to experience the negative while everybody wants to grab the positive. In reality negative or evil or demonic experience are the skeleton view of positive and Angelic and harmonious experiences. We all must take a journey through the time with belief in our heart to witness the miraculous. All the fairy tales explains it well and proves it well. because the realm of fairy tales is timeless and endless, It begins by saying ""Once upon a time..."" and ends by saying ""Happily ever after..."" or similar sentences. So that it should be always relevant and for everyone. While watching Pan's Labyrinth, I experienced extreme positivity and developed a belief in the miraculous. I think we are going through a time when Adults need to read and listen more fairy tales than the children. It can heal and cure the toxicity of human life more than the scientific medicines. If any child reading this Article, I request you to tell your Parents, Uncles or elders a fairy tell before they go to sleep. The one who writes a fairy tale can change thousands of lives, And the one who make a movie on it can change millions of lives. But the one who tell a fairy tale is truly an Angel. So, tell somebody a fairly tale today. And now I will go for the dinner by mentioning the following lines from Pan's Labyrinth ""And it is said that the Princess returned to her father's kingdom. That she reigned there with justice and a kind heart for centuries. she was loved by her people. And she left behind small traces of her time on Earth, visible only to those who know where to look.""

Being a nature oriented cinematography, the visuals of trees, mountains, rivers, free birds are obvious but these images make powerful impact in the movie, especially when Chris looks at the mountains. Casting is good. Emily Hirsch is perfect for the role, young, full of attitude and firm on his opinion. William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Jena Malone played a good role as Chris' family. Kristen Stewart was beauty and sparkling as a young girl and even for a short duration, she added happiness in the movie. But, what took the movie to a greater level is the performance of Hal Holbrook as Ron. He just nailed it. A retired military old man, rich in experience and philosophy who connects easily with Chris and becomes a family bond. Movie is in good pace and tells us clearly how Chris' parents fought over the years, forcing Chris to live secluded. His love for books by Leo Tolstoy and Thoreau shaped his radical ideas and love for the nature and rebellious thinking. Scenes of Chris diving into the river, adventurously sailing with his kayak into the flood river, walking into the Alaskan beauty mountains, running behind horses in open field and hitting the road symbolizing the ultimate freedom are shown beautifully, making you want to live like this. What makes Into the Wild a magical experience is the Eddie Vedder's music. Songs are just class. Perfectly in harmony with the scenario of natural living and happiness, these songs take you close to Chris' living. 'Such is the way of the world', 'No ceiling' are real pleasant to hear and 'Society' is as painful as the reality of life. The movie is easily a memorable experience and in my favorite list of movies. The quotes of Chris about career, life, nature are deep and it questions are lifestyle. If you are wise, you will understand somewhere we are wrong and lost as a civilization. Hats off to Chris!  "

A movie that can be watched again and again and still it makes your heart pump. Truly a 10 star movie.Direction 10 out of 10, background score 10 out of 10, acting speechless. We rarely find a movie that has a perfect star cast and every actor outnumbers the counterpart. Morgan freeman truly legendary actor. These are the movies that not only deserve awards but also some special position in Cinemas history. Hope is the biggest weapon for any man to achieve something in life. Shawshank redemption proves these lines that Hope is the biggest thing in life. "
66983,tt1345836,abhijit-me,united states,10,Awesome Conclusion to the Legend of The Dark Knight.,"At a run time of 2 hours 44, it never gets boring and the movie is quite evenly paced as there's so much story to tell. There are a couple of important twists towards the end. Once again it proves that a powerful script is the most essential part of a great movie. Just like the previous movies, the visual effects are good, especially here the IMAX footage comprises of around half of the movie. Michael Caine's performance as Alfred is perhaps one of the the best performances in this movie. Just like Batman Begins, Christian Bale has a bigger role in the continuation of Bruce Wayne's story, which was mostly missed out in The Dark Knight. Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character as an idealistic cop John Blake, has one of the important roles in the movie. Surprisingly, they have altered the voice of Bane to make it sound a little more more legible than it sounded in the prologue that was premiered last December. Sadly, Cillian Murphy's character Scarecrow needed a bigger role than the 3 minutes he has. Bane's ending could have been a lot better which is the only low point of the movie. Scarecrow in Batman Begins was there to induce fear, Joker in The Dark Knight was there to create chaos, and Bane is here to inflict pain. This movie focuses on shades of post 9/11 world, where a powerful terrorist (Bane) feared by everyone, holds a whole city captive ensuring any outside help impossible. There are some shades of anti-occupy Wall Street movement too, where Bane's henchmen literally attack Wall Street savagely beating the rich, dragging them out and promising the good people of Gotham to claim what is rightfully theirs. There are few sequences in homage to Batman Begins (including the signature line 'Why do we fall...') and story does come round a full circle around Ra's Al Ghul and League of Shadows. Well, it couldn't have had a better ending than this to conclude the legend of the Dark Knight. A city, where people begin to stand and fight for their own without fear. A city that doesn't need to depend on Batman anymore...  "

Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top ""prison"" movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well! The film touches upon many subjects, including the ideas of hope, redemption, love, loneliness, justice, life/death, friendship, endurance, fear, patience, inspiration and so much more. Watching this movie always makes me feel a million times better, and if that's not the greatest reason to watch a film, I don't know what is. Give it up to both Freeman and Robbins for completely engulfing their characters with heart, soul and the spirit of humanity. I appreciated the message in this film, I absolutely loved the way it ended, I surrendered to its pace, I enjoyed all of its characters, I thought it was wonderfully photographed, I loved the score and I could seriously watch this movie 10 times a year and not bat an eyelash the whole way through.

The way each character is introduced is terrific. It is story telling at its best. From Shahid Khan to Sardar Khan to Sultan, you actually end up fearing them all - the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Manoj Bajpai is amazing as Sardar (he really got into the character) and the narration (by one of the gang members) adds a lot of flavor to the entire flow of the movie. Siddiqui's role is brief in the first part and I have a feeling he will play a major role in the remaining part of this epic. He is already looking good. Tigmanshu as Ramadheer Singh is terrific, his expressions too good. Apart from this, the movie is informative - it very subtly tells the audience all about the way Indian coal mafia has progressed over the years, the gang wars, the politics. Obviously there is a lot of slang. I have not seen a Hindi movie with so crude a language ever, absolutely not recommended for family viewing and children/teenagers.  "

I was really fascinated by this simple film. The movie deals with the varying viewpoints of 12 jurors on a murder case. Only one juror feels that the accused is not guilty and he goes against the other 11 with a handful of evidences against their theories. Believe it or not, 90 percent of the film is shot in a single room. You won't find elaborate sets, skimpily clad girls or any high octane action, but what you are going to find is the stellar performance from all the 12 angry men and a very subtle yet edge of the seat thriller. It once again proves the point that the success of any film relies on the performance of the actors and more importantly a furnished screenplay. There is never any dull moment in the entire movie. If you miss this movie you have missed one of the best films ever made, period. "

People say a person dies two times in his life, once when he is really dead and once when he steps out of his childhood. So if you are given a chance to live up your childhood for some 90 minutes, this movie is for you. Mystical creatures, nature, joy and sadness conquered by happiness are the some childhood reasoning. You wont go on reason everything you see and you have a belief in everything even Santa Claus when you are a kid so why don't relive those great feelings. Speaking for the movie the movie is made with a big heart. The picturesque scenery, the great artwork, the epic storyline, even the soundtrack especially THE PATH OF WIND one of my fav's instrumental. Hayao Miyazaki has created a life out of the movie. Besides it will indulge you in your childhood nostalgia, it will also show how beautiful nature and the villages can be which are reducing at a great rate. Many say this is a movie for kids, some say it's so naive. It is if you watch this movie with your mind full of reasoning. Sometimes do follow your heart and then watch this movie and feel the workmanship the makers have put into it. Concluding movies like this are not made often. A movie for all age groups and for EVERYONE. Finally, PUT YOUR REASONING ASIDE WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE.  "
1536,tt0111161,AbhiMathews,canada,10,Welcome to Shawshank,"Going to prison is never easy and almost an unimaginable experience for most people. It's even worse if you are sentenced for fifty years despite being innocent.   Shawshank Redemption is an incredible movie. Not only because of its fantastic narration and storytelling technique. Not only because of the emotional yet inspirational performances put on by each and every actor/actress. Not even the spectacular filming and perfect settings. No, what makes Shawshank Redemption a truly excellent film is the complete story and the very relatable tale that is the life of Andy Dufresne.  This movie focuses on the lives of minor characters, life in and out of prison, and how the system has changed so many men and women drastically. And it's these individual stories that make Andy's even more special. He was able to stay strong, to manage without friends or support in the worst times. He was a man no one would have looked at twice. No one special. Just another person like you and me. Yet, his story is one that we can all imagine ourselves in. Where bad circumstances meet inexplicable motives, and it's being capable of imagining ourselves in Andy's shoes that makes Shawshank Redemption such a beautiful movie.  This movie stands for a lot of things. Love, respect, peace and friendship among other things. More so than the rest, Shawshank Redemption is a story about hope. Having faith in the future, secretly knowing good will overcome bad.  No one knows what our future holds. But if we could all live like Andy, optimistic and ever so kind in the most dire of situations, holding up true justice, this world would be a better place. "
35052,tt0114369,AbhiMathews,canada,10,A Different Story,"It is seldom that a movie with such an eerie mood can continue with a continuously building story line and characters who are so dynamic. Modernism and beliefs lie at the heart of the movie, and Se7en does an exceptional job in executing a great plot with even better acting. Most actors would not be capable of filling the roles of two detectives in such a morbid case. The stars Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt act wonderfully in their respective roles, and manage to remain in character and evolve throughout the film. Being initially introduced to the two men, both at different stages of life, viewers begin this exhausting journey which neither characters are prepared for. With superb performances, underlying themes and a carefully manipulated script, Se7en truly does succeed in encompassing the qualities every great movie should. The numerous connections to religious and social affiliations offer a different view of the world, and share the side of things most do not see. Although the acts displayed are corrupt, which is a purely subjective topic, insights into the mind of a killer offer this movie a trait most lack - perspective. The brilliantly written script, including fabrications many people would never even contemplate, puts Se7en on a new pedestal. This thought-provoking thriller is one for the ages, and is one that I highly recommend.  "
37639,tt0118799,AbhiMathews,canada,10,Foreign at its finest,"Sensitive topics such as World War 2 are generally portrayed in their classical sense, where the life of various individuals in either Concentration Camps or battlefields are exposed. Not that there is anything wrong with this, but Life is Beautiful manages to tell the tale of two lovers and their family, and how the War will never dampen their spirits. With the Jewish people being primary targets in the Holocaust, this foreign film displays how true love cannot be broken by the evilest of atrocities, despite race or religion. Happiness is rather difficult to attain, especially for prisoners who are near death, but Life is Beautiful succeeds in demonstrating that a light of hope can shine a dark room. This movie deserves as much praise and accolades than any other. With great acting, starting from the stars to support, Life is Beautiful encompasses the attributes every great movie should. The emotional plot, filled with comical satire, is a cinema any move critic would enjoy. With Italian films being known for their romance and passion, Life is Beautiful should be remembered for being able to reproduce these same qualities in a setting where tomorrow is not always certain.

In the past, I would simply turn the television on, pop a CD and watch for about two hours. This no longer happens. American History X is a truly wonderful film. It offers thought provoking discussions, an emotional plot and a story we can all learn lessons from. Over the years, watching movies as a hobby has transformed into a learning experience--one where the viewer is a student who witnesses the events transpiring. As the students, you start to see American History X is more than a single class where insolent children have catharsis; it's a place of growth where boys become men. People argue that you never really value something until you feel pain like the characters in this movie. The relationship issues, pursuit for happiness, thoughts of loneliness and anger that builds up inside are emotions we all feel. Maybe we never actually do realize the importance of others and the values we hold until a traumatic event occurs, but this movie certainly comes close.  "

Whether it's the breathtaking cinematography or the sentimental moments filled with awe, this is certainly an epoch. Earth is not sustainable∂?a poignant point clearly expressed throughout the film. With space exploration an upcoming necessity, this movie not only breaks the surface, but delves into the depths of the unknown regarding the ultimate fate of humanity and life in the Universe. Man's survival instinct is one of the strongest driving forces present today, and Interstellar certainly displays the extent of its potential. Time is of the essence, and every second counts when it could be over a year long, literally. From the initial set surrounding a barren Earth quickly crumbling to the ends of space as we know it (or don't), this movie travels through both space and time trying to find a solution. A solution unknown, but a solution nonetheless. Imagination is a skill people seldom use or trivialize more often than not. The opportunity to go above and beyond, to not fear the Universe's infinite possibilities but to rather understand it, is one of mankind's greatest achievements and ongoing goals. Interstellar presents a sharp and worthwhile outlook on the world, and how the Universe works in mysterious, unimaginable ways.  "

Unbeknownst of the thriller I was about to watch, this film offers an extremely thick but thought-provoking plot. At each step of the story, viewers try to question and seek out answers--only to be one (or several) step(s) behind. From the introduction, we follow a flamboyant character who's about to endure hardship like no other. Life is not always fair, and that statement is magnified in this tale. Imprisonment, especially without justification, is torture. Not knowing its extent is even worse. With each day no different than the last, time seemingly runs forever, and sanity is in low quantity as time progresses. Whether we agree or disagree with the antagonist's decisions is one debate (albeit one-sided), but the lesson taught by this extreme example is one that deserves reckoning. From the ""harmless"" teases to the malicious attacks, everything we do has an effect, whether minuscule or grandiose in nature. Only time will tell our fate, but be conscientious, since you never know what may happen next.  "
79368,tt0066921,AbhiMathews,canada,8,Full Circle,"Often times, films depict a character and his ardour. A Clockwork Orange has a crafty lead in Alex who is as dynamic and vibrant as any. This movie is definitely creative and provides an original theme uncommon in most modern movies. It's the gait of the delinquents, diction of the characters, structure of society and underlying themes in this movie that make it such a spectacle. A Clockwork Orange is sinister. From the initial acts of the four to the events of Alex's life, the entire film revolves around the theme of ""an eye for an eye."" Committing criminal acts, remorseless to the innocent and weak and pure disregard for the future is what life is like for the boys in the beginning. As time progresses, it is evident Alex is, by nature, looking for excitements and finds it in violence. A Clockwork Orange literally displays that people can only, to a certain extent, be changed at the core level. Despite advanced psychological treatments, a criminal who does not choose to change will not. A reason people love this film is because of the sharp contrast it has to most contemporary movies. Rarely do you see such an adventurous yet negligent person who has wits but chooses to exploit others with it. This film is definitely worth the watch since it will leave you on the edge of your seat always awaiting for Alex's next move...  "
83258,tt0086879,AbhiMathews,canada,7,An Incredible Challenge,"Perfection is a feat often sought but rarely attained (perhaps never, some say). Antonio Salieri, the man who never was Mozart, recounts his life and the great influence this peculiar man named Amadeus had on his entirety. From Salieri's outlandish dreams to royal career, Mozart's ingenuity eluded him and he could never quite figure out ""how?"" For such an eventful and studied life, Mozart certainly endured a lot despite having all the talent in the world. Skill was never a question, but showcasing and having others comprehend his beauty at the time often was. Salieri, despite his best (and vile) efforts, never approaches the perfection Mozart produced at a whim. To create perfection so easily is the great struggle that haunts him to this day. But maybe perfection is never truly the goal. This extraordinary biopic is as entertaining as they come. Whether for the great score, pleasant acting or overall story that will live forever, Amadeus is certainly a tale to tell.  "
84269,tt0062622,AbhiMathews,canada,7,Changing Times,"Venturing into space is a dream many of us earthlings have starting from our childhoods. The exhilaration of leaving our atmosphere and wandering in the deep darkness, that is our Universe, in complete silence and serenity is a vivid imagination that we all have that almost seems surreal. Yet foreseeing the proper methods and precautions of space travel with certainty is impossible, and sometimes things don't always go as planned. 2001: A Space Odyssey contains relatively short dialogue compared to today's films. A lot of the scenes involves grand imagery and the tale is being told through mute skits. When you look at the overall picture of this film, it's hard to pinpoint any exact focus or direction for this movie. The two common aims that can be deciphered is the search for discovery and a curiosity for exploration. From the apes conquering each other with weapons for the first time to an expedition to Jupiter to look for extraterrestrial life; this entire movie involves seeking for a greater purpose. A Space Odyssey is very aesthetically pleasing and far ahead of its time. Throughout the entire film, you will be in awe of the tremendous scenery and epic soundtrack accompanying the great journey you're about to witness. Kubrick certainly accomplished creating a philosophical masterpiece with 2001 and it should be watched by all who are open-minded and prepared for an adventure.  "
103842,tt0050976,AbhiMathews,canada,9,Seeking Light,"Death is an inevitable fate we will all succumb to. Learning to live life joyfully and seeking answers for the innumerable questions we have is what gives life its worth and essence. ""When"" our time ends is out of our hands but what we do with it is something we have control over. It is the dynamic idea of ""freedom of life, yet constraints of time"" that this movie explores. In this film, a knight and his squire return from a crusade. Once back, they begin questioning the purpose of life, the existence of deity and begin a long journey with Death at their footsteps. Life is rough. After visiting home after years of fighting for an unfounded cause, the knight feels desolate and detached from others and seeks for the light in life that he once had. The time at which we pass away will be when we least expect it. Throughout this movie, we see the knight playing Death in chess. He tries to gain time by cheating and evading death, but in the end, we will always lose the battle. This movie does a masterful job in demonstrating mortality and how our lifetime is to realize the significance of our placement here on Earth.  "

Although outdated and set in olden society, many of the themes are prevalent and generally forgotten in society's high tempo. We tend to go through life, completing daily tasks and essentially not living life and enjoying its facets. What is family? Just your reproductive offspring and people you speak with on occasion? What is the purpose of life? To just have fun and enjoy your time on this planet? Wild Strawberries is a commendable film since it displays the inner conflicts we all go through to seek meaning. No one really knows what their time on Earth is for. At the end of the day, will we be satisfied with all we have done and left undone? Movies generally focus on entertainment and try to provide a platform for audiences to enjoy themselves and superficially relate with characters. I truly believe the connection viewers built with Isak was a deeper one since this misunderstood elderly man is just trying to find his way in life like we all are. When we're on our deathbeds and nearing the end of our time, will we be happy with the life and legacy we are leaving behind and ready to go?  "

Surveillance can be outright blatant (e.g. with strict curfews) but can also be secretive. The futility in all of this is that the public's expressions may be silenced, and freedom abolished. Not only does this decrease our quality of life, but it leads to the population living in fear. V for Vendetta has a lot to offer. With subtle yet strong messages implicating past, current and future trends, this film reveals the truth surveillance states face. With great screenplay and plot development, this deep movie is exciting with both action and romance from start to finish. Despite its fantasy and surreal effects, there's a very strong sense of realism. The events in this film are not so different from modern day. I truly enjoyed V for Vendetta. Although there are sequences full of unrealistic elements, the overall film is enthralling and stimulates the mind. It is one that reminds us of the duty each citizen holds.

But in all seriousness, this movie revolves around the misfortune(s) of Lebowski: a lovable passive man who just wants to enjoy life, but is put in a whirlwind instead. From the bowling alleys to the bridges, going on this adventure is constant excitement and joy. You can't help but smile to see the Dude take what life has to throw at him in the best way he can. Lebowski is quite the man, and this movie's highs (literally) and lows certainly prove it is more than just another dull comedy. Watching this movie even after hearing about all its reviews, I was still quite impressed in every aspect of the film. Whether it just be scenes of playing at the lanes, or taking a relaxing drive outside, I can't overemphasize how much I enjoyed this film. I highly recommend The Big Lebowski since I'm sure it will put a smile on your face...and even give you a little something to think about.  "

This film is not about the classic blackmailing of others to get them to do you're dirty work; rather, it's a tale of a man who will go to whatever depths necessary to seek retribution. Every single scene, angle and line in this movie contributes to the ultimate plan, and it's every piece that makes Hitchcock's movies such a puzzle. Always sitting on the edge of your seats, constantly wondering what will happen next and having butterflies form in your stomach -- these are just some of the side effects you will have from watching this film. Playing detective is a role that is never easy, especially when you're against a criminal who leaves traces that lead to the wrong people. Hitchcock did a terrific job with Dial M for Murder because not only does he manage to entice the viewer for the entire 105 minutes, but he starts making us imagine what the perfect murder really would be. I think it's safe to say: vengeance and wits are never a good combination.  "

Drugs and the lifestyle of an addict are a dangerous combination. Although Renton and his mates appear free and in their own world, they are unaware of the dangers they put themselves in. Going through each day as an adventure is fun but putting your life at stake each time for such little reward is futile. This is a realization Renton slowly makes. Everyone goes through rough patches but these boys seem to hit it all. Prison, death, sickness and emotional breakdowns are just some of their problems that seem to never fade away. Not always so obvious, getting away from life isn't so easy. Over time, the boys evolve like any young men. Some proceed to stronger drugs while others try to get their act together. Regardless of their intentions, it is apparent the boys' pasts always catch up with them. All they can do is try and lead the lives they want; no one should expect anything more.  "

What I didn't expect was the unusually interesting relationship between a young child and man who are going through troubles in their respective lives. Everyone goes through problems, so it's nice to see people trying to overcome such large ones. If you're looking for a strictly horror movie, this is not the flick. I'm sure you can find haunted kids in The Shining or Insidious. The Sixth Sense goes beyond the average thriller since it deals with the supernatural and romance (which some may argue are not two entirely independent themes). I must say that I was happily surprised with this movie. It did start quite slowly but built a strong story gradually that really gets emotional. Rarely does a movie combine aspects of such contrast so effectively, but do in part to the solid acting, this movie certainly delivers a unique twist. All in all, The Sixth Sense was a terrific movie. The whole plot was carefully constructed and managed to turn a common mystery into a life lesson.  "

Its transformation capabilities yield it one of the strangest yet most powerful weapons introduced to the horror genre. The vulnerability of a population of any size certainly makes the Thing a being with infinite (chaotic) potential and one to hold in high regard. From the eerie soundtrack to sharp moments, The Thing certainly has the inner workings of a classic. Despite the great technical qualities, I was generally unmoved by the film. Although the oddity and atmosphere in the Antarctic was entertaining throughout, it was rather dull than pure excitement. The haunting and supernatural plot combined with the scary scenes and chilling vibrations surrounding every movement ensure a moment should not be missed. But alas, it was simply not a movie for me.

You can be certain that Kill Bill: Vol. 1 has a lot of fighting and adventure in nearly every scene, even when you least expect it. Waking up out of a coma for years is an immense task for anyone. Waking up out of a coma for years and then going on a rampage to seek revenge is superhuman. We follow the journey of an ill-fated woman in Kill Bill, known as the Bride, who lost everything on her wedding day including her husband, her unborn child and herself (almost). Killing people is not easy. Killing assassins...well, let Tarantino explain that. Although I love Tarantino and his unique style, there were definitely moments where the filming was just not up to par with the rest of his works. The Bride is definitely an interesting character with a rich and mysterious past that we, as viewers, are constantly trying to puzzle together. The enigmatic theme surrounding this film definitely adds to its suspense as well. With all this taken into consideration, I would have to say that Tarantino made a fine action film. Overall, Kill Bill is a solid movie. If you're looking for a fun film and want to fill the next two hours of your life with intense yet comical fighting, this is the movie for you.  "

Whether we actually care about these prejudices or not is personal, but Stand By Me inspiringly documents that we can transcend the labels on us, and further demonstrates that we should. Four young boys are searching for fun, for adventure, for a memorable experience. Upon hearing the shocking news of the location of a missing boy's body, they set out on a venture to find him and have their pictures in the newspapers. Throughout the journey, they discover a lot more--about themselves and the world--besides the ill-fated boy. This film is extremely nostalgic. Displaying the lives of adventurous and curious boys in the summer, who have been devoid of attention. These four twelve-year-old boys have experienced a great fortune of pain throughout their lives already, and they begin a trek to escape from their past for at least a short while. The whole movie revolves around the theme of friendship and overcoming challenges. We see the various emotions the boys feel, the suffering they undergo, and the will power that they have to be themselves. I truly enjoyed this Stand By Me since it's not your typical film of an adventure through the lands; no, it's an inspirational story of four boys who start the epoch of their lives. We all have personal trials that we go through. It could be the untimely death of a loved one, finding meaning in life, battling depression or just finding a purpose to live. Regardless of the challenges we endure, this film strongly depicts how vastly we transform and learn about ourselves when faced with controversy.  "

It's incredible how warm a dog can make a home that was once desolate. If you have ever had the fortune of owning a pet, you understand the strong attachment you have with one. You protect them, provide for them, and love them despite being unable to converse. You can see a dog's emotions just from its body language, and the dog comforts you when he/she realizes you're distressed. It's an amazing feeling to have such a unique bond to an animal that is so pure (like all creations), and views you as immaculate despite your imperfections. Unfortunately, you have probably had to endure difficult times of struggling health, senescence and inevitable death. It's this period of such great love followed by emptiness that is so hard to bear. Like any relationship, it is when there is a strain that you discover the true colours of those involved and discover everyone's true emotions. I once heard a story of a young boy saying that humans need more time in this world because they need to learn how to love and then reciprocate. Dogs on the other hand are born into the world already knowing how to love and that is why they don't need to live as long. Although I agree with the little child, I would also add that the pain that a pet would endure if its owner passed away would be unbearable. I wished there was a way to offer Hachi solace and tell him everything would be okay. I wish for a lot of things. Hachi was a loving dog who was saved by Parker. He's no ordinary dog...none ever are.  "

It's a terrifying thought to think you are constantly being monitored and purposely manipulated without cognizance. Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey) is just an average person (well not really) being watched by the entire world since his birth. Unaware of the world that exists outside of Seahaven, it's sad to consider a man with such genuine and adventurous dreams being limited in his life because of money. Having your life televised is one thing, but doing it without informed consent and only deceit and trickery is the primary reason this film strikes chords with people. It's a generally accepted view that beings should have the right to do with their lives as they wish. This fundamental freedom is taken away from an innocent person whose only mishap was being born to parents that didn't want him! Growing up in modern society, it is well known that we tend to take things for granted. Whether you're living in a closed dome or restricted by the government, freedom to choose is one of the most innate yet exploited aspects of society. It's an unnerving thought but maybe we are all living in a closed environment, playing the pawns; we just don't realize it.  "

Often times, films that deal with time travel tend to be confusing or full of holes, but The Terminator surprised me by developing a plot that was not only simple but emotional. The settings and mood throughout the entire movie really emphasize a state of panic, and it is definitely a thrilling experience from beginning to end. The acting is not exceptional, but nonetheless, the cast certainly does not fail in their respective roles. Every aspect of this movie was well planned, and the great combination of technical features and an overall sound script make this movie a model for all future action films. Although I wish they explored other options in fighting the Terminator, I guess that's what sequels are for. The Terminator takes viewers on a journey of constant fear, anxiety, and panic, and it's exactly because of this that The Terminator is a classic thriller.  "

Marvel has produced quite a few entertaining movies recently and I'd group this one closely together with Captain America 2 or Iron Man. Although it's not purely comedy or action, GotG combines these two genres beautifully making the entire watch entertaining. The comedic scenes went along very well with this movie--funnily lifting spirits after dark(er) moments. Not expecting it to be dramatic, it was fairly deep (though easy to follow along). Not extremely thought-provoking but emotional. GotG was a pleasant surprise for me. With previously subpar expectations, I will admit that I was either smiling, laughing or somewhat intrigued at any one frame in the movie. A classic from Marvel that I greatly enjoyed.  "

Finally got an opportunity to see it and to be honest, I was blown away by it. The movie lived up to it's rating here on IMDb.  For me, it's one the finest movies I've ever seen. The entire story is gripping and keeps you on the edge of your seat for it's entire duration. The movie wonderfully depicts the harsh life in prison, the helplessness and the eventual coping of the situation.  Freeman plays his role as the supporting actor wonderfully well and his narration is breathtaking. This movie has some of the most amazing dialogues ever in a Hollywood movie.  The core plot of the movie revolves around ""hope"" and the ability to see the silver lining even in the face of extremely challenging situations.  I could draw lots of parallels between this and Schindler's list, which is my most favorite movie of all time. Worth the watch. If you haven't watched this, YOU MUST.  This movie could possibly change your life. "

This movie takes the viewers right into the gruesome but realistic happenings of The Holocaust, in the backdrop of the Second World War. Steven Spielberg has done a fantastic job of making this movie as close to perfection as possible. The direction, the acting, especially that of Liam Neeson deserves applause and the black and white portrayal makes it even more heartening and gives a sense of timelessness, adds more to the 'hopelessness' theme as other reviewers here have mentioned. The movie is pretty long, about >3 hours but every second spent on this movie is worth. The storyline develops smoothly. It tracks the journey of a man named Oskar Schindler from a War Profiteer to that of a man who'd go on to save over a thousand Jewish lives from the horrors of The Holocaust. It also gives a very realistic portrayal of the life in Nazi occupied Poland. There's one particular scene that will melt away the toughest of hearts. I won't spoil it for you, but it's about a girl in red! Overall, it's one of the best movies made in the history of Hollywood and it's the best movie about World War 2 and The Holocaust. Worth watching, every bit. Personally for me, it's one of the best movies ever. Go watch it. 10/10. "

77709,tt0180093,abhinav,india,8,Innovative and unflinchingly gruesome,"Requiem for a Dream is, undoubtedly, an example of exquisite craftsmanship and visionary film-making. It reinforces the anti-drug theme- but this time round, Aronofsky decides to go for a frontal assault and leaves you with harrowing images. Briefly, the story charts the course of 4 lives, imperfect and ordinary to begin with, through three seasons. The Summer is the high of addiction, where things seem a little bit more colorful and hopeful than usual; the Autumn is when it all starts to crumble while the Winter marks the absolute destitution, even the death of hope. The visual techniques are what set this apart and the intriguing camera placements, split-screen scenes, the montages add to the experience. Coupled with the truly outstanding music, it is an attempt to get the audience invested in the proceedings. The performances are inch perfect, led by a brilliant Ellen Burstyn. My disquietude with the movie arises from the overt usage of striking visuals, a distinct attempt to gross the audience out. Aronofsky unravels the characters and their vulnerabilities- and just when you though that it was enough, he kicks you in the guts again. There is nothing redemptive in this movie at all, which I found disturbing.  "

But, all this while, we look for movies that defy genres, and touch us directly- so that our gaze lingers, contemplating, even as the credits roll. Pan's Labyrinth is an exquisite film, in the richness of its visuals, the audacity of its imagination, the tightness of its execution and the hope that pervades its story. Perhaps fantasy has a natural advantage in enrapturing its audience- but truly, this is why I watch movies. The progress of CGI and animation has been striking, but often it has become an impediment in the actual story-telling process. It is one of the great hallmarks of this film that the CGI enhances the story, making it even more compelling. The acting is solid, not great. But I recommend this movie for its beauty,a superbly haunting background score and a touching story, a bit rough around the edges ( some clich«∏d moments, some infuriatingly so) at times, but all in all- a sumptuous delight!

25518,tt1375666,Abhinav Bansal,united states,10,Power of Nolan !,"With expectations so high for Christopher Nolan after a movies like 'Memento', 'Batman Begins' and 'Dark Knight'; it is undoubtedly one of the best ever made in the history of film making. Just when Dark Knight made you feel that this is the best any movie can ever get, Nolan raises the bar even higher and gives ""INCEPTION"" to the world. He not only surpasses his own personal best but also the likes of the movies like 'Avatar' which has huge gained audience in recent times. The sheer perfection of this movie has blown the world away. ""What's the most resilient parasite? An Idea. A single idea from the human mind can build cities. An idea can transform the world and rewrite all the rules. Which is why I have to steal it."" Never in the past has any movie combined visual effects and intelligence in such excellently directed action scenes combined with visual effects that can make your jaw drop with a high but perfectly balanced shot of intelligence and imagination. In the past we have witnessed many unidirectional movies have shown grace only in visual effects ('Transformers' etc) or story ('Blind Side', 'Up In the Air') but no director has ever achieved the perfect mixture like Nolan did. Despite containing so much in the movie (action, drama, intelligence, thrill, maths, physics etc), it was smooth like a Symphony. Nolan prepared this with so much precision that you won't find any abrupt transition between action sequences and visual effects. This genius director has the ability to present his vision in such graceful manner demonstrating his powerful skills. He takes movie making to a whole new dimension ! His imaginative thoughts and increasing desire for perfection is making the world hungry for more. He defines Perfection! Inception has so much material and at the right pace to keep you at the edge of the seat for the entire duration of this masterpiece. Some scenes can even throw you off the seat. It will grip your attention like a strong magnet to a nail leaving you helpless but to watch and keep wondering of what will sweep you away next. One can't stop feeling gratitude for life to be honored by this movie. When it ends, you are bound to plan the next watch just for relishing the great work. Leo, my boy, was as the world knows him, One of the best actors to have lived in this era. And it is his aura that provokes the people around him to starve for achieving higher. Although his performance was better in 'Shutter Island' but he still was the best of the lot. After all it is he who sets high standards for the viewers to expect. A great balance between emotions has always been his key strengths. Over the years he has perfected his acting making him the ideal cast for a high profile movie like Inception. In fact, all the star cast was great. Ellen has evolved into a fine actress to join the league of Michael Caine, Joseph Gordon, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cotillard and Ken Watanabe. The sets and locations used in the movies are splendid. To be shot in 6 countries and such expensive sets is an achievement in itself. Combined with an Original, complex and imaginative script gives you an idea of the wonders Nolan is capable of doing when he is in the drivers seat. Its like he can talk to cameras placing them at correct locations and being able to shoot such striking shots proves his exemplary skills. The music is so good that it complements every aspect of the movie making it such a pleasure to watch. Hans Zimmer has indeed done a great job. His vivid ideas of venturing into the human mind has never been attempted in such a profound way. I can't help but wonder the kind of genius involved in coming up with a concept. The visual effects and action sequences are original and new which is something we have been missing for a long time. It is in fact so different that I won't be surprised if a book is written from this epic. Nolan surpasses the likes of Steven Spielberg and James Cameron becoming probably the most gifted directors in Hollywood history. I read someone's comment somewhere which stated that, ""If Nolan doesn't get an Oscar for best direction then there is something seriously wrong with the awards"" and I totally agree with this. It is just a matter of time that Oxford and Cambridge realize the necessity to add a new word to their dictionary. One which represents as a synonym to perfection and the ability to sweep people of their feet by one's genius. Maybe then it will make sense when I say, ""I am one of the millions who has been NOLAN'ed !!!""  "

131713,tt1392190,Abhinav Garg,india,9,A great movie,"A Review for ""MAD MAX: FURY ROAD "" Post-apocalyptic wastelands entice the general population of human for the simple reason that those worlds are being more and more imaginable by the day. Capitalizing on this macabre tendency of mankind, Australian film maker George Miller in his movie Mad Max: Fury Road, has shown a skeleton of a ruined civilization that is subsisting on scarce resources and brutal dictatorships. Under a flashy veneer of action-packed scenes and special effects, Miller has touched upon environmental and social issues that plague our society at the present moment. While the general premise of the movie is consistent with the previous movies in the franchisee, the very fact that Miller introduces strong female characters and fosters feminism is a welcome change. The story starts off with Max, wandering around in a desert, and who is finally captured to become a blood bad for a warrior called Nux. The villain has a stock of 'breeders' who are supposed to be his wives and bear his children. Most of his children turn out deformed and thus he is always trying for more. We awaits us is an show of patriarchal society suffering from a huge water crises.Some pieces were missing in the jig saw of story line. Movie was mainly bases on action which is delivered at par with the expectations In this bleak landscape, comes Inperator Furiosa, who helps the wives to escape and goes with them in search of 'The Green Place of Many Mothers'. Max gets caught up in the whirlwind and what ensues will make you think deeply about issues such as environmental crisis and feminism. At one point in the movie we see one wife ensuring another by saying ""We are people, not things!"". We see Nux, the war-boy, crack under the expectations placed on him. We see an entire population of human beings suffer because of the greed of a few people. We also see a flaming guitar in an army. This is a brilliant movie in its layering and one can take a lot out of it if one thinks about it. Movie is a must watch for action lovers however expecting a lot sense out of the story would be an injustice. Don't let the flaming guitar distract you from the real issues of the film.  "

Loki(Tom Hiddleston) has his moments to as major super villain. The movie has humor, and all in the right places.

List of people who were interestingly MAD: 1. Immorton JOE 2. All the warriors (Half dead/born who wanted valhallah) 3. Furiosa (The decision of escaping involved both madness and courage) During the first 15 minutes of the movie MAX was: 1. A brisk lizard eater (Obviously because lizard can't eat him instead) 2. A gruesome fighter who can try to escape from the prison just to be caught again. During the remaining movie MAX turned out to be: 1. A guy who scares unarmed innocent girls with a pistol and ends up getting bashed by a girl(Furiosa) 2. A very calm, composed and silent person who actually doesn't look violent at all(More like a saint). 3. A man who doesn't know how to use a Sniper rifle. 4. Who doesn't share his name as if it was supposed to be very confidential, may be he was like harry potter that if one comes to know his name they'll just keep chanting his name throughout the movie. Anyways Furiosa gave him a correct title of FOOL. 5. A man with no expressions in any circumstances maybe he knew that it's just a movie. What's there in the movie? First Half of the movie: It is about a War Rig being chased by the Warriors, lots of Fire,Crashes, Action, Music (Really want to appreciate the Guitarist who never stopped playing until his last breath, i believe his soul will RIP in Valhallah). Second Half: Please read the first half again. The Oscar should go to the WAR RIG for the Best Tanker in Leading Role (Yes because it was leading throughout the movie and nobody ever chased it down).

25554,tt1375666,Abhinav Sunder,india,9,Inception is the best game I have ever played!,"Inception is a film with such brilliance involved in its thinking that it makes James Cameron's over rated Avatar look like a pin ball inside a massive football stadium. Pardon me if I' am overdoing it, but I just can't come out of the experience I had watching this gigantic piece of cinema. Christopher Nolan, who gave us some of the finest films in the millennium like Memento and The Dark Knight, proves it once again that he has no suitable competitors presently. Now Leonardo DiCaprio is 'Dom Cobb', a high-end thief who can extract information out of a sleeping person's brain. Ken Watanabe plays 'Saito', a business man who hires 'Dom' to plant an idea inside the brains of his foe, 'Robert Fischer', played by Cillian Murphy. 'Saito' opts to implant an idea instead of stealing one as this idea will destroy the whole of his foe's business empire! Soon we see 'Dom' and his exciting team setting out for the toughest challenge they have ever witnessed, leaving the audience dumbstruck with the most exciting game they have ever played! Now talking more about the premise or its characters will only spill the beans over the fun of watching it; or to be precise, the fun of figuring out what is actually happening. And I hate to give out spoilers. The screenplay is par excellence, with a killer characterization given to each person involved in the cast, which gives you a feel that you know them all long back, right after you dig into the first few minutes of the film. Leonardo DiCaprio as Dom Cobb is nothing less than a stunner, where as the rest of the cast including Joseph Gordon, Tom Hardy, Dileep Rao, Ellen Page, Marion Cotillard, Cillian Murphy and Ken Watanabe blends into the characters. But its Christopher Nolan's screenplay, which constantly keeps you on the edge. You just don't have the time to rate the performances of the actors, when you already have a tedious job of understanding the film! More over, the film is a mind blowing visual extravaganza. Take for instance, the scene in which Dom Cobb trains the dreamer, in a dream she has with the city bursting out part by part, or even the scene in which the whole city folds itself into a book! But don't go into the cinema expecting some CGI driven film, and that's when you get completely lost. Because Inception is a film that tests your Intelligence and concentration; its a film which demands so much of attention that you might regret losing even a small detail, when you blink for a second. Now don't get me wrong on that; Inception is not that film which shows off its intelligence, its that film which defeats you with its intelligence. And its the best game I have ever played. Now the biggest challenge Christopher Nolan might face in the future is to outsmart his own creation. Because if Avatar was a landmark, Inception is the ultimate. No matter what happens, a bomb scare or even terrorist attack, never miss this one at the theaters. Its a film to die for. My Rating: 5 / 5 PS: By the way, I recommend this film only to those who have a minimum I.Q. level; because i hate it when people shout out loud nonsense in the theater when they have perfectly no clue about what is happening inside the film.

The casting of the movie is near perfect with William H Macy as Jerry, the classic bungler who triggers the tragedy of errors that ensue as he hires a couple of small time crooks to fake kidnap his wife, but really the show belongs to Frances McDormand as Marge - the police chief of a small town in the mid-west. Oh - and yes, the obligatory casting of the ever stellar, Steve Buscemi (really - why is he not in every movie?). Based on true events (edit: just found out that the term is very loosely used here), the movie is set in mid-west, USA and the Coen brothers make full use of this happy occurrence. The residents of a small town have their comfortable routine of shoveling snow - which, going be recent reports, is pretty much all one does in Minnesota - disturbed by a triple homicide by out of town criminals. Disturbed is an over statement as it doesn't bother them enough to even spit out the gum that they've been chewing for a week; Led by the heavily pregnant police chief - Marge. Oh Marge - Luckily this movie was before Christopher Waltz came and was not made by QT else Chris would have been all over the role even it meant being a pregnant man, but I diverge - Luckily, Marge is played by Frances who knocks it out with aplomb. All charm and ma'am but cold steel when required. The Coen brother tradition of characters dying unceremoniously out of turn is celebrated in Fargo as well. See, this is what i like about Tarantino and Coen brothers type of movies - not only are they memorable in whole but even their constituent pieces are individually remarkable. There is a sense of celebration of the art of making cinema; It has an artistic purity. But - I diverge again. Where were we ? Ah yes - The camera work is fresh and the dialogue indulgent with some hilarious extended exchanges conducted only in varying intonations of the word - ""Yeah"". Even if you haven't spent time in Minnesota, as I strangely have, it is still bloody funny to watch. This then, truly is a delicious concoction - parts Coen brother zaniness, parts Tarantano'ish violent indulgence, on a base of a Guy Ritchie plot of criminal incompetence, completed with superb performances and inspired casting.

43304,tt0816692,abhinav-prkash,india,5,"A great painter, A grand canvas and A childish doodle","Interstellar, despite its take on intergalactic travel, event horizon, blackhole, space-time warp, and 5 dimensions, is too naive and elementary work of an otherwise great director. It can also be said it's a 3 hours long and 300 million dollars tribute to 15 minutes of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Either way, the idea I am trying to send across this wormhole is that Interstellar is an infantile and immature movie that could had been fun, had it not taken itself too seriously. Stripped off all the bells and whistles, the key plot element of Interstellar is the ancient concept of time-travel and how you can revisit your past to send signals that your past self thought coming from providence or their guardian angels. Deja Vu? Yes indeed! After all this is the very plot device that is at the heart of Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban. So the main problem with Interstellar is that it doesn't have anything new to offer. On top of it you have some dead serious actors who talk and talk and talk and talk about concepts of love, belief, faith, and trust while crossing wormholes, black holes, event horizons and what not. And then they talk some more on every planet that they visit. Well, the movie is not a complete wash-off thanks to a very impressive and realistic performance by Matthew McConaughey whose powerful acting somewhat lift up a movie that runs haywire most of the time because Nolan was playing with concepts beyond his ken. I am sure that by the time he was half way through directing it, even he did not have an idea that what the heck he was making. But I believe that's okay for once. Every great director deserves to make one or two duds in their career so my faith in Nolan is not yet broken. One small note for sci-fi fans. the physics used here is just the elementary theoretical physics which no can prove and no can disprove. In fact it will be more correct to day that this movie uses meta-physics more than physics -example- Love is presented as the 5th dimension of universe and belief can overcome all physical odds-like easily locating a floating astronaut in the infinite swathe of universe!

Death Hallows Pt 2, for some time to come, will remain as the foremost example of a movie that could had been a classic if not for the grand opportunity missed, or rather wasted by the director and the crew. It had every resource at command- a very talented set of actors, latest 3D and computer technologies, and a 10 years old legacy to guide its way to greatness. But quite inexplicably it refused to even say 'accio' to these sources, and instead, after running impressively through half the way to summit, it wandered, stumbled, and then jumped off the path into same abyss where Harry is made to throw the Elder wand at end.

The scene in vault where artifacts start to multiply or the flight of dragon are superlatively done, there is no question to it. But once inside the castle, the fizz suddenly goes off the movie. Yates wanted to rush towards boom boom explosions with such haste that it let the thing implode on itself. And so the second half becomes a rubble of montages and frozen frames crashed in a monumental heap where Harry Potter fans like me are still trying to find some meaningful pieces together. To put it another words, the entire second half of the movie is just arranged together- there is no feeling introduced, no association built with the characters, no bridges created (but blown away certainly). It just compilation of images one after another. Pretty, no doubt, but Mr. Yates, ought to know that in wizarding world people in images also have soul; and the second half had not a shred of soul in it. And therefore, I did not feel any personal sense of loss when Hogwarts shook and crumbled, when Fred, Lupin , Tonks and so many others died, and quidditch ground burned to ashes. Damn you David Yates- I had loved Hogwarts more than my own school, had ROFLed at Fred's quips and jeers, followed wizard quidditch more than Ron, and had made friends with Harry's batchmates. You dehumanized the entire saga, and left me with not even a feeling of mourning at these losses and worse-- neither one of jubilation at Harry's triumph. And this is my principle discontent. In the movie, the climatic fight between Harry and Voldi occurs completely isolated and away from everyone. There is no one to watch watch this epic struggle which was building since last 7 years of the movie chronology. It was absurd and spoiled the movie for me. I had never liked the 7th book much, but still the conversation between Voledomort and Harry at the end was thrilling and enthralling ∂? equally moving was Harry's conversation with Dumbledore's portrait. Yate's machination constructed an altogether different and vastly inferior ending. As a foot-note, this is still a tolerable movie- and certainly not 'OMG-worst-movie-i-ever-saw' kind of stuff. Pity is that, it could had been much much much better.  "
67216,tt1345836,abhinav-prkash,india,7,An entertaining end to a majestic saga,"The Dark Knight Rises is an entertaining action movie. The almost unceasing action comes because the story demands it. You know Gotham cannot survive the mayhem by hordes of thugs unless there is so much action, and it almost doesn't survive. It does though courtesy a physically and emotionally wounded billionaire, who puts everything personal behind to 'Rise' to the crisis. The emotional anguish of Bruce Wayne/Batman is anguish of a man who doesn't have a choice but to stick to the code book he has written for himself. This come-what-may-but-I-will-do-only-this approach which makes Bruce Wayne so predictable also leaves him vulnerable against anyone who cares to take him down. The Dark Knight Rises is more a story of conflicts, crises, weaknesses, strengths,despairs and victory of Bruce Wayne than Batman. It's Bruce Wayne who is tricked and deceived, its its Bruce Wayne who suffers loss of fortune and pride, Bruce Wayne who forces himself into an emotional exile, and Bruce Wayne who finally emerges from the depth of hopelessness in the final showdown between the good and the bad. Batman is just a costumed Bruce Wayne, wearing the suit to give himself some combat mileages. Christian Bale once again shows how good actor he is with so much screen time at his disposal. We see the actor who gave those flawless performances in 3:10 to Yuma and The Machinist. Nothing much can be written about Michael Cain that has not already been said. He is one of those actors who always fool you into believing that their character is a real person.Morgan Freeman is as stylish and irreproachable as ever, although I felt his character is largely a prisoner of circumstances in the final version of trilogy. Gary Old-man turns out another stellar performance of a cop who believes in hope and his ideals. On the other side, Anna Hathaway as the Cat-woman is charming but wholly dispensable in the entire scheme of story and Marian Cotillard about manages to delivery what's expected out of her.Almost. So that's about it. Or did I miss out on something? No I did not, cause missing out on Bane means nothing. This purported nemesis of Batman turns out to be a tall, muscular, deep voiced thug who can lift batman up and break his spine and has a character as deep as an inverted spoon, and exactly as much interesting. Don't even think of expecting to see anything even remotely close to the wiry, twitchy, grungy maniac who wouldn't dare touch Batman until he was down on his knees, but such an evil genius that it was a shame Batman even managed to survive to rise again is . Yes Gentlemen, some phenomena appear perhaps only once in a life time. And it's only 4 years to that majestic, unsurpassed, mystic, and foreboding phenomena called the Joker.   "

1402,tt0111161,abhinaygoga,india,10,Great movie,"Excellent inspirational movie to watch... extreme worth to spent time on this Forget about what others (including myself) might suggest you'll discover in ""The Shawshank Redemption;"" when you watch it, you'll identify something very personal in your own life with a scene, a character, or a moment in this uncomplicated movie. When you need hope, you'll look for Shawshank. When you want to believe in the will of overcoming even the greatest obstacles, Shawshank will uplift you in ways that you can't find in movies today.   Some liken the film to some kind of spiritual awakening. Of course, some can go to a church or mosque to find enlightenment and Faith in humanity, but most places of worship are open only certain days or times. But when you need affirmation of the lasting bond of friendships that prevail over the most dire circumstances, Shawshank will give it to you. It makes grown men (like me) cry, still. I wonder whether Shawshank was truly meant for viewing in the privacy of the home, because it is a personal experience that really makes you look inward. Nominated for seven, this is the best film that never one a single Oscar.   How ironic that an innocent man winds up being surrounded by the corruption of the legal system. Shawshank itself is similar to the character of Andy Dufresne. Prejudging this classic film, critics couldn't get past the title. The public followed suit, initially dismissing Shawshank, which failed in the box office just like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane."" It could have just whithered away on the store shelves, like Andy Dufresne could have in his own cell. But the characters prevailed, because Andy -- And Shawshank -- stayed true. Now, these movies are right up there as the most popular films of all time.   Anyone who has yet to watch Shawshank may be so jaded of movies, or the film's title, or how a 2-1/2- hour movie set inside the walls of a prison can manage to tap the soul of such a wide range of people. Shawshank has not one explosion. I wonder if it even has a single special effect or digitally- enhanced frame. "

Nolan drives us through an unforgettable journey in the world of Passion (read as magic), Ego (tussle to outclass your competitor at any cost) and a thrilling cinematographic masterpiece which is here to stay. Chistopher Nolan is known more for his work in modern classics like Memento (2000) & the Batman series but this movie remains my personal favourite of his works. Michael Caine and Chritian Bale (both personal favourites of Nolan while casting) give an stellar performance yet again but the one who completely dazzled me in this one is Hugh Jackman. The man to man war between Jackman & Bale to outsmart each other in the magic tricks is a treat to watch. Scarlett Johannsson is pretty as always and gives good support to the men here. The Non linear Story telling (which is trademark of Nolan's work) only adds to the suspense and beauty of this film. As the pages are unfold, It completely keeps you on the edge of your seats. I would definitely not like yo ruin your experience by leaking something out of the story. Watch out for the climax which completely left me dazzled personally. The 1900's set up charismatically elevates the cinematic experience & the background score is dangerous for your nails (Pls don't bite ur nail while watching this :P). I rate this movie 10/10 as very few films have impressed me to this level. Good Work Nolan and keep it up. Eagerly waiting for your Inception (2010).

93696,tt0372784,Abhishek (moviebuff81),australia,10,One of the most brilliant superhero films of all time,"Batman is one of the most popular superheros of all time. I, for one, have grown up reading Batman comics. Therefore, I look forward any film (animated or otherwise) that involves Batman. However, Batman Begins stands out as the best superhero film of all time. Why, you may ask. Batman Begins is not only a brilliant portrayal of the story of Batman, but it also happens to be a remarkable effort at film-making. I have followed the career of Christopher Nolan very closely and this will be remembered as one of his landmark films. Christian Bale gives the performance of a lifetime and its amazing to see how such good talent goes unnoticed for so long. Gary Oldman is reliable as always and doesn't take the focus off the main character. The cast in general was extremely good and a special mention should be made of Liam Neeson and Ken Watanabe. They bring real character to the story. The most outstanding feature of the film is the fact that it humanises the character of Batman. We see the transition from Bruce Wayne to Batman. It is interesting to see how the characters look so real, although the film belongs to the fantasy genre. The audience is left to decide which role (Batman or Burce Wayne) is the actual masquerade. If you haven't seen this film yet, GO watch it! I would like to stress again that this film DOES not belong to the earlier lot of semi-dark/comedy films with Clooney, Jim Carrey, etc. This film is absolutely true to the character of Batman; it is dark in every sense and leaves you captivated.

25693,tt1375666,Abhishek Bhattacharya,india,10,A Spectacular Mind-Bending Surreal Experience,"Inception is a viscerally breathtaking, emotionally engaging, thought provoking, preposterous but at the same time ingenious creation from the mind of one of the most creative, talented and amazing directors existing today, Christopher Nolan, who has also directed other great movies such as ""The Dark Knight"", ""Batman Begins"", ""The Prestige"" and ""Memento"". It is an impenetrable, lucid and psychologically complex investigation into the various layers of the sub-conscious dream state, combined with some amazing, fascinating and spectacular action set-pieces with superb special effects. The multi-layered labyrinthine plot may be too obscure to comprehend at the first viewing and requires subsequent multiple viewings with great concentration to fully grasp and decipher this engaging, bold, complicated and often intentionally ambiguous plot. The Cast and their performances are superb, spearheaded once again by Leonardo Di Caprio who is fast transforming into one of the greatest actors of this generation, aptly supported by Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Marion Cottilard, Ken Watanabe & Dileep Rao. Also, brilliant cameo performances by Michael Caine & Tom Berenger helps to transcend this captivating movie into greater heights. The superb cinematography by Wally Pfitser and the sublime music by Hans Zimmer is spot on and blends nicely with the overall feel and atmosphere of this movie, adding to the spectacle. I don't want to go into the specifics of the plot for its best to watch this movie with absolutely no idea about it, the way Nolan wanted it to be. Still the basic outline consists of this: Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a master thief with a shady past who specializes in breaking into people's dreams and stealing their ideas, is given an opportunity by a mysterious businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe) to redeem everything he's ever done, and in the process reunite with the children he left in the U.S. when he was forced for shady reasons to flee the country. Saito's offer includes completing an impossible mission, for which Cobb must assemble the best team ever compiled for such a mission. Saito's particular offer involves planting an idea in the head of the heir (Cillian Murphy) of his greatest rival (Pete Postelthwaite), a process called ""inception"". The rest of the movie is up to the audience to watch, grasp, enjoy and interpret, especially the conclusion which is one of the most interesting, innovative and original ""open to interpretation"" ending that is sure to keep many viewers mesmerized and bewildered for days and weeks after the initial viewing. Finally, In a nutshell, this without a shadow of a doubt is the greatest achievement in movie-making in the year 2010 and it firmly deserves all the accolades, plaudits and honours it will receive in the future. Definitely a must watch for movie buffs, this future ""Oscar contender"" will most certainly provide all the audiences with a ""Riveting, once in a lifetime, roller coaster ride"" experience that must not be missed for anything else in the world.

67598,tt1345836,Abhishek Bhattacharya,British Indian Ocean Territory,10,The Big Daddy of all Superhero Movies is finally upon us....,"After being fortunate enough to watch an advanced preview screening, I can safely say that.............................. TDKR is a fitting finale and a grand conclusion to the epic trilogy of the Batman series, as envisaged by Christopher Nolan, who definitely cements his place as one of the best directors of the modern generation with his trademark ""relentlessly intense storyline, utterly chaotic dystopian society riddled with totalitarian government & cyber-genetic technologies, stark and bleak portrayal of human pessimism and misanthropic attitude as well as superbly spectacular big-budget Hollywood set-pieces of massive destruction, chaos, catastrophe and pandemonium."" The real world threats of global terrorism, political anarchy and economic instability make deep incursions into the cinematic comic book domain in TDKR. Even though indispensably it lacks an element as unique as Heath Ledger's immortal and memorable turn in ""The Dark Knight"", it compensates for that by being fully enveloping and at times unnerving in a relevant way one would never have imagined. The director daringly pushes the credibility of a Gotham City besieged by nuclear-armed revolutionaries to such an extent that it momentarily seems absurd for a guy in a costume who refuses to kill people, unmasked and debilitated, emotionally shattered and physically drained, leading the life of a retired recluse, to conceivably show up to save the day but due to the laconic, succinct yet lucid storyline, manages to do so impeccably and masterfully. As before, the production values are opulent and sensational; nothing short of the highest praise can be lavished on the work of the production designers, The only conspicuous faux pas is a big continuity gaffe that has the raid on the Stock Exchange take place during the day but the subsequent getaway chase unfold at night. While Some of the action scenes have something of a ""deja-vu"", familiar feel the others are fresh and brilliantly rendered, manifesting the brilliant visual spectacle of epic proportions. Despite the high level of suspension of disbelief, dark tone and sometimes lugubrious approach, this is a finely crafted and prudently structured plot, providing just about sufficient and adequate time for character development, tying all the knots from the previous iterations & installments, yet avoiding UN-necessary confusions and myopic plot twists, never allowing levity to intrude the conflicted, sinister and flawed outlook of the principal characters. The stellar performance by the entire cast and the dramatic, haunting background score alleviates and effortlessly transforms the sheer scope of Nolan's vision ∂? with emotion and spectacle thundering across the screen ∂? for its entire running time of nearly 3 hours. Most importantly, TDKR unequivocally manages to achieve the impossible, which is to bring a cherished cinematic chapter to a close, yet manage to leave the fans feeling neither desolate nor forlorn but essentially cheerful, one steeped enough in self-contained mythology to reward hard-core fans while giving less invested viewers a rousing, adroitly executed piece of popcorn entertainment. In the end, this is a sequel that not only succeeds but easily surpasses the enormous weight of hyped-up lofty expectations built ridiculously high by fan culture and savvy marketing. TDKR transcendence the art of movie-making into an entirely different level, that had been hitherto unseen and unheard of previously in any kind of super-hero, comic-book adaptations to the big screen till date. This Brilliant and Exemplary exercise of groundbreaking accomplishment in movie-making must not be missed by any movie buffs, let alone ""Batman affectionados"". 10/10.  "

And now that i have seen it I can say that i was very surprised by the dialogues and the script. The script was witty, smart and well written. The main plot was of course simple, that of a man( in this case a God) wanting to take over the world, but apart from that clich«∏ plot point the script was very good. It was more character based than plot based. The movie gave enough individual time to the heroes(other than hawkeye) in terms of screen time. The point of the film was a team assembling and that team dynamic was brilliantly written and acted. The heroes fought, they disagreed, they had different opinions to things, they had different reasons to go to war, but at the end despite their differences they came together. This team dynamic was brilliantly handled by Joss Whedon. The script was funny at times as well, Joss whedon knew that the avengers wasn't supposed to be a dark knight, it wasn't supposed to be realistic and gritty and scattered with various themes, so instead of making a mindless michael bay film he added his own unique touches which gave the movie and the characters depth while also preserving the summer blockbuster flavour. Each character played a specific part in this team, captain America played the loyal/bound by duty super soldier who turns out to be a brilliant tactician as well. Iron man provided the team with flying abilities and brilliant weaponry, thor had personal reasons to fight this battle, while HULK well he was an unstoppable monster! The scope of this film is huge, unlike any other super hero film. The opposition that these heroes faced could not be dealt by one hero alone and hence the stakes in this movie are much higher and the heroes know that. Some realistic themes were also introduced like whether SHIELD should make nuclear weapons to protect itself from the other worldly armies, these themes were quite relevant in today's times. There were quite a few smart writing choices that whedon made that i cant talk about without giving spoilers. The acting as expected was brilliant. Robert Downey, Chris Evans, Mark Rufallo, Scarlett Johanson,Chris hemsworth and Jeremy renner were all brilliant at their roles. The black widow got more screen time then i expected but that was welcome. The action I thought was very large scale, although i think and i know many might disagree with me, but the action could have been more grander in some parts. All in all this movie was everything it was supposed to be. It balanced the script,the dialogues,the characters and the action very well. Don't compare this to the dark knight cause this is not supposed to be gritty and intense, just be happy that the movie gives to you more than you expected it to.

The direction by Christopher Nolan is one of a kind and the audience is bound to the movie from start till end. There is not even a single moment of boredom or disinterest. The acting is one of the best. Heath Ledger has given the performance of a lifetime. A fast paced action thriller, Action packed performances by all actors including Christian Bale, Heath Ledger and more a class apart direction makes the movie excellent. Background Score is award winning. The Dark Knight sets a standard so high that is incomparable to any movie you have watched till day. My advice would be to watch this movie right now. Thank me later. "
185,tt0111161,ABHISHEK JAT,india,10,One of those kind of movies which come only once in a lifetime.,"The review may contain spoilers!! The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that everyone will surely enjoy. The movie begins with a slow pace and as time passes you begin to love the characters and in the later part of the movie you wish it goes on and on. While watching the film, you expect a different type of ending(kind of an ordinary one). But at the end you realize that this is not an ordinary movie. The movie contains a very good message for all of us. The kind of patience and hope that Andy has is simply brilliant. Morgan has done a good job too(as usual). He has done his role as ""Red"" with complete dedication. The dialogues and background music help you to get completely involved in the movie. There are two scenes which leave you with an awe! The first one is when Andy gets out of prison by travelling through the drainage pipes and then enjoys the rain falling on him. And the second one is at the end when Red is released from the prison and Andy waits for him at a beach. My favorite dialogue is ""Remember Red, Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things and no good thing ever dies."" "
152870,tt2084970,ABHISHEK JAT,india,8,Benedict's performance makes it a must watch.,Well when a movie like 'The imitation game' is nominated for Oscar awards you feel happy because it deserves a nomination. The movie revolves around Alan Turing (Benedict) and his efforts to decrypt the Enigma codes used by Germans in their battle against the Allies. The story is pretty straight forward but it is the plot and the screenplay which keeps you bonded with the movie. The film also reveals the dark side of our society and its mentality about homosexuals. Alan is a complete genius and Benedict looks so natural that you forget that he is just playing a character of Turing. Kiera Knightley does her role pretty well. The other supporting characters of the film are good as well. Overall a must watch film!!  
43995,tt0816692,Abhishek Jha,india,9,"A Spectacular Journey to save mankind leaving ""Gravity"" behind.","After months of anticipation, watching trailers repeatedly i got a chance today to revisit the Nolan's magic and to speak the truth Christopher Delivers the best to meet the expectations of his audiences. Christopher Nolan's ""Interstellar"" definitely meets the excitement and expectations which one can have after watching Inception.To be honest it leaves the spectacular movie "" gravity"" far behind and shows mankind in a paradigm of space between spaces. Although hard to believe ""mankind"" is so lucky to cross the Intergalactic journey in one shot but the movie does takes you with itself.Nolan through this film has struck right nodes to ensure the audiences go for an interstellar ride considering the situations on Earth. The movie clearly takes us in the flight of future and motivates mankind to achieve what it can to survive. Impressed by Nolan's direction & screenplay, the actors have done equal justice to their roles.Matthew McConaughey steals the show with his never say die attitude and some of the emotional scenes with his daughter are really very heart touching.The other supporting actors along with Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain have impressed with their graceful performances. This is what i like in Nolan's direction in which characters promote the story rather than putting themselves above the movies. By the way i was amazed seeing Matt Damon playing the bad guy with such a short role. Now common !!! is he really so desperate to be in Nolan's movies ??? For me someone else would have been a much better fit but Nolan did surprise us well. This movie also gives an important message about our planet ""Earth"" which is so beautiful and what could happen if we lost this paradise.Not to be sure we would too find wormholes to 5th dimension but deteriorating climate could show us some mirror. I quite surprised & happy to see Indian Air force Drones able to surveillance with 10 years of solar battery capacity. Wonder when will those be actually used in India for curbing Crimes. Besides, all the hypes & hysteria Interstellar is definitely the Movie worth its wait and deserves to be watched by worldwide audience.A round of applause again for the director for being the master integrator of events in his movies and of course to the Spectacular journey of space. We will be waiting for Christopher Nolan next flick till we get out of Interstellar hangover by watching it at least twice. Thanks.  "
89625,tt1187043,ABHISHEK JOSHI,india,6,"An average movie which still is better than most of the comedies which rolled out this year in Bollywood (Yes, that's the sorry state of Bollywood these days!).","Chetan Bhagat's novel on which it is loosely based, is not a literary masterpiece but it succeeds in selling what it promises. I think a more serious, drama with subtle humor approach should have been used to make a good movie out of that novel. What we have got in 3 Idiots is another addition to the streak of mindless comedies. One movie genre which has suffered the most in recent years is comedy and movies like 'Jane bhi do yaron' or even 'Andaz apna apna' or many of the Hrishikesh Mukherjee's movies are not made anymore. What we get these days is run of the mill gags with jokes copied from youtube (Search 'funny student at exam hall' if you want to see an example). Rajkumar Hirani has tried to emulate the success of Munnabhai films by using the same formula but has tried to pull one too many a stunt this time. Munnabhai movies were fresh, something new always works! Repeating same thing over and over is what killed 3 Idiots. Amir tries hard and gets away with it but definitely younger actors could have done a better justice. Madhavan as an actor and narrator fails big time in this movie. An actor like Sharman Joshi who has done quite decent job till now in comedies isn't given much meat in his role. In fact I would have loved to see him do the role of Rancho! Boman Irani's character is straight out of a cartoon book and its not funny at all. Surprisingly, Kareena Kapoor has done a very good job in the smaller than others role she got. It seems she succeeds in carrying this role forward from Jab We Met! Finally, I would say that this movie has soul, it has a message(in fact may be one too many ;) but it lacks execution. It fails to stick to this message with heart because of senseless and unbelievable comic scenes which are forcefully thrusted to get some quick laughs but ultimately prove to be roadblocks in the storyline. Many situations in the movie are so hard to believe that you can only gulp them down if the movie was a spoof which it is not. I have seen(and have been a part of) much crazier things when I was in engineering college but still what they show here is simply stupid. Watch this movie if you want to relax and watch some mindless comedy where you have to apply your brain... 6/10 for me.  "
19667,tt0120737,Abhishek Kumar,india,10,A Beautiful start for the trilogy,"This is a movie you wanna watch before you die. This movie is a real beauty, if you watch it once you will watch it again and again. I think this movie has the best startup commentary among all the Hollywood movies and the voice of Galadriel here is ethereal. The depiction of Gollum's character in a shadowy manner is quite terrific. Also some of the scenes at the beginning of the movie of the battle is ecstatic in spite of the fact that this movie has mainly concentrated on fights not battles. Here the adaptation is thorough though 3.5 hrs is not enough to capture all the intricate details like, Tom Bombadil and the escape of Bilbo Baggins from the Gollum's cave etc. The whole movie seems majestic and it is very difficult not to like it. Let it be the Bridge of Khaza-dum,the Bree, the gates of Rivendell, the mines of Moria, etc every bit of it is terrific. Also, one cannot forget the depiction of the Shire which looks so innocent a place and the stress on the color green is absolutely stunning. If you ever going to plan to see this movie see it now and I know you'll like it and I mean every second of it.  "
31491,tt0133093,Abhishek Kumar,india,10,there is a spoon!!!!!!!!!,"From the first time I watched the movie....I wanted to write something, albeit I wanted that piece of writing to be phenomenal. First time I watched the movie when I passed high school, though at that time it should've gone bouncer over me if my brothers wouldn't have been there. I was simply bowled over, but I didn't know it will keep coming back in different shades. Then I watched it again and again, I understood a bit more, then came all the other parts, I came to my Insti, then in 2nd yr of my B.Tech. I watched it about 10 times more, then I started experiencing another level of the matrix i.e. the one related to Bhagwat Gita. Your life(life in the matrix), enlightenment(free your mind), spiritual life(life in real world) and on and on. This movie my friend is more than what you can imagine, watch it if you are a movie lover, sci fi addict, spiritual, human and above all if you are ""plugged"". I like all the dialogs of the matrix and I think I remember 50% of the script. This movie is made to rock your life. The dialogs are the best part of the matrix......so script/screenplay is nice, cinematography is good but amateur, direction and all is good, acting I think is not required here. But above all the visual effect. And ya that is also the cinematography when the scene freezes and revolves, they used I think 12 cameras for that. My personal favorite.  "

Though I am not very much impressed with the dialogs, thats why I have voted it 9/10 ... Only a few very good dialogs are there and that too in the end of the movie Cinematography is also not remarkable... Sound editing is good and there is not much scope for costumes and sets...

This movie will blow you away. Nolan has done it again and this time better. It couldn't be a spectacular end to an immortal saga. People say that the third outing is always tricky as there is lot of pressure to present a convincing plot for the audience in a way that the trilogy culminates into one phenomenal celluloid experience. Nolan has undoubtedly, outdone himself with his latest film which also happens to be the last in the Batman franchise. Every character in this movie have given there best performances till date. Hans Zimmer's magical music is still giving me goosebumps. This is the best Superhero film i've seen. Nolan's twist can be felt in the movie which will always keep you on the edge of your seat. Its a Must Watch movie..not only once but many a times. Take a bow Christopher Nolan. Desi Desi Basara basara!!!!  "

Cinematography is good, screenplay is linear....Direction is too good....

But, this one movie will always fascinate me.  I don't know whether its it story or what? I think it's his characters. Every character in the movie, right from, Sonny to Michael has its own impact.  The hero of the movie for me, was Godfather, himself and not Michael.  What I like most about GF, was that he was not like we have seen Gunshots in other and most of movies. He was calm and was much like a business tycoon. He was humble and respectful.  The story turns out that how a man, who wasn't and didn't want to get into all that mafia stuff, get into, for his father and family.  The film doesn't have a great story, but it has grip and aura, which fascinates the viewer. "
820,tt0111161,Abhishek Prakash,india,10,"Life in a prison, Andy's way....","Undoubtedly, Shawshank Redemption is the greatest prison drama ever made. Andy's life is turned upside-down when he is convicted of killing his wife and send to the prison. He has to fight all the evils of the society he was never trained for. He makes friends with Ellis Redding and his bumpy journey in prison continues.  Very few movies have the great combination of story, music and casting; SR hits highs on all notes. Morgan Freeman gave his best performance as Ellis Redding and his narration is one of the many reasons why this movies is considered among the greatest.  Favourite Quote : ""... and when they put you in that cell, when those bars slam home, that's when you know it's for real. A whole life blown away in the blink of an eye. Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it."" "

Well, I've now seen the movie and I just don't see what those guys are talking about. The movie's awesome, more so when you watch it in IMAX. The story, locales, the special effects, background score, dialogues, acting - everything comes together perfectly and the almost-3-hours go past in a whiz. We get to see more of Bruce Wayne than Batman (though not as much as in ""Batman Begins"") and Christian Bale does give a nice performance. Same goes for the others too (though as charming as Anne Hathaway appeared in all her scenes, I'd have preferred seeing the gorgeous self of Selina Kyle in non-black-dresses too). One sore point was Bane's voice. The garbled-speech pattern in his ""voice"" was little unsettling and at times the background score would drown his dialogues out. Just like Batman's voice in ""The Dark Knight"", this was disappointing. The dialogues, at certain times, would appear a little contrived and not ""fit"" the scene. In all honesty, the movie wasn't as good as TDK, but it was close. And a part of the reason behind it is that in TDKR, the villain is not as enigmatic as The Joker. Tom Hardy does give a good performance as Bane, but there is only so much you can act with just your eyes and half your face in a mask. Many have felt that the ending could've been better. I, on the contrary, felt that the ending was the most appropriate end that the trilogy could've had. All said and done, there is no doubt that the movie is right up there with the rest of Chris Nolan's movies and he continues to dazzle the viewers with his brilliance.  "

There are two possibilities, either you make them or break them. Well in É?¶É??WhiplashÉ?™, Damien Chazelle actually did this job remarkably. Acting is superb. Miles Teller and J. K.

105819,tt0080678,Abhishek Rathi,india,7,A typical David Lynch Tale,This was on my watch list for long time and last weekend finally got the time to see this heart touching story. Movie tells us the story of heavily disfigured man & his sufferings and how one man struggle to rescue this person and make a name for himself. But still few questions are left unanswered at the end of the story. Screenplay is crisp and movie moves swiftly. There are few loopholes in the story and few character are not clearly defined e.g. Mr. Treves motive to save elephant man is not clearly defined. Anthony Hopkins is good in surgeon role. In spite of heavy makeup John has delivered an excellent performance and his body language reflects his emotion. Watch the scene between him and the crowd on railway platform. Overall a good watch and worth your time.

The interesting part was the theme, the boring part was that the movie felt like drag at some points. The best part is the realistic make believe storytelling, with the special effects and decent performances. It was good to see Harrison Ford in quite a different role, a more serious one, in contrast to his roles in Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Even without the VFX fighting scenes or robots, this movie is a decent watch for sci-fi fans. It ends at just the right time, which I liked. I'm glad I finally watched Blade Runner.  "
1176,tt0111161,Abhishek Sharma (abhishek4889),india,8,Wonder full,"This is simply one of the best films ever made and I know I am not the first to say that and I certainly won't be the last. The standing on the IMDb is a true barometer of that. #3 as of this date and I'm sure it could be number 1. So I'll just skip all the normal praise of the film because we all know how great it is. But let me perhaps add that what I find so fascinating about Shawshank is that Stephen King wrote it.  King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that beautifully.   What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there will again. "

64203,tt0095327,Abhishek Srivastava,india,10,A Moving Experience,"Beware, this is not a movie for people with weak hearts. Keep a box of tissue ready with you always while watching. I read a lot about Grave of the Fireflies before watching and this kind of research generally leads to decrease in intensity of the film while watching as one generally expects what is going to happen. However, it didn't happen with this. It was not only more overwhelming than I imagined, it was more overwhelming than I could have imagined. As soon as the movie starts, you know how it's going to end, but still can not bear to watch as scene by scene unfolds and you are hoping and praying that the scene does not end in the worst possible way. You are hoping to end the misery for the little kids as much as for you. I am very certain that I will never watch this film again as I can not go through the pain. However, I recommend everyone to watch it at least once. The things I liked about this film were: 1. Amazing portrayal of a war situation. You will not find any more realistic and sad portrayals of the effects of war 2. Contrast: The contrast of the innocence of kids with the hatred and suffering of war 3. Helplessness: There is nothing more heartbreaking than the face of a helpless child. You get to see it so much in this film. It is truly heart-wrenching. 4. Special moments: This characteristic is very familiar in almost all Ghibli films, where you get an amazingly real portrayal of exchanges between two people that is almost impossible to create artificially and that is what I like so much about all Ghibli films. E.g. the scene where the brother and sister are taking a bath, among others. 5. Untouched/Non-discussed subjects: Subjects such as guilt, depravity, etc. are more than touched in this film. This makes it unique among animated films or even among live action films. I remember very few films that have such an effect on me. Perhaps, none will ever will and that is the importance of this film for me. This, according to me, is one of the finest Studio Ghibli films ever made. It is one of the most moving films I have ever seen and will probably ever see in my life. It doesn't get the recognition it deserves. When people start watching Ghibli films, they generally tend to focus on Hayao Miyazaki films, and films such as these get neglected. However, this film by Isao Takahata is up there with the best films ever made animated or non-animated. I don't get the fact that people say that this deserves a live action film. I say that live action films don't deserve this script. I don't understand the hatred for animation and the movement towards effects rather than story. I for one, am a fan of animation, and this credit goes only to Studio Ghibli. Hats Off!!!  "
155981,tt2015381,Abhishek Srivastava,india,7,Good Entertainment!!! Typical Marvel..,"Well, some of the lesser known heroes (and villains) of the marvel universe come together and the result is not all bad. It's an entertaining film. There is a lot of action and a lot happening in the film to keep you preoccupied and not focus on the larger scheme of things. It has many typical marvel characteristics like: 1. The characters are simple. They are not introduced. They are just there. 2. There is little or no character development. We are told that a certain character likes this or hates that without much reason or thought process 3. Its fast paced. Leaving you occupied without focusing on the broader scheme of things and concentrated on the action at hand 4. The characters are either good or evil (not otherwise) 5. They hate each other in the beginning and combine together at the end (big surprise there..). They are selfish at first but a bigger cause unites them. 6. They all are after a small tiny object which supposedly is key to unlimited power. The film is highly entertaining. The characters are funny. One liners are pulled off nicely. There are emotional moments. All in all, it felt like Avengers 2 with lesser known characters. And thats the good thing. Now, we have something other than watching the same old(ahem.. some young) marvel heroes and villains. But still, it feels commercial in making; designed to make money rather than appeal to the genuine movie-watching audience who feel the need to connect to a film before fully appreciating it. But its best for going with buddies on a Friday night. You will enjoy. You will have a sense of satisfaction and you will tell people about it.  "

I kept in mind one thing while watching the movie is that the movie was made in 1977, when there was no technology, no artificial intelligence and automated robots. Movie was brilliantly made and the techniques ( i observed) used to make it visually fascinating are astonishing. Most of the effects are paints and motion blur was used to blend the multiple layers to appear as one. When it comes to the story, i was little bit confused because, the first movie was actually fourth part of the story.

They both have captured maximum space of the screen and they both have captured heart of millions. The directional eye is simply breath taking and the script - so simple yet very powerful.

127440,tt1979320,abhishek2048,india,4,Decent Movie but falls short of greatness,"I went to the screening of Rush with high hopes after what i found were Rave Reviews of the Movie. No Doubt, the movie is decent solid watch, but falls short of being a classic or worthy of an Oscar nomination as claimed by many. Mild Spoilers ahead. As we know by now the story revolves around the rivalry between the Brit James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda with emphasis on the 1976 season. The plot is pretty straight forward and inspired by the true events portrayed authentically. The story moves at decent pace and i also kind of liked the way the season is depicted race by race in a tight gritty manner. Technically the film is good, visually authentic, with decent film editing and good cinematography. However, what seriously limits the film is mediocre dialog, and the lack of an emotional connect to the characters. The women and pretty much the entire cast have precious little to do both in terms of dialog or impact. Chris and Daniel are good in their roles but at some level fail to make us deeply care about them. They do of course have their moments but they are few and far between. If you are an avid F1 fan like me, you d be aware of how, much up to the 70's (hell even 90's till senna's death)F1 was a very dangerous sport with few security regulations, high risk tracks and an indifferent FIA. The film touches on these themes, but alas, fails to draw the kind of emotions/empathy for the drivers. So, all in all a good film which could have been so much more :)  "

Making movies on topics like terrorism, social issues, underworld etc is something we've been doing for decades and we've done great but even imagining such a concept (dreams) is a task in itself leave alone the decision to actually making a movie based on dreams. You watch this movie and with each scene you will say to yourself......yeah..that's how it is....that's how it happens....... Screenplay, direction, script, editing, every thing bloody every thing at its best. Its just not a movie, its more than that. Start to finish I watched this movie with my elbows on my knees and I really don't even remember if I blinked. Wanna watch this movie????

66779,tt1345836,abhishekattri915,india,10,Extraordinary!!!!!!!!!......................................is a small word,"Once again Christopher Nolan outperforms himself. My expectation and imagination seemed too small when I experienced THE DARK KNIGHT RISES today (yeah...first day first show.) Though I was sure Christopher wasn't going to disappoint his audience but I could notice that the audience were overwhelmed. The movie left the people inside the theater relieved and happy as Gothamites were when the nuclear attack was averted and me, I was feeling proud being a Christopher Nolan fan, a BIG one. So what takes this movie multiple notches above than the regular cinema? The answer is ""COMMITMENT"". Chris wasn't up for making a sequel to THE DARK KNIGHT but Warner bros. insisted and he decided to take the production on the floor if only he succeeded to come up with not only good, but the best story for the third installment in the series. This only shows how desperate was he to deliver the best or nothing and that's what exactly happened. Not even a single (mark my words), there not even a single thing in the movie which is gonna bother you or bring your eyebrows closer. Brilliant story, great action, high class drama, matchless costume designing, impeccable editing, world class performance by all the actors (all of them are so much in their characters that you won't see them as Tom Hardy or Anne Hathaway but Bane and Selina,) and superb...I am sorry couldn't come up with a better word...yes SUPERB BACKGROUND SCORE. This is a must watch and definitely a ten out of ten. Christopher should be introduced as a new synonym for the words like Consistent, Superb, Brilliant etc. Don't wait anymore, just go and watch the movie before its off the big screen.  "

I mean come on there is some survival war going on and the best you do is banging over fiery guitar. This movie is as junk as the future shown in the movie. But if you can feel the comedy lying behind the show off you can laugh your ass off. I would have given it 10/10 if the genre mentioned was comedy. This is it. This is the God of comedy.  
66977,tt1345836,abhishekaug1991,india,9,Visionary director,"Filmmakers always keep on trying to keep their films unpredictable. The fact is that a predictable plot always deviates ones attention from the movie. Bt there is also a fact that Christopher Nolan is no ordinary director. And he proves the same once again. There are many sequences in the film that can be predicted, and even then those are also the scenes that will get millions of goosbums over u. Such is the magnitude of the direction of Nolan. Magical is the only word that can describe it. ..........The film is never rushed through. It takes its time to build. Bt the thing is that the thing in which it builds up is ultimate. The thought or the vision that nolan had abt batman has been carried forward to an another level here. Batman, all because of nolan, will now stay in our hearts forever. The last half hour of the film takes you to a crazyy journey of imaginations, twists, visions, emotions and what not. The rise scene, the courtroom scene, the robin concept......Well i feel very small to comment on such a work. Even the acting department is top notch....especially bane(batman).... Though I have some issues with the perfection of the film(some immature errors can clearly be seen...a scene in the rugby stadium where one can notice bane looking at camera for a second)......also the mask on bane never allows his expressions to make an impact(though even then....the rest body language of bane makes a great impact.....bt doesn't allow him to go to the level that Joker set).....bt lets not take anything away from this pure spectacle.....A definite watch....4 on 5  "
25138,tt1375666,abhishek-blogger05,india,10,This film changed my view,"Absolutely excellent movie. I had nothing to do but try Lucid Dreaming myself to taste the idea of Inception. Incredible. Nolan just picked up an idea, an idea which we are very familiar to, but didn't notice in our entire life. Dreaming. I read people's reviews on this website. They are right actually, but i have to say, Nolan has done a wonderful job, we know the rules of dreams and reality, but not everyone knows about it, if it was not explained, the film would've become dull. If he could expand the time of the movie and joined some more interesting parts, it wood be great, but then it could become boring and repeating. He just wanted to plant idea in our mind. And what he did for that is great i think.  "
150791,tt1663202,abhishek-blogger05,india,10,And I thought INCEPTION was the best.,"Inception has been the best film, the character of Mr. Cobb has many similarities with my personal life. No film can take that first place in my list except this film. But, oh boy, Revenant. He just incepted another idea in our minds, that nothing is impossible for this legend. And the whole cast and crew, what a job they've done. There was no way for Oscars to ignore this movie. Maybe there will be more thrilling films in the future, but these ones will remain in our heart. Good stories never get forgotten, only the name of the film gives me enough chills. It's a must watch. When I become a grandpa, my grand kids will be baffled to see these films in my play-list.  "
7150,tt0468569,abhishek-mahe,india,10,The Dark Knight one of the true masterpiece of all time,"Theirs no doubt that the dark knight doesn't deserve an important place with other masterpieces.This is the only film in years to have such an interesting match of action,thriller,good literature,superb direction and of course it has portrayed the common people as heroes. This movie on my perspective is truly inspirational and the other critics should not just see it as a comic character portrayal, rather they should respect this icon and learn how a normal person through strong determination stand up for good.I have watched it hundreds of times and each time i feel rejuvenated to see the interesting contrast of good & the evil which has been brilliantly showcased by bale and late heath ledger. I wish the whole group of Christopher Nolan all the best and hope his direction will surprise everyone of us creating the sequel and break all box office records one again.I do hope the dark knight character will stand tall and deliver what his audiences expect of him.

I was slightly disappointed.. ""THE SCREENPLAY"" of the film is very weak. The story by CHRISTOPHER NOLAN is very good,the concept or you can say the IDEA is refreshing and Interesting but THE PLOT is weak. The DIRECTION of the Film is extremely good.CHRISTOPHER NOLAN handled the movie well, it is griping and exciting to watch at some scenes. TRAILERS of the Film are far more better than the complete film. The best part of the film that I most looked forward to seeing were a little impressive.When Arthur(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) fights against a few gunmen in the hallway of a building while the center of gravity keeps changing. This was a good idea for a fight, but the fight lasts for like a minute. The Cinematography of Wally Pfister is Commendable.HE juxtaposesed the real and the surreal(Dreams) with such finesse, you never do get confused and always remain aware of the slippery ground you are treading on. MUSIC and Background score by Hans Zimmer is coping up with the flow of the movie. But i really miss the INCEPTION THEME-Mind Heist by Zack Hemsey.[:(] the one used in all trailers of film. Overall The movie is GOOD and one time watch but it no where stands as other masterpiece of Nolan like MEMENTO, The PRESTIGE, BATMAN BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT. IF JOHNATHAN NOLAN would have written the SCREENPLAY of the Film then it could have been better than all of the Nolan's Film except THE DARK KNIGHT.. MY RATING-8/10  "

A complete story which stands on its own and makes this movie an epic. I had read somewhere that this trilogy had a theme for every movie. For the first one it was Fear, Second was Chaos and Third is Pain.And I truly believe that Mr.Christopher Nolan has captured these emotions in this trilogy.An Epic end to an Epic journey indeed.Thanks Mr.Nolan for giving us the Batman the way it's supposed to be. I truly recommend not just this movie but the complete trilogy, as after watching these three movies you will know 1.what made Batman 2.What does he stand for 3.what should we remember him for.

107074,tt1291584,abhitaliyan,india,10,Warrior - A Perfect Pugilistic Melodrama,"Numbness because of the sheer emotional tension of the moment is what I felt during the Silent Catharsis of the three lead characters in the culminating scene. Warrior is a two-track drama of fighting and redemption which, in the initial first hour, methodically reveals the back stories and defines the lead characters of the movie with some pummeling thrown in between. The second half showcases the first rate fighting sequences and arousing emotional moments between the lead characters, making it a ""perfect sports movie"" in the process. The movie is about two estranged brothers Brendon & Tommy Conlon (Joel Edgerton & Tom Hardy respectively). Brendon is a beloved high school physics teacher married to his childhood sweetheart Tess (Jennifer Morrison). Tommy is an Iraq war veteran who ran away from home with their mother in his early teens because of their abusive & alcoholic father Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte). Both have a troubled past with their father & neither of them is on well-disposed terms with each other. The movie sets into motion when Tommy returns to his hometown to meet his father after several years. Both brothers were fierce MMA fighters in their teenage, while Tommy learnt MMA boxing under the tutelage of their father, Brendon had his best friend to thank to, who uses Beethoven's Ninth symphony to motivate his fighters. Both the brothers, who now have some financial problems in their lives, decide to take part in a Winner-take-all MMA world championship in Atlanta to put an end to them without the knowledge of each other's participation. What follows next, is the engine of inevitability which leaves both the characters of the movie & audience drained of all the energy. Gavin O'Connor's (""Miracle"" fame) brilliant acumen in the sports genre is visible all over the movie. He along with his co-writers did a terrific job in generating virtually equal sympathy for each brother & coming up with an emotionally & dramatically satisfying climax. Credit must also be given to him for eliciting such powerful performances from his three lead characters. Nick Nolte's heartfelt & audacious portrayal of anguished Paddy is worthy of an Oscar nod of best supporting actor. Fighting scenes are vividly choreographed, complimented by some skillful camera work which makes you twitch during the fights. Commentary during the fight sequences is hilariously inciting, I can watch even the most mundane of sports with that kind of commentary. This is a rare fight movie in which you don't want to see either of them lose, with a climax which can move even some strong men to tears. My Rating: 10/10. http://flickyfriday.wordpress.com/2012/02/09/warrior-2011/  "

49626,tt0103064,abhra_29,india,8,Some of the best movies ever,"A decade after Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) destroyed the original Terminator, a second unstoppable killing machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) arrives from the post-apocalyptic year 2029. But this time his mission is to stop an even deadlier Terminator, the T-1000 (Robert Patrick), made entirely of shape-shifting liquid metal and determined to kill young John Connor (Edward Furlong), the future leader of the human resistance. Sarah, John, and the Terminator counter by going after the scientist responsible for developing Skynet, the computer system fated to destroy humanity, leading to an explosive and spectacular clash with the fate of humanity in the balance. Whereas James Cameron's original THE TERMINATOR was a low-budget marvel of efficiency and speed, TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY is an action-packed blockbuster with some of the most amazing stunts ever filmed and ground-breaking, Academy Award-winning special effects. Star Schwarzenegger was paid in the form of a $15 million dollar jet to revisit his most famous role as the Terminator, this time made kinder and gentler against the silent, relentless T-1000. One of the most popular films of the 1990s, James Cameron's action masterpiece is both a thoughtful look at violence in human nature and an exciting, nonstop thrill ride.  "

659,tt0111161,Abhyuday Singh,india,10,A movie made in a universal language,"This is one of the best movies I've ever watched and it can soothe anyone, relax them to not lose their hope no matter how bad the situation is because it is the best of things. It can move you and can even change you from within bringing to you the thought that not everything in the world needs a reason to be done. Although the main value or 'thing' that this movie promotes is hope, it has lots and lots of other things hidden inside it like humanity, sympathy, addiction and 'institutionalization'. It can be viewed by every other individual in his/her own perspective and be be appreciated in numerous ways. One can always find a new way to cherish it after every view. The acting by everyone is just beyond description. You may forget for a moment that they are actors. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman's performance just phenomenal and completely sucked us in like they were our close ones. In the end, I just want to say that this is a masterpiece and I doubt whether another like this will be created in a long time to come. In my opinion, filmmakers should go back to the origin of Art which is for pleasure and relaxation of mind and soul and stop wasting money on high-budget action flicks which are worthless(I am not saying all) and make films like this one which are a delight to watch and a lot to learn from.

Then i decided it was time--gee, what a good rep the movie has had to this day. However, my early doubts were sound. Hokey accents and ""character bits""---beginning with the waggy headed blonde cashier. So, that dates this movie. Cuz now we know that the Upper Midwest is populated with regular people, who are not painfully cute in their snowsuits. In fact, audiences moved to penguins, who don't even have to wear snowsuits. As time has gone by we have also grasped the range of William (Pleasantville) Macy. He's gone on to better things. But the caricatures and gruesome psychosis juxtaposed with inept human greed and self-centered myopia---ah! it is a diversion. And it is very agreeable to watch Frances McDormand work. The Coens seem to have gone in, done their job and pulled out. A directorial road movie in which the repetitive snowy road goes through mood changes--same road, but the story has altered its meaning. At the end, it's comfortingly familiar. I feel the skeleton of a better movie here.

It's the kind of movie that, honestly, I could type an entire five page thesis on. Inside and out, I had an absolutely wonderful time revisiting characters that, by this point, had become like old friends to me. There are some movies that you just have to admit that your passion for it might be founded completely on bias. I remember my infatuation with Buzz Lightyear as a kid. I remember when Buzz tried to fly out the window but ended up crashing down on Sid's floor. I remember Jessie singing about the days when she used to be loved. Most importantly, I remember that moment at the end of Toy Story 2 when Woody realizes that his place is with the boy that he loves. The first two films, as a whole, are probably some of the most important film memories from my childhood. So coming into Toy Story 3, my expectations were sky-high. It isn't quite as daringly original as some of Pixar's most recent accomplishments (Wall-E, Up, and 'That Rat Movie That I Won't Bother Spelling come to mind), but it doesn't have to be. This is, hopefully, the final curtain for beloved characters that almost every child from my generation has grown up with. It concludes a series of films that together form the best film trilogy this side of The Lord of the Rings. That's no small feat, especially for a bunch of animated pieces of plastic. There's a few hiccups in the narrative from time to time. Occasionally the story felt a little too 'gag heavy' than I would have liked, but this is in the spirit of the original films. Part of what makes Toy Story work so well is that it's able to balance heavy-handed sentimentality with childlike wit and warmth. Some folks could easily walk into this and not pick up on some of the more 'indepth' threads. It functions as both a 'wistful action comedy' and an 'analysis on mortality and aging'. The film's climax is one of the best Pixar has ever pulled off. The entire series comes together in such a bittersweet and satisfying way that it's hard not to shed at least a couple of tears. It's hard to believe that, after all these years, Pixar hasn't managed to lose their touch. I reconnected with my childhood in those last several moments. I really can't ask for anything more than that. It certainly isn't perfect, and there's certainly elements that have been liberally rehashed from the original installments, but Pixar has managed to make the first real animated trilogy. Something to cherish, love, and share with the next generation. Final Verdict: Heart melting. Tears flowing. Wallet eagerly waiting to be emptied for another ticket.  "

I liked the fact that the action started immediately. MAYBE there were some parts (small ones but) that were slightly far-fetched but the result was good with them. The film length was just right not too short, neither long - 1 point in favour. Another thing I liked about the film was that some parts were predictable and others weren't. Also, I think that every action had a purpose and wasn't done just to fill in time. The actors were very good. Johnny Depp was hilarious. So were certain lines. Another good thing about the film was that humour was spread here and there not all in one go. One point against the film was that I wasn't exactly sure why the blood was needed to lift the curse. Either it wasn't specified or else I was too busy admiring Orlando Bloom and missed that part. (For those who haven't seen the film - sorry if I seem vague or senseless but I don't want to give any information on the storyline.) You will find fight scenes galore which I really enjoyed and there's this particular scene when the pirates step in and out of the moonlight which I really loved. Film summary: mixture of pirates, romance, action, magic and luck. By the way, Jonathan Bryce has a very very funny scene and we simply couldn't stop laughing my mum and I. My advice is that this film is definitely worth a try. In fact if I have the chance I would certainly go see it another time. Congrats to all the cast & crew.  "

But Batman just leaving The Joker dangling up there like a puppet wasn't all that great. Yes, the jokes & sarcasm were hilarious but the entertainment was awful. It's rated PG-13 for intense sequences of violence and some menace. The sequences were NOT intense and were most definitely NOT violent. When we see Marvel and movies based on old characters we expect power, fighting and conflicts! But in this movie, where's the power? Fighting? CONFLITCS? Nowhere to be found. So The Joker got arrested, yippee! He escaped and only took ONE life. The scenes with those 2 boats were really unnecessary, having a ferry full of civilians and another full of criminals and both with a remote to blow the other up and are threatened to blow up at midnight. Midnight comes, and everyone is still alive and NONE of the ferries were blown, BIG WHOOP. All in all, the movie SUCKED.

She is perceptive; though she lives half the time in a world of fairies and fauns, she notices the destruction of the world around her. Though her story is compelling, and her imagination darkly fascinating, Ofelia alone did not make this movie great. Instead, what shocked and impressed me the most was the uninhibited way in which it portrayed Franco's Spain. This film is not shy when it comes to violence. If you are in the least bit squeamish when it comes to blood, this would not be a good choice! I found the violence overpowering at times, though it was not gratuitous. On the contrary, having it so present in the film forces the viewer to put themselves truly in the time period, and makes them consider the situation more in depth. It was not a happy time for Spain; death and killing were simply everywhere. The character of the sadistic Captain takes this to extremes, but it comes from all sides, and we can see the pervasive effects of this violence in young Ofelia's thoughts. The film also forced me to assess my personal character. Whenever a film is so deeply real, as this one is, that it brings the viewer into the world in which it is set, it makes me wonder: what side would I be on? In that same situation, what would I do? Am I brave enough to do what we know is right? Difficult questions to answer. For me, Pan's Labyrinth inspired such self reflection. It will blow you away, sicken you, inspire you, and leave you haunted. In all, an excellent dark fairytale that deserved every Academy Award it won.  "

It was a wickedly creative story that fed intelligent viewers nectar of the gods. The Grand Budapest Hotel was a masterfully written story, and without looking at the credits I can say that the director also deserves much of the fanfare. Ralph Fiennes proves he is easily one of the best actors on this planet by his portrayal of Gustav. I don't recall one point in the movie were he wasn't flawless! William DeFoe is easily one of the best ""wingman"" an actor can have. Mr. Abraham did not ""kill Mozart"", and was pleasantly appealing. Casting was great, cinematography was intelligent, art direction delightful, writing superb, production of this was made to look like child's play!

Naturally, each emotion has a distinct colour, shape and personality. I enjoyed the tug of war between the five emotions, and I also enjoyed how two of them go on a road trip in the mind, with core theme islands, train of thought, dreams and subconscious. The animation is an explosion of rainbows and the creativity shown to depict the happenings in the girl's brain is nothing short of amazing, although kids won't understand these ideas. However, it got tedious after awhile and I felt restless. I could feel the audience falling into a rut. Were they as disappointed as I was as to how things were proceeding? Thing started to get worse and I dozed off for a few moments. How did a great animation studio like Pixar fall flat on its face with Inside Out? The idea was remarkable and the presentation was even better, but it failed to grab me by the throat. Read more at: http://abigspark.blogspot.com/2015/08/inside-out-emotionally- drained.html  "

The film introduces a new cast of characters and smartly retains the old cast of Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill. There's enough time for the old and new ones to shine. I liked the fact that director J.J. Abrams chose a multicultural line-up of actors to spearhead the seventh instalment of this franchise. It's nice to see a strong white female upending a bunch of males and showing them that she's got the panache and style to be the face of the new Star Wars. Abrams delivered a coup by picking unknown British actress Daisy Ridley as his lead, Rey, a scavenger who lives from day to day but knows how to take out male fighters in hand-to-hand combat, fly spaceships such as the Millennium Falcon and show the first blush of love with another British newcomer John Boyega. Rey exhibits single-mindedness in her daily tasks yet maintains a youthful ardor and innocence. Watching her in action of simply watching her gaze into the distance is pure bliss. She, like Luke Skywalker (Hamill), doesn't have a family but she says that she's waiting for them to return. Read more at www.abigspark.blogpost.com  "

My expectation was proved true when I watched it. I just never expected it to be filled with dollops of crude humour. The film actually has a soft spot, even though it's littered with profanities and action scenes that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger go green with envy. On the surface, it's about a superhero whose face is so scarred that people in the streets avoid walking near him. Deep down, however, it's about whether his girlfriend can look him in the eye and accept him for who he is. Ryan Reynolds doesn't have a good track record playing superheroes. His Green Lantern (2011) quickly faded into oblivion. He, however, takes a different tack with Deadpool, using his motormouth, instead of his dashing handsomeness, to portray his character's quirks and insecurities.

Only then will you realize more clearly that it is another movie that has pushed many aspects of film-making to their limits. Some scenes are shown in 1.44:1 ratio in IMAX to make your adrenaline rush more effective. Well, catchy special effects are not the only things to look for in this movie, the acting is superb. Everyone gave their best. Heath Ledger is outstanding in the role of the joker. He gave a multi award winning performance. The character joker rocks too. I don't really remember any other villain without any motive, without any plan. The joker really leaves a trail in your mind with his presence, his personality, reflection of his mind, his plans without really planning anything. He makes you think, ""Why so serious?"" Christian Bale is also the best batman so far in my opinion. One thing is for sure, if you haven't watched The Dark Knight you really have missed a real cinema. Go see it in an IMAX theatre and you will never regret it. "

The Acting skills shown in The Godfather 2 by Robert De Niro and AL Pacino are truly something you have to see to believe. Robert De Niro portrayed the character of the young Vito Corleone with such effort that he actually made people believe he was the young Marlon Brando. But AL Pacino even topped De Niro and gave a performance which is one of the few characters to be present on every list of great characters in the film history. AL Pacino's Portrayal of Micheal Corleone was so believable that people forget that they are watching a movie when he was performing. Legendary method actor Lee Strasbourg also made his debut in the film industry with this movie and he proved why he is considered to be such an Icon in the world of Acting.

From The Solid Direction Of Roman Polanski to the Flawless acting of Adrien Brody This Movie without a doubt can be called a Masterpiece. The Movie is based on The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who in the 1930s was considered one of the most accomplished Pianist. But the movie is not about his fame, Nor his Glory as a pianist. It's About A Polish Jew, who fought against all odds, Faced situations that he never even imagined and Finally Survived by losing almost everything and everyone he loved. It shows not only a tale of horrific surviving, but also the emotions that many people had to face and fight in order to live. It makes you wonder how people who really faced and Fought against those odd and lived, makes you ask yourself what would i do in that situation? The Cast is great, Whether it is a important character like Fox as Dorota or Minor character such as Ronan Vibert as Janina's Husband. But Adrian Broody Truly proved his worth as an actor in this film, i mean he was so into the character that he will make you believe that he really is Szpilman, He lost over 14 kilograms and developed a unusual body language for some scenes, and an actor of his level deserve much more recognition, but it's a fact that people nowadays prefer flash and looks over true art, however if you are one of those who can appreciate a true masterpiece you must have a look at ""The Pianist""  "

Orson Welles did an outstanding job directing the movie given the time it was created, he pushed all boundaries of movie making. That is the true reason why Citizen Kane is called the greatest movie of all time by so many people, not for its depth of emotion or performance but for what a breakthrough it really was. All of the Cast did their job well. They were very much in their character, Whether it was important character like Joseph Cotten as Jedidiah or Small character like Ray Collins as Getty's.

""INCEPTION"" was the same thing (but less stupid and more entertaining or at least had more action and violence ) Do not be fooled by the concept; there are just one or two interested statements in this movie but taking three hours for that is excessive. The whole things must make sense in Nolan's depressing mind; the world is ending but people is still selfish enough to make matters worse. The movie has zero humor and the positive or hopeful message is as fake as the special effects. In fact; this is a movie about God; but Nolan's refuse to even refer about religion; so the movie is about ""something"" that is never clear and makes absolutely no sense. ***SPOILER AHEAD*** Without saying too much about the first ending (there is a second happy ending to ensure better box office receipts and is even more absurd ) why whoever could create such a device just pass the message and solve the problem ?. ***END OF SPOILER*** McConaughey is talk is almost incomprehensible. Anne Hathaway is always good; but his character is under written. Jessica Chastain has to deal a completely absurd and unbelievable and over dramatized situations (and she does not succeed).

Whiplash is the story of a drum player trying to succeed with a very extremely perfectionist but sadistic teacher. Did you ever consider drums and important part of a concert ? Yes; they are there but usually just as an accompanying instrument. Aside from STOMP; I really never care about a drum solo concert. Well, this movie will prove you wrong. There are moments in this picture you will hold your breath for the length of the scene; and some bloody moments will make you look elsewhere; but it is not an horror movie; is just a story of fighting your own frustration for some and for others about the God complex. J.K. Simmons is outstanding as Fletcher; the narcissistic and sadistic teacher; but Teller is also excellent as a mediocre person trying to get some kind of triumph in something.

When I tried to talk to his supervisor, I questioned and humiliated like a common criminal in the City Hall office. The conclusion of the discussion was ""WE WONT BE TALKING ANY MORE WITH YOU, PLEASE LEAVE"". I remember that before September 11th five years ago, USA was the FREEDOM country. But, after the tragic events, government officials (police and civil servants) had been, invoking our security, abusing of their power and mistreated citizens and all of us had been closing our mouths and humbled. Now, five years after and for the first time a movie dare to talk about the abuse on the people and it does in a really very fearless way.

Now that the American government is being questioned about everything that happened in recent years this movie comes with another theory about everything. The story does not happens in the USA (neither was the comic), but the events depicted are easily related. There was a huge massacre attributed to the Muslim terrorist and a Chancellor using that to become a ""DEMOCRATIC DICTATOR"". The movie clearly suggests government intervention on terrorism blamed events. Other current events are shown. The use of ""FOR YOUR SAFETY"" propaganda and the abuse of lies in the media in order to keep the people frightened and accept every possible abuse. Did I mention corruption on the highest government levels, tortures and people kidnapping? Due to its strong political subject, ""V FOR VENDETTA"" is a must see movie which does not means is really a great movie. The rhythm is uneven; there is far more talk than action (probably because the great Hugo Weaving never take out the mask) and many implausibilities (like Portman's torture).

Abrams will defend is similar items as an homage to the original; but in my opinion this is just recycling and not particularly original. Ignoring this few similarities; lets focus on the new things: 1-The main Jedi character is a girl called Rey (Daisy Ridley is OK but still too green to carry a movie by herself). Besides her character is even more childish and very little defined. Luke which at least has a motivation for fighting. 2-Hans Solo is replace by a black guy (I do not think he is African American since this is outer space) who instead of being an scumbag is a troop deserter (John Boyega; really very good and capable of getting a few good laugh); but is still not interesting enough to carry the movie. 3-R2D2 has been replace by BB-8; very cute and digitally enhanced to be almost alive; but it does not even come closer to the personality Lucas infuse in the R2D2 coupled with C3PO 4-Christoper Lee was replaced by Domhnall Gleeson; something I rather erase from my mind. 5-Joda is replace by something like a Chinese woman with a lot of cheap philosophical statements (like the Light Sable is calling his master). (Joda was not in the original Star Wars but somehow is the most remembered character). On the plus side; there is more humor than the original; and the action scenes and environments are more impressive; considering it cost perhaps 50 times more than the original and there were huge digital advances in the last 38 years; the achievement is not impressive.

A new editor (himself Jewish) wants to uncover those cases and obviously recover lost sales in a publication that was not on its best days. The movie tries to be ALL THE PRESIDENT MEN; by trying to create a big political statement on something that is not really political and was more a consequence of bad and greedy lawyers, lazy periodism and police and a justice system apparently too light in that kind of issues. One of the good things about this movie is that shows were the problem lies; however as in any propaganda project; the target is clear and the attack on the Catholic church is continuous even when most of the things does not really justify it. The whole movie is basically lots of feverish discussions between journalist that seems to feel they are saving humanity a few tales of witness of evenths occurred years ago that as memory fails can not 100% trusted., It is very difficult to keep interest in a movie based on long feverish arguments (between the journalists) who seems to believe they are saving the world (according to them never even sleeping ) a very few witness or victims statements that after many years could not be considered 100% reliables. Even the acting is forced and not convincing. The only one I really like was Liv Schreiver (as the Jewish editor) who orders the investigation but whose motives and agenda are not very clear. I will not negate I was raised catholic; but having studied in a Catholic school in Argentina spend my young years with religious associations like Catholic Action and been surrounded by priests until almost eighteen; I never witness or heard anything remotely close to child molesting in that environment. However we discussed with priest and functionaries about old terrible mistakes of the Catholic church like Holy Cruzades or strong physical punishment in schools. There was a simple explanation; Church grows and learn (albeit slowly) as times changes. It is not good; but it was created by humans and make mistakes. If the intention is accusing Catholic church members based on certain certain events; then we have to accuse the school system based on the recent case of child abuse by an assistant coach in very well known USA school and covered by a very respected head coach. Perhaps we must accuse the Army of rapist; (as recent denounces that the military tried to cover based on military laws; or other religions like the Jewish who still maintain certain traditions that out of their community should be considered abusive for child; but we are never supposed to criticize Jewish because we are immediately accused of racism (which does not happens with other religions or races). In brief; SPOTLIGHT is basically a bad propaganda movie with the intention on dividing Catholic church and diminishing its power.

The story is pretty much the same but told in much more bearable way (the original Richard Harris spent 90% of the movie alone). But are the images and effects that stand out; created by using wide angle lenses on close ups and moving the camera on 360 degrees; creating immersive images that easily transmit to other senses.

It required very humble and committed actors to accept these roles. Tom Hardy is terrifying in a character that pure selfishness and not allow a hint of sympathy. Di Caprio in his most physical interpretation until today is outstanding. You are able to feel his pain and suffering.

When I heard about DEADPOOL; perhaps the funnier character in Wolverine; played by Ryan Reynolds a guy who can take sarcasm to the next level and without the constrains of the PG-13 rating; I decided to give the movie an opportunity and I was not disappointed. Without the limitations of kids oriented movies (but still restrained in my opinion); DEADPOOL can say and show things any other movie of this kind would not dare. There is some nudity (nothing erotic), a sex scene (not too erotic either but played for laughs), strong bloody violence and continuous F-bombs and cruel one-liners that might not be appropriate for kids (I doubt many kids will understand most of the jokes). Could the movie have been better; perhaps a more developed villain could have helped (however this is the kind of movie where the main character is interesting) or perhaps less restraint in images side not only the verbals. MARVEL's made a bet with this movie; but it was not huge one. The production values are fine but there is no extra money for cameo or big names (Reynolds break the fourth wall a few times and joke about the money constrains). In brief; it is the funniest Marvel yet and really deserves a public with brains)  "
67377,tt1345836,abisio,united states,3,Bore-man rises,"Quick short comment; DARK KNIGHT RISES is boring, the action scenes are not interesting and the plot is absurd. Acting is fine but some dialogues are unintelligible. Now; let's expand: - At almost three hours, this movie pace is terrible. - Action scenes are very spaced but not spectacular (aside from a few mass movements the rest is pretty rudimentary). Even the airplane highjack, publicized as made without digital effects, does not look that impressive. - Most of the actors deliver; but trying to understand Michael Caine long diatribes or even Tom Hardy behind Bane's mask requires a lot of effort. - There are outstanding performances like Gary Oldman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the real heroes and most developed characters. Anne Hathaway gets easily away with the treacherous CAT WOMAN and Marion Cotillard completely take over the screen when she is in it. Last, the plot; even fantasy requires a logic; but this is not the case here. In order to justify the revolution and kaos, Nolan created a series of unrealistic events: - A respected senator, gives up everything after a few hours of meeting CAT WOMAN; and an army of SWAT teams, appears in a matter of seconds after someone use the senator's phone. - A computer scam puts a billionaire in state of bankruptcy in a matter of hours; causing even his car to be repossessed - Why taking over Wayne's company when Bane knows everything about everything; even BATMAN's identity. - The newcomer Blake, knows BATMAN identity; but the police chief has no hint at all (even when he ask somebody to contact Bruce Wayne about BATMAN). - What is logic on taking over a city to be blown up three months later? . Besides; what GOTHAN has to do with the personal vendetta behind all this ?. It is not the first time, Goyer's writing breaks logic just to justify some event and Nolan did the same in INCEPTION making the last act absurd; but this time the went as far as breaking almost every possible logic just to make the movie darker and force twists. It is even worse (or lame) that following up on the previous movie; they insist on stating that real facts should be hidden for the common people and the creation of FAKE IDOLS (heroes) are necessary to keep society controlled (a very fascist concept also used by Stalin ).

19380,tt0120737,ablbodyed,united states,10,What a thrilling experience," I just loved this movie. The effects were stunning, the scenery magnificent, and the art direction astonishing. What can one say about the story? It's exciting, SCARY, and emotional. I can hardly wait for the next one. Canny of the producers to make us wait.  "
14023,tt0167260,ableape,united states,10,Biased by the book," It is difficult to not be biased when reviewing films like Lord of the Rings, especially since the source material has been so popular for so long. Having just finished reading the last page of the volumous book a few days prior, I was anxious and prepared to see Peter Jackson's last take on the third book, Return of the King. Even considering my high expectations, I was still blown away. It seems he has saved the best for last. Not only did I feast my eyes on the sweetest visual candy, I was taken on an intensely emotional rollercoaster. While the second film may have seemed slower-paced than the first, this third film is faster, and ultimately more exciting than the first or second, even given its 3+ hours run time. But it could also be a bit draining. Not that that's a bad thing. Just be prepared. The film opens with a flashback that gives Andy Serkis (Gollum/Smeagol) a chance to develop his character as well as appear without computer enhancement. But once the computer graphics are kicked in, they give life like some supreme being. (Upon first seeing Gollum again, I actually believed he was real for a moment. An improvement over last year's award-winning model, and money well spent.) Throughout the movie, many others are given chances to deliver classic lines and develop their characters further, and they do it superbly. We even get to hear Pippin (Billy Boyd) sing, surprisingly with a beautiful voice, as well as Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen). The sheer scale of the computer-generated armies are jaw-dropping. Battle scenes are plentiful and satisfying, including a sequence with Legolas and an Oliphaunt that is particularly rousing. However, Aragorn's ghost army seemed a bit unnatural (excuse the pun), but maybe that was the intent. Since this isn't Jackson's first experience with ghosts, one might expect better. One of his earlier films, ""The Frighteners"", expertly blended true horror with true humor, a feat most people fail to recognize, let alone duplicate. To point out another possibly minor flaw, Denethor's odd behavior goes a bit unjustified in the film. Yes, he just found out about his favorite son Boromir's death, but it's still puzzling that some seemingly minor scenes and dialogues were included, yet the ""real"" (book) reason why he was so wacked in the head was not even eluded to. Granted, having to cram and wrap up multiple major plot lines built up during two previous movies is valiant, if not impossible, so Jackson's artistic liberties with the book are excusable when necessary. (For example, there is no appearance of Saruman, and the Shire remains unscoured.) Perhaps the Special Extended Edition DVD will expound upon this, and other unanswered questions. In the end, men cheered and women cried. Overall, a highly enjoyable ride. If this doesn't sweep the awards, it'll at least sweep you off your feet. 9.5 out of 10.   "
28155,tt0167261,ableape,united states,10,Won't spoil the fun (or story),"We showed up at 5:00 for the 5:30 showing and the rest of the shows were already sold out for the night. Fortunately, I had purchased our tickets online last week (at the matin«∏e prices, no less). After sitting in the third row, center, we were shown ads for drivel such as Legally Blonde 2 and Dumb & Dumber 2 (titled Dumb & Dumberer). This is their target audience? Shrugging off the insult to my intelligence, I was treated to the visual and intellectual ride of my theater-going life. The first few minutes are simply INTENSE, and will make you want more, which the final hour of the 3-hour tour provides. I will try not to reveal or spoil too much for those not finished with the books yet. Let me first say that Peter Jackson has skillfully remained faithful to the books, but yet still created his own version of the story by taking creative license when he deemed necessary. Some events are invented, rearranged, or removed, but it is easily apparent when taking into consideration the task at hand. My overall impression is that what may have gone overlooked in the books is highlighted enough to show emphasis, yet not overemphasized as to feel insulted. The movie handles most of the second book, ending way before the ""other side of the mountain"" is even reached. It made sense to be a good place to pause the story, since the main climaxes had just happened (Helm's Deep, and Isengard). Gollum is featured prominently (and almost repulsively), and Faramir's roll is enhanced a little. There is also more emphasis on Arwen & Aragorn's relationship, too, but that's for the chicks, I think. Aragorn has a large roll throughout. The special effects are, again, intense. The 10,000 computer-generated orcs are quite convincing. My trained and critical eye had a hard time finding any flaws, and I think I only found one (I could be wrong). If anything, the battle scenes seemed a bit too flashy, and by that I mean the action zipped by the screen so fast that I could hardly tell what was happening. Truly a candidate for next-gen video game youngsters on speed with slo-mo remotes. (Or am I just getting old?) Otherwise, superb. And the cinematography is, well, how can anyone take a bad picture of New Zealand? Spectacular. Even the musical score seemed improved (and note that Enya does not contribute to the soundtrack this time). Everyone's acting is nothing less than excellent. Gimli the Dwarf plays a large part in providing comic relief, almost unexpectedly sometimes, which truthfully I thought the books lacked. Again, here is but one of the many examples where the film provides what seems like added ""bonus"" material to the books, without leaving you feeling disappointed about what they left out or changed. Overall, I rate this film a carefully weighed 10, which is a grade not readily handed out in my book.  "
61354,tt0405094,ablewisinithaca,united states,10,Perfect,"This is one of the finest films ever made. It has the depth and the emotional intensity usually only found in great literature. To the best of my knowledge it captures the hapless idealism and the cynical thuggishness of East Germany's ""really existing socialism"" in a perfectly contained story resolved in a perfectly human way. After I saw it, a friend asked me how I would compare it to other films I had seen, and I honestly could not think about any other films. I could remember titles of course, but my mind was filled by this one. It is a masterpiece of understatement and rewards the attentive viewer completely.  "

And the prospect of watching it didn't sound too appealing to me at first, considering the rather subdued DVD case cover...(I know, I'm ashamed) That said, this film is a masterpiece of story telling, the calibre of which my current favourite films pale in comparison. I don't think I've ever been more moved by any other films, period!!! I've vowed never to see this film again, as I think revisiting it would lessen the emotional impact of the first viewing. In any case I don't think I need to re-watch it as it's been burned into my memory forever. This is a film that I hate and love at the same time. The beautiful story and the capturing of facial expressions which only a hand drawn animation could fully realise. On the other hand the film reduced me to sobbing wreck, a bitter sweet ending which left me so depressed it took me another two days to get over... Its a must see, but be sure to have lots of tissue paper on hand. I'm temped to say it's a life changing experience, certainly has been for me. The rest I leave to you to decide.  "

67504,tt1345836,Abolaji Alausa,nigeria,6,"The Dark Knight Rises, then plummets.","SPOILER ALERT!!! I completely loved the music. Hans Zimmer masterfully merged the original score with the prisoners' chant to create a terrifying yet unique sound that carried the movie along. I could not keep the drums out of my head till the next morning. The daring opening sequence, the midair plane hijack/kidnapping/staged-accident was cleverly pulled off and set the tone for the rest of the action sequence in the movie. Batman's first appearance in costume after a prolonged absence was grand also; the auto-adjust wheels of the bikes were particularly cool. That said, I must confess that I am a very angry fan. Mainly because I have read and drawn the Dark Knight since I can remember, partly because Mr Nolan, director of The Prestige really was the best man for the job, but I'm afraid the job was not well done. Even more disappointing is that David Goyer, writer of the Blade Trilogy, writer of the Dark Knight trilogy, an all around 'comic-head' whose body of work singularly contains the most superhero blockbusters by one single writer/producer/director failed woefully. HOW CAN YOU RETELL 'KNIGHTFALL' WITHOUT A MEMORABLE FIGHT SCENE!!! Without one of the greatest martial artist in the comic world putting up a worthy performance, without Bane resorting to doping just to even the odds, without all of the images of Neo Versus Agent Smith scorchingly burnt out of my mind forever? Why do I keep seeing Kelley Jones' cover of the pivotal story arc? Did Nolan and his team even reference the source material? Did they see Batman's scale to Bane's? Did they see how majestic his built was? Tom Hardy's delivery was 'Broadway' flawless, but I swear I saw something bothering on a potbelly in Bane's second appearance. The amount of time wasted on monologues, Alfred, played by Sir Michael Caine, constantly defying Bruce Wayne almost to the point of irritation. John Blake played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, a rookie cop who smartly reveals Bruce's identity to his face in yet another protracted and confusing monologue. All of this time would have been well spent in the hands of a good fight choreographer. Catwoman, played by Anne Hathaway was a sight to behold, although all of her would-be memorable moves were shot too close up robbing her of a befitting place with Scarlett Johansson and Carri-Anne Moss as the baddest babes in spandex. I have heard of lips pouting, but I swear that's what her derri«˘re did when she mounted Batman's bike. Memorable lines? Don't hold your breath, as Bane and Scarecrow delivered some jaw dropping clich«∏s, and that is when one manages to make out Bane's words through his overly enhanced-bionic-English accent, and yes, Batman still whispers. There was sadly a feeling of overcrowding, if that term can be used for a $250m blockbuster, and I don't mean the thousands of extras that Mr Nolan had to hire, but apart from the top-billed cast, the amount of known faces popping up and disappearing before completing their sentences were just too much to take in. From Liam Neeson returning as an imaginary Ra's al Ghul, to Reggie Lee playing the subterranean hero cop, to Tomas Arana, who played Quintus in Gladiator, being on screen for less than two minutes. The casting wasn't the only thing on a grand scale; the story itself was of epic proportions. The tension was palpable, the reality was very American. The team pulled off the Gotham siege and made invading aliens seem like child's play albeit with a few holes in the plot, some that even my suspension of disbelief could not handle. At the end of the day, no memorable hand-to-hand fight scene, no hi-five gone wrong, no mutant bashing a God's head into the concrete. No memorable lines, no memorable moves, even Bane's defeat was left hanging unpleasantly. My candid opinion, Nolan overplayed his hand with the vulnerable Batman thing. The greatest detective on earth did not have an inkling of what he was up against, the greatest martial artist in DC universe did not last a complete 10 minutes against a Bane without his venom. That broke the movie for me.  "
74666,tt0022100,Abolla,united kingdom,8,A subtle warning against Nazism and an excellent Thriller,"Fritz Lang's classic M still acts as a milestone for films today; his use of mise-en-scene and editing is remarkable by any standard. In a scene where the gang lords and city authorities are discussing what to do about Peter Lorre's character, their complete blindness to the situation is displayed through the rooms being smothered in cigarette smoke, like a smokescreen. Quality stuff. This scene is also cross-cut between the two parties to show how similar they are and of course not to bore the audience. The link to Nazism comes at its strongest at the trial scene. Here the character Schrenker shrieks down at Hans Beckart using words like ""extinguished"" and ""obliterated"" that only Hitler would use when accusing the Nazi enemies at trial. The film was banned in Germany (1934) after it was made and later both Peter Lorre and Fritz Lang fled Germany to America for their Jewish faith before the Nazis came into power. One shot that is quite baffling is an undignified view of Lohmann from underneath a desk. What a weird idea, but it watching afterwards the reason for the shot comes true when we find out that Lohmann thinks he has all the knowledge about the reasons for the bank raid. He then open-mouthed drops his cigar when he finds out he was on the complete wrong track. Makes perfect sense. 8/10  "

Why do I think this is the greatest film of all time? (a) The plot is solid (b) The cinematography is eye candy (c) Not one hesitation in action. As I am watching the film I notice that every action sequence was original and therefore copied by every action film after 1959. Cary Grant dominates every seen. The dialog is brilliantly written and it's safe to say, no action film will ever come close to topping North by Northwest.  "

This may be a comic book movie but its definitely for adults. Every actor in this movie was fantastic, i especially enjoyed Elijah Woods. His character is disturbing in a way that will stop you from blinking, you cant stop watching the screen. When you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about. Everyone needs a dog like the one Elijah's character has. This movie is true writing, its true to the characters presented and there is never a crappy Hollywood cheese moment.

35596,tt0102926,aboyer1,united states,10,Truly Suspenseful and Amazing,"Silence of the Lambs is a true work of art. It stands as my favorite film not only in the thriller/suspense genre, but of all films in existence. The story is original and never goes stale, all of the characters are interesting, the dialogue between the bright, young Clarice Starling and the maniacal, manipulative Hannibal Lecter is phenomenal. Hannibal Lecter is one of the most terrifying characters in film due to his extreme intelligence and disturbing habits. The camera work in this movie is also outstanding, especially toward the climax of the film, when the florist is ringing the doorbell; that's all I will say as to not give it away, but it throws you for a loop. Who can forget the eery ""Goodbye Horses"" tune with the infamous dance? The climax will have you on the edge of your seat, just waiting to jump. The film is puzzling, intense, suspenseful, anything you could ask for in a thriller. The film is mesmerizing and has yet to be beaten by any other film as my top choice.  "
43954,tt0816692,abr5,united states,7,Skin-deep masterpiece,"Hats off to this film for bringing a beautiful blend of different elements to life. The gritty open spaces of the midwest (a nod to the origins of many of the real world NASA astronauts of the 60's and 70's), the awe-inspiring vistas, thunder, and silences involved in escaping our planet on the tips of rockets, the incredible daring and adventure involved in going further. The soundtrack blending perfectly with the imagery at every turn, heightening the experience. But all of this focus on atmospherics came at the price of second rate plot and science elements. _2001_ remains the only major example where first rate science fiction talent worked with first rate film talent, and the result relegates films like _Interstellar_ and _Prometheus_ to a second tier. These ""B+"" films are masterful works on the surface, but do not stand scratching or digging below. Arthur C. Clarke and Stanley Kubrick went back and forth for months working on the script for _2001_. Clarke created it for the screen -- it was not based on trying to adapt a novel. He rewrote the majority of it several times as the demands of film were brought together with the realities of the projected trajectory of science. In _Interstellar_, by contrast, premise after unreasonable premise must be ignored by the viewer in order to enjoy the story. Just a few examples. How are things going to be any easier growing crops on another planet if we can't get it fixed on earth? Why are all of these probes able to send only vague data about ""presence of organics"" without even any timestamps while the next ship with only 10 years later technology can send video communications? How did they determine all of these planets to go to in the first place? Why send only one person to each to be driven crazy by loneliness? Why on earth would landing on the time-zoomed planet even be considered? Why do they need a massive rocket to get off earth but fly off in a Star Wars-like winged lander from a planet with 1.3x earth's gravity? How are giant waves propagating in 8 inches of water? It just goes on and on. It's depressing that with all the millions spent on making this movie they couldn't spare the time and the resources to put thought into the story. It seems like they just gave up and figured they couldn't make the entertaining, beautiful vision they wanted while keeping the science and the story believable at the same time. But _2001_ proved that wrong 46 years ago (!), and they should have aimed higher. All of that said, if you're into SF it's a better film than 90% of the stuff coming out, and benefits greatly from the big screen experience, so go see it!  "
117681,tt2488496,abr5,united states,3,Recycled Retreading Relived Remake,"I've always been in the minority that liked I-III. Sure there were the gaffs like Jar-Jar, but on the whole they had a fascinating story to tell and didn't retread over old ground. You can quibble about how the tale of the Jedi, the origins of the Empire, the Storm Troopers, and the Emperor were told, but it was interesting to see all of this fleshed out. And the development of Annakin Skywalker was well conceived and far more believable than I suspect many of the critics could make it if they had a pen, paper, and a hundred years to write. And, now that I've seen Episode VII, I can confidently say that the best is behind us. Clearly inspiration was gone and the only thought put into producing this movie was to how to remix tried and true formulas in a different enough way that it could be sold as a new episode rather than a remake. I won't bother with the gory details of all the parallels, which would only serve to label this review as containing spoilers and to decrease the internal stability in my digestive tract. Element after element was shamelessly copied from Episode IV. Apparently the idea was not to give the generation that grew up with the originals something more, but to give the latest generation a Star Wars of its own, relying on the elements that Lucas's genius put together the first time around to work again. And, unsurprisingly, they do. Behold the average rating of the movie, nearly as high as the original. And given the harsh critical response all around to Episodes I-III, who can blame them? Clearly ingenious storywriting, beautiful special effects, and bold venturing into new narrative territory were not rewarded in the modern cinema marketplace. What's going to rake in the money is tired repetition of the same formulas, perhaps with a few more explosions per minute added in.  "

I have a friend who can sound just like Gollum, although he is no match for Andy Serkis. ***WARNING!!! MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE!!*** Frodo Baggins is nearing the end of his journey to destroy the evil Ring, along with Sam and Gollum. We find that, after ""leaving"" Smeagol in TTT, Gollum apparently is back in ROTK. He talks to himself a lot, and has an evil plan of getting rid of Sam. He poisons Frodo's mind, and Frodo sends Sam away. Later, however, Sam returns and injures Shelob, the humongous spider that lived in the cave that Gollum sent Frodo in. Later, it's Gollum, not Frodo, who destroys the Ring. Gollum, of course dies in the process. Sauron is destroyed as well. The explosion of his tower is excellent. The final battles, the acting, the music, and everything else in this movie is 100% perfect. My score: 10/10  "

Fantastic! I loved the prologue, the music, the sword battles. I also loved the fact that the director made it so, when an arm or head was cut off, nothing gushed out. He also followed the book very well, although I didn't read the book until after the third movie came out. The cast was perfect. I don't see how anyone wouldn't like this trilogy.

This has so many graphics and special effects, it's hard to know where to begin. **Minor spoiler ahead.** I like the part when you see a flashback, to when before Boromir was killed. You see that Boromir and Faramir were the best of friends, and their father, who wasn't very nice to Faramir, seemed to only love Boromir. After Boromir is killed, Dethomir blames Faramir. But Faramir only does what he feels is right. (Except for the time where he took Frodo and Sam to Gondor.) Not only is this a terrific movie, but it could not have been better. It may be too long for some people, but it it not too long to me. I think it is amazing that the two actors who played Boromir and Faramir have a certain resemblance. It is only 3 hours and 43 minutes long, and there's at least a half hour alone on the credits. If you like the first movie, you won't be disappointed in this movie. My Score: 10/10.  "
33605,tt0076759,abrafocus,united states,7,One of the Best in the saga,"This was the first Star Wars movie that I ever saw. I first saw it back in 1990. (I think)I was only 6 at the time; I really didn't understand the meaning of the story. Now that I'm 21, I understand it perfectly. As I said in the comment I made about Episode VI, the three main characters were portrayed perfectly. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher played Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Princess Leia, respectively. Only those three actors could have played the roles. As for Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, he did well. I hadn't heard of Alec Guiness until this movie, nor had i seen any of his movies. **Minor spoilers ahead** I loved the final battle of the Death Star, though the death of Obi-Wan made me a bit queasy. I also noticed, now that I've seen all 6 movies, Yoda is not in this movie. He appears in the other 5, but is not in this one at all. My Score: 7.5/10.  "
36562,tt0038650,abrafocus,united states,10,My All Time Favorite Movie!!,"***Warning!!! Spoilers are ahead!!!! Do not read if you have not seen this movie!!!*** James Stewart plays a banker named George Bailey. The main part of the movie is a flashback, where we see the main part of his early life. We see him grow up from a small boy of 12 to when he's in his 40's. James Stewart is the best actor who has ever lived. This is my opinion, and you can have yours, but I still LOVE this movie, even though I only watch it 2 times a year at the most. I would watch it every day if I could. If you love Jimmy Stewart, you will love this movie. SHAME on all those who don't like this movie. It has zero profanity, zero inappropriate scenes, and ZERO violence. This kind of movie is appropriate for ALL ages. It is pretty sad that this kind of movie can rarely be found being made today. Watch this movie. You WON'T regret it! : )  "
46861,tt0082971,abrafocus,united states,8,Great action!,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies! It's not currently on my Top 30 list, but it's pretty darn close. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, a science teacher who goes exploring for ancient artifacts in different parts of the world. **Spoilers** After failing to retrieve an ancient idol, he goes to Nepal to retrieve an important piece that will help him stop the Nazi's from getting the Lost Ark, an artifact that the Israelites had hidden in a big underground room. I won't give away any more spoilers, in case there's someone out there who likes to read spoilers. I'll just say one more thing: It's a great movie, but children age 8 and under should not be allowed to watch this movie; they may have nightmares about it for months afterward. My Score: 8/10.  "
49234,tt0047396,abrafocus,united states,9,Great suspense film,"In one of James Stewart's best films, he plays L. B. Jefferies, a photographer with a broken leg. The broken leg was due to an accident several weeks before: He had gone out in front of a car racer, and it ran over him. It actually didn't run over him, it just hurt him a lot. Since he's confined to a wheelchair for a while, Jefferies has time on his hands. He looks across the street and sees a suspicious man acting very strange. He uses binoculars to spy on this man, whom Jeffries strongly suspects of murder. If you feel like watching a good suspense movie, this is the one to see. This is one of Hitchcocks's best movies, and it get's a 9/10 from me.  "
58862,tt0110357,abrafocus,united states,10,The Lion King,"When I first watched The Lion King, I had mixed feelings about it. I've never been a fan of Elton John, and his songs are less than impressive. In this film, however, since he wasn't the one singing, I enjoyed them very much. I especially liked the songs, ""I Just can't Wait to be King,"" and ""Hakuna Matata."" (Next sentence is a spoiler.) I also enjoyed Pumbaa and Timon's karate action at Pride Rock. The voice cast is amazing. Jonathan Taylor Thomas as young Simba, Matthew Broderick as adult Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar; Nathan Lane as Timon, Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa, James Earl Jones as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. The three hyena, Bezaai, Shenzi, and Ed were voiced by Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg and Jim Cummings, respectively. The Lion King is a great movie, and is well worth your time. My Score: 10/10.  "
74185,tt0086190,abrafocus,united states,9,Star Wars Episode 6 - The final film of the great saga,"Many weeks ago, I had this film listed on my Top 30 at #6. Now, for some reason unknown even to me, it has fallen to the bottom 10. Now it is #24. The acting was great. The story was great. But it was not directed by George Lucas, and that is not great. Mark Hamill, and only Mark Hamill, could have played the part of Luke Skywalker. ***Spoilers ahead*** Overall, this movie was done pretty well. It lost a point due to the fact that it had no real central plot. Unless you count the Rebels destroying the Death Star, and Darth Vader betraying the Emperor (finally) and destroying him in the process. While done well, it could definitely been a lot better. My Score: 8/10.  "
85518,tt0114709,abrafocus,united states,9,Great film about toys,"Toy Story is the first fully computer-animated film. It tells the story of a cowboy toy named Woody (voice of Tom Hanks) who is jealous when a new toy arrives, Buzz Lightyear (voice of Tim Allen). Buzz thinks he's a space ranger, and is eventually ""disposed of"" accidentally by Woody. (Woody had only meant to knock Buzz behind a dresser) Woody and Buzz eventually become friends, and had it not been for that friendship, Buzz would have been . . well, I'll let you see it yourself. Toy Story, while a great film, is the only Pixar to not be among my Top 10. But still, I think it's worth watching. It may not be log enough, but not all good movies have to be 2-3 hours long. My Score: 9/10  "
86587,tt0045152,abrafocus,united states,6,Some of the songs are corny.,"This is one of the best and worst musical movies made. The performances of Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds was great, but I was semi-disappointed in some of the songs. I really didn't like the ""Gotta Dance"" video thing, and the woman who tosses the coin over and over, that was really corny. On the other hand, the song that\'s called, ""Make 'em laugh!"" was really good. Especially when Cosmo crashed through the wall. The Lima thing sounded rally psycho. Her voice made me want to cringe. But I guess that's how Jean Hagen's character spoke. Good movie. But only watch it if you really like any of the three main actors. My Score: 6/10.  "
90900,tt0097576,abrafocus,united states,6,Not as good as Raiders,"This movie was okay, but it wasn't as good as the first movie. There's one good reason I don't like this one as much as Raiders, and that's the fact that Harrison Ford uses a profanity term that I find very objectionable. I won't say it here, but if you want to record it off the TV, and you know where to look, I recommend pausing the recorder at the moment he uses the term. Sean Connery is Jones's father, and his father is kidnapped, and taken to some foreign country. Indy goes to find him, bringing with him a diary that his father sent him. This was a big mistake. It was also a mistake to trust anyone. He was told by his friend, Walter Donavan, to not trust anyone. **End spoilers** No more spoilers from here on. I'll just say it's a good movie, but eight-and-under's should not watch it. It's much too intense. My score: 6/10.  "
102347,tt0050212,abrafocus,united states,7,Pretty Good,"I've seen this movie only once, and that was a long time ago. Since I was a fan of Alec Guiness, I looked forward to seeing this movie. I was not disappointed. His performance gave him the Oscar he won. He did magnificently, and I strongly recommend this movie for people who like good war movies. British World War 2 prisoners of war are given the task, by their Japanese captors, of building a railway bridge in an Asian jungle. Led by Col Nicholson, (Guiness)a British officer, the prisoners score a moral victory over the Japanese by not only building the bridge, but running the whole show. Unknown to Nicholson, an allied demolition team are planning to destroy the bridge once it's completed. A great war film. 7/10.  "
114787,tt0266543,abrafocus,united states,10,Finding Nemo: A great classic film!,"I loved Finding Nemo from the very beginning. The young voices are cute, especially Nemo and Squirt. ""Finding Nemo"" is a fun-loving, wonderfully animated movie that won the Best Animated Film of 2003. **Spoilers ahead** Nemo is a young clown fish, who's father, Marlin is overprotective of him. He has a good reason, to be overprotective, though. Not long before Nemo was born, his wife, Coral and most of their children, still in their eggs, were swiped by a mean-looking barracuda. Later, Nemo meets Gill, Peach, and the rest the of the ""Tank Gang."" Marlin eventually finds Nemo, but never would have if not for the help of Dory, who suffers from short-term memory loss. She helps him, and she refers to Nemo by several names: Harpo, (Marx) Elmo, (Sesame Street character) and others. ""Finding Nemo"" is #2 on my all-time favorite movie list, second only to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" Watch ""Finding Nemo"" and you won't regret it!  "
133564,tt0052618,abrafocus,united states,9,Pefect movie . . . almost,"I really can't think of any flaws in this movie, as I haven't seen it for years,but I do remember the brilliant performance of Oscar Winner Charlton Heston (The Ten Commandments). He meets an old friend, and his friend, Quinton Arrius, invites him to do something that Ben-Hur refuses to do. I don't remember what the offer involved, but it was not something good. Soon, they separate, and become bitter enemies. Circumstances lead Ben-Hur and Arrius to a great chariot race, and while Ben-Hur's mother and two sisters have leprosy, Ben-Hur prepares for the great race. Arrius, unfortunately, is cheating. His chariot has sharp spikes attached to the wheels, and, while moving, when it touched another moving chariot, it would cut into the wheel and disable the chariot. Ben-Hur, of course wins the race, and Arrius is badly injured. Before he dies, he tells Ben-Hur about his family. Ben-Hur finds his mother and two sisters, and they are later healed by Jesus, before he is crucified. This is a great movie, and I highly recommend it for people who love action movies. My Score: 9/10.  "
135677,tt0093779,abrafocus,united states,7,Good action movie,"***There is a minor spoiler below** First I want to say that I DO NOT hate this movie. I gave a ""7"" because there are a few things in this film that I strongly object to. 1. Inigo using the ""S"" ""O"" ""B"" term. (right before he kills Count Rogan.) 2. The grandson using a word in the wrong way. (When he finds out that the Prince doesn't die.) 3. The R.O.U.S.'s (Rodents Of Unusual Size) fight was too long and not necessary. Other than those things, this is a entertaining movie. Not among my Top 30, nor will it ever be. Cary Elwes did a great job as Weslry, and I have to mention the great performance of Andre The Giant. He was funny, and very strong. Too bad he died in 1994. Anoother actor's performance is noteworthy. Mandy Patkintin and Wallace Shawn, who played Inigo and Vizini respectively. Billy Crystal stole the whole movie, even though he was only in the movie for about ten minutes. His character was very important as it turned out. Overall, this is a good movie, but I recommend you mute the words above, and the fight scene with the R.O.U.S.'s. My Score: 7/10  "
143149,tt0198781,abrafocus,united states,10,Monster's the 2nd-best Pixar film,"I really loved Monster's, Inc. I first watched the film while on vacation with my family in Utah, back in the summer of 2001. I really didn't like the end that much at first, but then it began to blossom and multiply, if you know what I mean. It eventually found its way into my Top Ten and it has stayed there ever since, not moving much at all. No one but John Goodman and Billy Crystal could have done the voices of Sully and Mike, and James Coburn was excellent as Mr. Waternoose. **Possible spoiler ahead** One main character, known as ""Boo"" is the only human character in the movie. She is maybe 2 years old, I'm not really sure. But she is really cute. SHe can't talk very well, being so young, and the movie makers had a hard time with Mary Gibbs, who provided the voice of Boo. (see the commentary of Monster's, Inc,) All in all, Monster's, Inc. is a great movie. Watch it. My score: 10/10  "
143763,tt0032138,abrafocus,united states,6,Not one of my favorites,"I do NOT hate this movie, although my post might appear in the ""Hated it"" section. Aside from the extremely annoying songs, this would be a very good movie. Songs like, ""The Wicked Witch is Dead,"" and ""If I Were King of the Forest"" are among the most annoying. There is one song that is always worth listening to. It's ""Over the Rainbow,"" which was voted the best movie song ever. I disagree with that, but it's still a very good song. The only other thing that really bothers me about this movie is the fact that it's so predictable. I knew they would eventually make it, and the Witch of the West would somehow ""die"", and that the Wizard was the same guy who played the doorman and the cabbie (carriage driver.) Frank Morgan, who plays numerous roles, including the Wizard, did his roles very well. Judy Garland and all the others did well, too. Unless you're a fan, don't watch this movie very often. It is Rated ""G,"" but there are a few intense moments. My Score: 6/10.  "
152177,tt0325980,abrafocus,united states,10,Great music and acting,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of the greatest movies of all time! Johnny Depp gives his best performance in this humorous movie that was inspired by a Disneyland ride, though I didn't really see anything in common, except perhaps the treasure and ""dead men tell no tails"" bit. *** Spoilers ahead*** Orlando Bloom (Lord of the Rings trilogy) plays William Turner, a blacksmith/ future pirate. Although he says he never will be a pirate, he does some things that prove he is a good pirate. WARNING! There are a few words that I would classify as bad, but you can mute the words if you know where to look. I own the soundtrack to this movie; I highly recommend it for those who love music.  "

This movie is, by all means, appropriate for children, the kind that is nearly non-existent today, but it is still not worth seeing to a guy like me. I really don't like the songs that much, though Page O'Hara, the voice of Belle, did an exceptional job. Need I say anything about Robby Benson? He did great as the beast, and later when he was turned back into a human, as the prince. Other than the weird songs, it was OKay, but don't watch this movie unless you can put up with a 6-year old (daughter/sister) singing her head off. My Score: 3/20.  "

If you would like to see a GREAT movie with a lot of action and special effects that just improve the overall quality... So honestly go watch it because this is way more than just a comic movie.

This is a profound story about human nature trying to balance between the human desire of power the love of family. Every time I have the opportunity of see this film, I try to figure out how Francis resolve anything in the way to make a complete piece about the family issues, but in the same time a great portrait of the Italian mafia that today it's the ambiance and pace formula for the mafia films and also in Mexico the formula for the Mexican cartels. Also the great decision to invite a Al Pacino for the main role it's an excellent direction just below of the Brandon's performance. "

It's wit is razor sharp, it's writing crisp, it's direction very insightful and powerful. It's one of those films that has an extrememly complicated journey at it's core -- one of those films that you don't easily forget because it's about authentic situations (even if they are in this film fantastic in nature) which have a real soul and meaning behind them.

A simple movie to speak about the life of a normal man attaining different characters at different stages but one of the best movies to entertain you. i would suggest all to make this movie as a prominent one in their DVD library.

When the first act shows you expect the classic Disney message: ""Don't give up, you can do it, you can make your dreams because you 're strong."" But, the movie gives a incredible turn of message that leaves you in reflexion. 10 years ago, Disney released a pretty lame and awful CGI movie (Chicken Little), now, ten years later, they make a masterpiece of animation.

I had two thoughts: I missed seeing a scene where President Roosvelt dies and Goebbels excitedly informs Hitler, predicting that the tide would now turn in the Nazis' favor. Of course, nothing changed and their exuberance was brief. (Perhaps they filmed such a scene and left it on the cutting room floor.) Second, the depiction of the bunker was so realistic that I had the feeling that the filmmakers had been given secret access to the real bunker. (After all, it still must exist, deep under Wilhemstrasse in Berlin, and will probably eventually become a tourist site, perhaps a hundred years from now.)  "

There was not much action and Pacino and the other robber were both good actors but it was a bit over the top and there wasn't much interesting action in this. I kind of knew everything that was going to happen so it just seemed predictable that way. I guess maybe it is possible that people long ago told me the best parts of the movie and I forgot about it but knew it was going to happen once I started watching the movie. The scene where they leave the bank is pretty cool with some good tension but other than that I was just really bored most of the time, very disappointing to me because I was expecting such a great movie.

Beautiful story-line along with the great acting made this movie everything a fan was waiting for. The movie also represents a bit of a struggle when trying to understand what exactly is happening out there in space, but after defining moments like founding Dr. Mann's ship with him inside alive and revealing Prof. Brand's secret, the story becomes far more complicated but exiting. I never doubted that every movie Nolan has participated in is full of unexpected defining moments and genius thoughts that finally blow your mind, but i have to say that this movie has filled me with many philosophical encounterings. One aspect that i admire of Nolan's clean job is how he manages to make something that far from our reality as a trip through galaxies so believable and real. What else is left to say but thanking the best film director for an amazing piece of his geniality. I would dare to say that many Oscars are on their way to Mcconaughey and Nolan's hands, but only a few months are left to find out, i hope that this impeccable set of movies never stop being done.

What really kept me going were the amount of asinine things that were happening in each scene and I'm a big fan of movies that can accomplish this.

In my book, both versions get 10 of 10, but if you have the time it is definatly worth watching the redux version. Its just the little additions in the beginning and middle of the film that add to the mood and themes of innocence, desperation, and the dwidling goodness of man that can be found in the war. The French plantation scenes seemed, when I watched redux for the first time, a bit long and unnecessary, mostly because I wanted to arrive at the Kurtz complex.

Many great directors have worked with his stories and have given the audience what they want to see. The Shawshank Redemption is another one of them. But there is a reason why it is not just another one of them.  The movie represents courage, faith, anger, sufferance, patience and all the other components of a perfect drama. It teaches so much and is quite a slow movie. Yet it is one of the most exiting movies I have seen in my life. The greatest thing about this movie is that it won't ever bore you. When you sit to watch a 142 minute long movie, it is not unnatural to look at the clock and see how much of it is left. But I have not looked at the clock once in all the many times that I have seen this movie. The time frame where the movie takes place is very large. But for not once have I felt that it was going too fast.  Director Frank Darabont who also wrote the screenplay for the movie did a great job with excellent actors like Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.

87963,tt0361748,Abrar Nadir,united kingdom,1,Propganda,"Good Fantasy Movie ""We know the story, a WWII tale told only as Tarantino can. (Fictional of course) A war film hasn't been done like this before. Brad Pitt as Lt. Aldo Raine leads the Basterds in Nazi occupied France. Their goal - killin' Nazi's. Christoph Waltz as Colonel Hans Landa plays a similar role on the other side. He's know as the ""Jew Hunter"" and goes about his business as ruthless as no other. The third sub story consists of a young Jewish refugee, Shosanna Dreyfus, who witnesses the slaughter of her family. And she, of course, wishes to plot revenge on the Germans for her devastating lose. There actually is three stories here intertwining and connecting with each other. If you know anything about Tarantino or his films, this is nothing new for him. War has never been been so fun. The Basterds, are haunting, but at the same time, very funny, at times even hilarious. The dark comedy aspect play a big aspect in this as in many other Tarantino films. The entertainment and hilarity is led by Brad Pitt. I found him extremely funny and entertaining. I couldn't wait to see him on screen again. Even with his crazy accent, he works in this type of film. Also making great impressions were M«∏lanie Laurent and Christoph Waltz, who were tremendous. The film was filled with noteworthy performances. The story itself, has so many historical inaccuracies to even count, but so what? It isn't meant to be a documentary. Tarantino wanted to have fun with, as should we. The cinematography department deserves big props with beautiful vibrant colors highlighting the film. You've really got to love the last line in the film... but Pulp Fiction remains his masterpiece. Quentin Tarantino among all other things, is an entertainer. WWII, is one of the most tragic events in history, but Tarantino some how manages to make it fun. Inglourious Basterds is a fun film, it's tremendously entertaining, shocking, dramatic, suspenseful, and funny at the same time. Jam packed with everything you look for in a movie, done with that certain Tarantino style, it's worth being checked out.

Visually, TDKR was breathtaking -- even awe-inspiring. But the poor sound made it extremely hard to follow, and therefore disappointing. My only ""spoiler"" comment is maybe not really a ""spoiler"" at all. It is intended mainly for the director: Mr. Nolan, the subtlety and finesse you used at the end of ""Inception"" (the spinning top that may -- or may not -- have toppled) would have been a great way to end TDKR, also. You could have just shown us Alfred's beatific smile when he sat down at the table in the sidewalk caf«∏ -- and left us to figure out the rest for ourselves.  "
82100,tt0338013,abrien74,united states,9,Weeping while the credits rolled,"I always get skeptical when Jim Carrey comes out with a new movie - it's going to be Jim Carrey playing Crazy Carrey again. Been there, done that, it's older than old. That said, I did not recognize Jim Carrey in his role as Joel and I did not recognize his acting style in this particular movie. He was absolutely incredible - completely different. I was shocked! Kate Winslet, brilliant as always. I loved Kate in this role. Her accent was perfect - sounded exactly like a friend of mine who was raised in Brooklyn. I won't give a summary because I don't want to repeat everything that's already been said. I will say this: Eternal Sunshine reminded me what it's like to be totally heartbroken, which is why I cried at the end. The acting is so good that I felt everything the characters felt - the happiness, the amusement, the communication, the lack of communication, the anger, the betrayal, the jealousy, the hatred, the desperation...the absolute heartbreak. It must have been emotionally draining for Kate and Carrey while making this movie. I highly recommend this film. It's a tad slow in parts, it's a tad talky in parts, but I recommend it simply because the story is utterly fascinating, the acting is incredibly real and the script is damn fine. 9/10 (9 because Kirsten Dunst annoys me)  "

The animation is top notch, of course! You can almost feel the texture of the cloth Woody or Bullseye is made out of just based on it's looks. That's how good it is. The voice acting- superb. They have the original cast with a few added into the mix (some are subtle, like Bonnie Hunt or Whoopi Goldberg), and EVERYONE fits their part! Music- Randy Newman, you never fail to disappoint me, and this is no exception. Humor- Joke after joke, coming at you like bullets, leaving you no time to catch you breath because you're laughing so hard- until the climax, when you are either bawling your eyes out, or your heart is pounding at the speed of light, or both. There are many emotional parts in this movie that you won't forget, especially if you are an adult and have had that one bunch of special toys you just didn't want to let go of when you were a kid. Writing, music, humor, animation, acting, and emotion were all the best in any movie of 2010 and I seriously hope this wins Best Animated Feature, Best Music, and at least be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. So bottom line is- stop reading this review, get off the computer, and go see this movie! And if it's already out on DVD by the time you're reading this, go buy it!  "
115219,tt0167404,abrown975,united states,9,An absolutely brilliant masterpiece in every aspect it utilizes,"There are only a handful of movies out there that have everything in it. Thankfully, this movie is one of them. What I mean by that is it has the horror (the absolutely creepy/terrifying type, not the crappy something-pops-out-and-startles-you junk), the sadness (Jesus, I pretty much just end up feeling sorry for every character), the happiness (and when the happiness comes, you feel so genuinely happy and warm that you could cry), and the best part- the twists (the kind that hits you like a ton of bricks, not some stupid, run-o-the-mill misleads and whatnot). But that's not all. The acting was beyond superb. Bruce Willis was spectacular as the main character, Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I honestly think an Academy Award nomination should have been given for him. But the Academy made up for that in giving, first off, Toni Collette a nomination. She had such a great performance as the distraught mother who only wanted a normal life for her son. But the real praise should go to young Haley Joel Osment, who also had an A.A. nomination, but should have won in my opinion. I will not go into depth because there is just not enough good things to say about his absolutely brilliant performance. The only thing I will say is that he had one of the most convincing and emotional performances of anyone I have ever seen, and he was only 11 at the time! However, a lot of the applause should go to M. Night. Shyamalan, whose writing and directing just goes to show that when he has the right material, he can REALLY make it work! I really hope he gets more opportunities to show off his talent, let's just hope he doesn't do anymore TV show remakes (The Last Airbender was just plain awful). This movie is such a beautiful masterpiece, and that's saying something considering it's a horror film!  "

But that's not how the movie was AT ALL when I saw it in theaters! The plot was not very formulaic (if it was at all), there was plenty of suspense, there was some unexpected parts that gave it more character than other movies like this, the acting by the star-studded cast was flawless, and the animation was superb! This is definitely up there as one of the best animated films of 2010! So take the kids to see it, but if you happen to miss it, you should absolutely buy it because not only will it captivate the children, but it will most-likely captivate you as well!

105351,tt0050986,abscissa1,canada,9,Bergman Speaks to the Big Questions," Although I do not agree that this film presents ""renewed belief in mankind,"" it is certainly a dramatic epic that consoles a lonely spirit. I prefer this to Bergman's Seventh Seal (1957), because for me the images and themes are more immediate and relevant. From the Freudian to the postmodern, you will find it in this film. It is not a cute pseudo intellectual movie that rewards with cheap plot twists and predictable fates, but rather a deep and intense journey into the soul of a man with a cold and dark heart. For the aging, for the lonely, for the misguided, this film is confrontational in its challenges to our beliefs of time, social relationships, and ethics.  "

67594,tt1345836,Absolem,ireland,10,The ending we deserved and the ending we needed,"Batman has been a major part of popular culture for the better part of the last century. With this film, Christopher Nolan concludes his interpretation of this iconic character. And what a conclusion it is. Picking up eight years after The Joker's rampage, we spend the film's first act observing the state Gotham is in. Harvey Dent is still seen as the hero, Batman the villain. Organised crime is a thing of the past and the city is at peace. Crippled by the fact that he is no longer needed, along with the never ending pain he suffers from the loss of his parents and his beloved Rachel, Bruce Wayne has become a recluse. Christian Bale portrays brilliantly portrays the character's agony with stunning accuracy. Bruce is brought out of hiding by a number of factors. His loyal butler Alfred (Michael Caine) contributes greatly to a number of the film's more tear-jerking scenes. Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) once again delivers his sharp wit as he puts things into perspective. Idealistic rookie cop John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) proves a character that Bruce can relate to on a personal level. Philanthropist Miranda Tate (Marion Cotillard) shows Bruce that love can still be found when it is thought to be lost. Finally, cat burglar Selina Kyle (Anne Hathaway) makes Bruce question his place in society, and whether his is doing enough with the wealth he has been given. However, the biggest factor is Bane (Tom Hardy). With his unyielding strength, brilliant military tactics and unending will, he proves to be Batman's greatest foe. After the impressive turn from Heath Ledger as the Joker in the previous film, it was a masterstroke to introduce a villain who was the complete opposite. With Bane, nothing is left to the imagination. While the villains of the previous films never felt like a match for Batman, Bane proves himself to be one. For once, you actually worry that Batman will lose. Taking on the iconic role of Catwoman, Hathaway proves herself the ideal choice for the role. Showing the characters morals, physical prowess and conflicted nature in equal measure, she brings the character to life like never before. Hardy is menacing as Bane, and Gordon-Levitt stands out as the only police officer besides Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman) to show genuine passion for the city's welfare. The film's final act brings a gut-wrenching, heart-stopping and emotional climax like no other. The past comes back to haunt the characters and the trilogy is brought full circle is the most satisfying way imaginable. Nolan achieves what many considered to be impossible and outdoes himself once again. So ends the greatest series of superhero movies the world has ever seen. I pity whoever has to reboot the franchise after this.  "
157650,tt0848228,Absolem,ireland,9,Very entertaining. Superhero ensemble done right.,"Over the past five years we have been exposed to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which has introduced us to a multitude of characters. Finally, it all comes to a head in this massive ensemble. Following the arrival of the Norse God Loki (Tom Hiddleston), S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) assembles a team of six of the most powerful individuals the world has ever seen to combat the threat. However, their egos and suspicions of one another create a lot of friction in the group. Many feared that the screen time of this film would be dominated by a single character, with the rest simply playing supporting roles. They needn't have worried, as each Avenger is given an appropriate amount of attention. Returning to their roles from the previous Marvel films are Robert Downey Jr. as the pretentious yet well-meaning industrialist Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as the recently resurrected World War II hero Steve Rogers/Captain America, Chris Hemsworth as Norse God Thor (Loki's stepbrother) and Scarlett Johansson as enigmatic spy Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner expands upon his brief cameo in ""Thor"" as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, by far the most interesting member of the group. Replacing Edward Norton as Bruce Banner/The Hulk is Mark Ruffalo, who fills the role surprisingly well. Badass as usual is Jackson as Fury. We also see quite a lot of fan favorite Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg), who makes his most memorable appearance so far. Returning in supporting roles are Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Dr. Eric Selvig (Stellan Skarsgard). Introduced in this film is Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), who doesn't really get enough screen time to make a proper impression. While the entire cast is solid, the best performance by far is by Hiddleston. As the film's primary villain, he cuts an imposing figure, peering a death glare at the audience and relishing every word as he attempts to get inside the heroes' heads. Director Joss Whedon, the man behind ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"", once again shows his ability to create a well-made ensemble piece. Following in the footsteps of Jon Favreau, Kenneth Branagh, Louis Letterier and Joe Johnston, he was the ideal choice for this film. Whedon was able to cover all of the necessary areas, from the emotional impact of the death of a major character, to the film's many moments of humor and the many heart-racing action scenes. Another triumph is the film's special effects. The motion capture used to create the Hulk has made him look more realistic than any previous live-action portrayal, Loki's army of Chitauri aliens are a convincing force to be reckoned with and vehicles are created that could never exist in reality. Furthermore, Whedon alumni Alexis Denisof is unrecognizable as The Other, a mysterious villain who hints at what is going on behind the scenes (and what will come to the front in future installments). While it won't win any Oscars, The Avengers succeeds in all of the intended areas. A character-driven story with heart, action and humor, it brings these iconic characters to the big screen in a way that does them justice, and will thrill audiences from beginning to end.  "
122654,tt0758758,absolut034,united states,9,Great movie,"I saw this movie at an advanced screening in Nashville on August 23, 2007. Although it was a little long, it was a great movie. The movie follows an Emory grad who struggles to find the meaning of life. He travels across the country (ultimately to Alaska) and along the way he touches lives and becomes a man. This movie really makes a person reevaluate their priorities in life and I personally found it to be inspiring. The director did a beautiful job with the story line and the landscapes were incredible. Vince Vaughn plays a small part and is his usual lovable self. Emile Hirsch was wonderful and has a bright future in acting. One shocker was the random brief nudity of men and women. This movie is worth seeing at least once.  "
47820,tt0120689,absolut2,united states,8,Awesome,"A character-driven movie requires a lot from the cast, and fortunately when it comes to cast, The Green Mile delivers. As the poster of the movie tells, this movie stars Tom Hanks as Paul Edgecomb, senior prison guard of the mile, and as always he performs very well indeed. Yet the cast around him is even more spectacular, perhaps partially due to them being relatively unknown. With a face you know, one inevitably remembers previous performances, and the new role is coloured by this. Doug Hutchison as Percy Wetmore, a mean spirited prison guard was particularly impressive, yet his character could have been given more depth. The most captivating was the performance of Michael Duncan. It is hard to find a flaw in this movie. The camera-work is superb, cast wonderful and direction flawless. The movie's considerable length, a bit over three hours, is something that had me worried. Yet the marvellous cast and the peaceful yet firm pace of the movie held my attention progressively through the three hours right to the touching culmination. Many will find this movie to be too long, but I for one was delighted of the style, combination of simplicity of events and depth of characters and conversation. All in all the The Green Mile is a very touching drama, with the joys and sorrows of the life pictured with great skill, if not the best movie of the year. Five out of five.  "
42907,tt0816692,AbsolutelySweetNya,belgium,5,Sensation is the key,"I'm not a Nolan fan but I always want to give his movies a try because mostly I do like the general ideas for the stories that are told. I really tried to watch this one without prejudice. And after it was done, I sat there with the same feeling that I had after Inception: it's interesting but there is so much unnecessary ""action"" and plot holes that it loses so much of its potential. And that's sad! The first 40 minutes or so are really slow. After that the tempo goes up but so many details are overlooked that it becomes a bit hard to watch. This makes me very cynical and looking at the clock to see when the movie will be over. Also, playing with time is such an interesting idea but it has to be done right and you can't just be sloppy with details like I've seen more than a few times in this film. I wasn't crazy about McConaughey's performance, I kinda liked Hathaway. The visuals are good but I put on 2001: A Space Odyssey right after I finished Interstellar and to me these graphics are just as good, even though they're almost 50 years old. And the mood and eerie atmosphere are loads better! Besides, Interstellar seemed like a bit of a remake of 2001, and as is usually the case with remakes, not better than the original. I gave Interstellar a 5 star rating because of the concept and the effects.  "
145288,tt1392214,AbsolutelySweetNya,belgium,8,Decent with unnecessary action,"I think that a movie needs to be watched at least twice to know whether it's good or not. Lots of movies aren't worth a second viewing but Prisoners was OK enough to see again. The first time I liked it. The plot is interesting, quite original despite the topic, kidnapped children. It's a bit depressing and not for sensitive souls. The actors are doing a great job and there's a dark atmosphere throughout the entire movie, mainly because of the great cinematography. When I watched it a second time and the story was no longer a surprise, I thought there was too much added thrill factor/action scenes. I think it would be a lot better without the excessive violence, a rapid car scene that is way too long and so on. I rated it an 8, a bit high maybe but I tend to like cinema with certain atmospheres and this thriller does it quite well.  "
102821,tt1305806,absorbtion1,united kingdom,6,a mediocre film of good ideas,"This film is a bit like an empty pie: beautifully executed and still full of calories, the only thing it seems to be missing is a solid filling of a plot. Neither the detective story nor the love story in it make much sense and aren't really worth writing home about. If, however, we mute our internal critic for a while and try to believe the story, the film will unfold as something more than just a well-photographed flaw. Essentially, ""The secret in their eyes"" is a fable about coping with unresolved past - and, no less importantly, about whether such coping on its own provides enough nourishment for creativity. Some time in the middle of his career, Benjam«n Esposito, a legal counselor, encounters a rape/murder case that he cannot resolve. The reasons for this are hardly convincing, but let's say this is mainly due to the powers that be as well as his own hotheadedness. This case haunts him so much that he befriends the husband of the victim - Ricardo Morales, a somewhat unimaginative banker, who would go to the train station each morning trying to trace the murder suspect. Esposito is very empathic to Morales's suffering, almost unnaturally so. He is horrified that Morales's life from now on is going to be a life sentence, with nothing else happening. Morales is indeed in a very bad way at the beginning, but at some point we're left wondering whether he copes with the events better than Esposito himself. There's also an unresolved (and very unconvincingly presented) love story between Esposito and his young upper-middle class boss Irene that happens at the same time, which leaves both of them scarred. It is 25 years later and Esposito, now retired, is still trying to reconcile with the past. His take on this is now is to try writing a novel about the case. In his pursuits he revisits Morales and Irene, who both seem... no, not to have moved on, but rather to have found a positive way to get on with their lives. Only Esposito dwells on the past. To make the things worse, his writing isn't going well, friends find it too dry - as if notes to a novel rather than the novel itself. It is only when Esposito discovers what exactly Morales has done (and is doing) to be able to look ahead rather than ""serve a life sentence"" that he realizes he needs to stop pondering the past and act. The actions required are on a considerably smaller scale, but they seem to do the job. We don't even need to care whether his novel was a success in the end. That courage is a necessary ingredient for both happiness and creativity is the message that the film delivers much more sincerely than the particulars of the plot itself.  "
133208,tt2024544,Abstract News,united states,10,Lift not the painted veil...,"Is Solomon a sambo? In the sense of a token black who goes to great extremes of foolishness to entertain and appease white observers and to protect his privileged social position. His fiddle playing enthusiasm, his constant claim at freedom while those like him are being held in bondage, and his unmerciful act of turning down Patsy's plea to take her life, though he's able to take the whip in his hand to beat her, and his constant begging of whites to perform favors for him. Throughout the film two stories are being told. One story is the story of a free man who is thrown into slavery and makes it home in the end. The other is the story of a man who imagines that he is free. The veil is never lifted for Solomon, but for us, the viewer, it is. We have the opportunity to briefly see him in all the vanity of his individualism and selfishness. A man that will use his intelligence to follow the rules, and risk his life just to send a letter, rather than save a single soul. We too like Solomon are complicit in our privilege. While the practice of slavery continues, we dare to use words like freedom and liberty. We turn our backs on cries for help, like Solomon did to Patsy, and like a fellow slave did to him. We fail to see that there is something more morally significant than our personal lives. Interesting how the cover shows Solomon running when he never tried to run. Many of us know the stories of slaves who ran, escaped, rebelled, and refused to participate. Why did McQueen choose this story of a slave whose spirit no one had to break because it was already broken. Maybe it is more representative of the contemporary spirit of acquiescence. Have ye leisure, comfort, calm, Shelter, food, love's gentle balm? Or what is it ye buy so dear With your pain and with your fear? The seed ye sow, another reaps; The wealth ye find, another keeps; The robes ye weave, another wears; The arms ye forge, another bears. --Percy Shelley  "
92553,tt0372784,abstrak003,united states,10,Character development in a Comic Book/Plot movie? What a GREAT IDEA!,"Saw a free screening on Tuesday. I must say, I had my expectations low for this one, as the previous Batman franchises was just cartoony, over the top, and flat out mind dumbing. Why do studios continually think that spending money on 'bankable stars' and special effects will make a ton of money on box office receipts? Granted ""Batman Begins"" has a pretty sizable budget, but they made the right decision with casting actors that can act and hiring a director that shares the same vision of the comic book. You will not see any caricatures of the comic book, but rather be immersed in how Bruce Wayne has that internal conflict of morality as he becomes Batman. Christopher Nolan takes his time developing Bruce Wayne's character in the image that Bob Kane had with his own flair to it. Anyone familiar with Nolan, Christian Bale, and Cillian Murphy's work will not be disappointed with this movie. Make no mistake about it, it is a dark movie, which is what makes it so great. Nolan uses CG effects very sparingly (thank God!). I rarely give movies a 10 out of 10, as I am pretty brutal with ratings, but Nolan resurrects a failed franchise. Personally, this is what Batman should have been all along - The Dark Knight! Anyone who is a Batman, Nolan, Bale, Murphy fan will not be disappointed. I only wish I took that money I spent on ""Star Wars: ... Sith"" went to ""Batman"".  "

Before fight club i was familiar with David Fincher with The game and Seven and i realized that Fincher is really a director but in my opinion his fight club is something else and his best work. The movie has a great start and the actors Edward Norton and Brad Pitt were really amazing in the film. About the story i have to say we don't see a lot of good movies with a deep and interesting story like fight club but here we have one of those unique stories. The just brothers does it great for the music, it is really matched with the story and very effective in their parts like when Tyler left the wheel in the car, at that scene music gets me blown away.

133698,tt2278388,abucketofcorn,united states,10,Perfection of Anderson,"Take your hands off my Lobby Boy. This is outrageously brilliantly funny. A wonderful modern-day classic. An instant gem of this year of 2014. A perfect film of hilarity, laugh out loud comical banter and acting mastery. You the viewer are sent on a trippy world that only Wes Anderson can make up. The costumes, the sets, scenery are all flawless and truly is the Wes Anderson's persona of making films. He has away with telling the story, directing and getting his characters in the flawless brilliant, funny scenarios that will leave the viewer with a lasting impression of his ultimate, original brilliance. The Grand Budapest Hotel is an instant classic. An instant favorite of mine. It is a must see, must praise and as of now, this brilliant film is added to my all-time favorite movies. Adding it to my all-time favorites is a reality that does not happen much. Few films are added to my 1000 movies you should see before you die. I feel this is a film that is magical and truly a gifted weirdness that grabs the viewer in all its twisted comical realities and takes them on an unforgettable funny, dorky, silly wonderful journey of pure originality and perfection. The cast alone is absolutely extraordinary. There are more actors in this film then can be believed. The actors and there characters create an unbelievable persona and sitting for the viewer. All the acting is brilliant. The stars just shine off screen and are bubbly, hilarious, funny, silly, dorky and absolutely entertaining. Wes Anderson is a genius. The story is wild and brilliantly entertaining. A mix of wild comedy and a coloring book flare. I love the narrative and the ultimate conclusion of perfect comical reality. You never know where Anderson is going and that's the ultimate beauty of his cinema world. The Grand Budapest is a wild story of murder, escaped killers, sex with old people, a lobby boy and deserts and a painting of a boy with an apple. The shining stars are Fiennes and Revolori. Both work off each other in a golden comical way of perfection. Revolori as the Lobby Boy deserves an award for his character of comical banter and flare. Fiennes deserves to be nominated for best actor this year for this wild, over the top beauty of comical mastery. He gave it his all and created a character I will remember the rest of my movie loving life. I love Wes Anderson's creation of characters and the beauty of their persona's and dialogue and the ultimate situations only an original master like Anderson could come up with. I think the golden ticket goes to the surroundings and odd coloring sets and motels and situations where it was filmed. It bleeds nostalgia and retro eye candy. Awesome spots of filming that give all the more reality to the picture. Willem Defoe as the murdering thug is a priceless character. Defoe is a god of acting and he aced this motorcycle, leather wearing, fist rings and mayhem to a memorable and laughable reality on screen. Brody is awesome as the money hungry son and Edward Norton as the law is a magical moment. I have to say this is Anderson's best. I love most all his films but this one truly shines in the odd, original and twisted nature of his cinematic beauty of silliness and over all cast of characters. His creation through, only scenarios he could make up and film as visionary, shines for the watcher. Gustave and his sidekick The Lobby Boy is on the run. Gustave is accused of murdering his elderly lover. He has to figure out the truth through twisted scenarios of adventures and actions that cloud his path of freeing himself. One crazy ordeal after another leads to a wonderful hilarious good time. ""Can I interest you in a plate of mush?"" www.abucketofcorn.com  "
1871,tt0111161,abum190,united states,10,My new favorite movie,"Before I saw this movie, it was hard for me to imagine why so many people liked it. I figured it must be one of those gritty movies that people like because of its harsh realism, but in truth it is so much more than that. In fact, I don't find it very gritty at all. I can now understand why it is the second highest movie on IMDb's Top 250 and why so many of my friends list it as their favorite movie. It is the most emotionally powerful movie I've ever seen and I doubt anything I see will top it.  Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a man convicted of killing his wife and her lover. Morgan Freeman plays the convicted killer Ellis Redding that befriends Andy in prison. These are two very touching and true performances. Tim Robbins should have at least been nominated for an Oscar for the quiet intensity he brought to his role. He takes on the right sense of mystery required for the role and he gives the movie the conviction it needs to reach its emotional heights. Marlon Brando claimed that some roles are actor-proof- the story is so good that no actor can mess it up. This could possibly be one of those roles, but I can't help feeling that a lesser actor would have overacted and destroyed Robbins's character. Morgan Freeman was nominated, and justly so (though it is an injustice that he was chosen above Robbins; they both are equals in this movie). He complements Robbins beautifully as a stoic man that understands prison life better than anyone else. He also narrates the movie; we see things through his eyes and experience things through his words. As in Million Dollar Baby, his voice provides the movie with its thematic focus. The supporting cast is fine, but James Whitmore stands out as the prison librarian.  The actors do not make this a great movie though. They were given a great story and they lived it for us perfectly, but it is the story that lives on after the movie is over. Stephen King may be a pop fiction author, but he has an extraordinary grasp on human nature which is brought to light in Shawshank.  Marlon Brando also said that movies are good because of what we bring to them, and I suppose there's some truth in that, though there are some movies that are good no matter what- Casablanca and Citizen Kane, for example. I don't know which category this movie belongs to and I'm afraid that because I love it so much I don't trust myself to say. I can say, however, that everyone can identify with the triumph of the human spirit, and maybe that explains why it is such a beloved movie.  It really is a shame that The Shawshank Redemption came out in 1994, the same year as Forrest Gump and Pulp Fiction. All three are great movies, and all three deserved Best Picture. But to me, Shawshank is the best of them all and will continue to resonate with me for a long time to come. "
13294,tt0110912,abum190,united states,10,An undeniably great movie,"How Quentin Tarantino managed to pull this off is a mystery. Where he got these characters from is even more of a mystery. This movie is a celebration of all things trashy, and yet I got the feeling that when Tarantino started making this movie he realized he could make it so much more than that. He has a gold mine of character and dialogue here, and he has used it up and more. The best thing about this movie is its dialogue. Everything everyone says is so natural; you believe someone would say these things in real life. Every conversation is essential to the plot, but when they take place they feel spontaneous. Even sequences that would feel contrived under a lesser screenplay or lesser director feel perfect in this movie, such as the scene between Willis and the cabdriver, or the scene with Uma Thurman and John Travolta dancing at the restaurant. Not only are conversations natural, but the way events shape out feels like real life also. When we are expecting Mia and Vince to get on the good foot and do the bad thing, what we get instead is a crisis in which Mia almost dies. When we expect Butch to get killed, instead he does the killing. The movie felt like it was leading me in one direction but then led me in another, but I didn't feel gypped because it felt right. And the actors are something else in this movie. John Travolta did not give the performance I expected from him- I expected hammy Travolta and what I got was understated Travolta that fit into everything around him; definitely not what I expected. Sam Jackson has the most fun in this movie, but manages to keep it real at the same time. I can't even get into everyone else, simply because there are so many good performances. I gave the movie a 10 (something I've done for only three other movies) because it's so complete. I had trouble figuring out what the point of the movie is, and I'm still not sure, but it really doesn't matter. The stories are so intriguing and the characters are so engaging, I don't really care about the point of it all. I just want to see it again.  "
18109,tt0137523,abum190,united states,7,"Oh, Fight Club, you almost had me there","Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties. But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly. Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first. For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes? It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment.  "
29358,tt0099685,abum190,united states,8,Such a great movie,"And yet the ending felt like a copout, an anticlimactic way for the filmmakers to get out of coming up with something better. This movie deserved a great ending, and it got a quick job instead. But maybe that's as it should be. Maybe there was no better way to end this incredible movie. It's a true story, so obviously the movie had to end a certain way. However, considering the talent involved, you'd expect something more. But however much I didn't like the ending was a quarter of how much I liked the rest of the movie. Maybe this isn't how the mob actually works, but the way Martin Scorcese films it seems about as realistic as a movie could get. The narrator takes us into the inner workings of the mob, explaining how everything is done and what everyone's job is. Of course, that would mean nothing without good characters, and the main character, Henry Hill (Ray Liotta), is a great one. Not a great person, mind you; he's wanted to be in the mob all his life and the movie chronicles all sorts of nasty things he and his colleagues do to other people. But the character is great, partially because Liotta is so magnetizing. One of my friends thinks Liotta is the worst in the movie, but I don't think so. We see everything from his perspective, so we actually don't see a whole lot of him. But when we do, the movie is on. Joe Pesci and Robert De Niro give good performances as Hill's best friends, and Pesci deserved his Oscar for being a hothead that causes the mob a lot of trouble. But I really think Liotta takes the best performance in the movie and his was definitely an underrated one. Lorraine Bracco is also effective and versatile as Hill's wife. The two of them are more than convincing from beginning to end and the movie would not be the same without them. Martin Scorcese has made a brilliant movie, never boring, always alive. He's obviously a master director, but that darn ending∂?maybe the next time I see the movie the ending won't bug me so much. Maybe I'm overreacting. I certainly wouldn't want my qualms about the resolution to keep anyone from seeing such an incredible film.  "
31532,tt0133093,abum190,united states,8,I love this movie,"The Matrix has become such an iconic movie that it's hard to say anything new about it. I'm hesitant to try. Everyone knows it's a good movie- and if they don't believe it to be good, they know it's a well-loved movie. I, for one, love it, but I don't think it deserves to be so high up in the Top 250. The Matrix is a good example of a movie that pretends to be about something in order to keep your attention. The truth is that the story in this movie is so good and the characters so engaging that it doesn't need the message (be careful about getting too dependent on your machines- they might kill you). The way the story is executed is also nearly ingenious. When we first meet Neo (Keanu Reeves), a computer programmer for a software business that sidelines as a black market dealer in computer parts, we do not know the secret of the Matrix. The Wachowski brothers do not reveal the secret till about a quarter of the way through the movie- the perfect time to do it; any shorter, and it wouldn't have been a shock; any longer, and the movie would have become boring and there would have been less action, which is the real star of this movie. Neo meets Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), a man proclaimed to be a terrorist by the government through the media, who gives Neo the choice between returning to his boring life and discovering the truth about the Matrix. Neo's choice sends him and the characters he meets into intense gun-and-fistfights. In between the action sequences, Morpheus spouts some philosophical tripe that could be considered deep, but there's really no life behind it; I didn't care. The movie is fun, and that's all that matters. I don't think it's a great movie, but that doesn't matter. If you're just looking to have fun and sit on the edge of your seat for a few hours, then this is a great movie for that.  "
33073,tt0076759,abum190,united states,8,I love these movies,"This one especially. It all started right here, and despite the cheesy lines and some of the bad effects (even though most of them are pretty incredible, especially for that time), I can't help but love it. Maybe it's the actors. Because let's face it, these actors were born to play these parts. Mark Hamill never really had another hit, and really, honestly, he's not a very good actor. But he was perfect for this role- some may say he's too whiny, but isn't that really what Luke was at the beginning? The same goes for Carrie Fisher- she never had another big, important movie like these, but I can't imagine the movie without her. Maybe other people can, and that's okay for them, but for me, I can't see anyone else as Leia. And what would this movie be without Harrison Ford? I have a theory that the reason the newest three Star Wars don't match up at all to the old ones is because the characters aren't interesting at all. Anakin is vaguely interesting, but we already know his story and Hayden Christensen doesn't do anything with the part to keep us intrigued. Amidala is boring, and while I think Ewan McGregor is a great actor, there was nothing he could do to instill anything worth watching into the character they wrote for Obi-Wan. And that's why these movies need Harrison Ford. Han Solo is without a doubt the most interesting character. In the new ones, there's no one with snappy retorts and sharp comments to keep the pace of the movie up. In the new ones, there's no one to give us the surprise ending we knew was coming but we didn't know how they were going to pull it off. I don't know about anyone else, but when I first saw this, I thought Han had actually left for good. It didn't even occur to me that he would come back to save the day in the end. And I'm not stupid. At least that's what they tell me. And without Harrison Ford, Han Solo would not be near as interesting as he is. Alec Guinness deserves plenty of credit too. His part is without a doubt the most boring in the movie, yet he makes it worth watching. His lines are usually descriptions, clich«∏s, or they provide backstory. The actors in CSI will tell you that lines like that are hard to make entertaining. Yet Guinness is able to do so with years of training. It's no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar for it. Oh, and there's the awesome action sequences with the light saber duels that, even though they tend to repeat themselves over and over, are incredibly dazzling. There's the epic feel and the neverending story of it all. There's the beautiful scenery and realistic set pieces. There's James Earl Jones's and Anthony Daniels's respectively foreboding and entertaining voiceovers, with Vader's wonderfully addicting breathing. There's the sweeping cinematography and that even makes the intimate scenes seem big while still retaining the urgency and the, well, intimacy of it all. It's a good movie.  "
35812,tt0102926,abum190,united states,9,An incredibly thrilling movie,"If The Silence of the Lambs had been about Clarice chasing after Buffalo Bill, the movie would have been boring, and would have gone on a list filled with every other average thriller ever made. If The Silence of the Lambs had simply been about Clarice and Hannibal, we would've been deprived one of the most thrilling sequences ever put to film. All three of the characters- Clarice, Hannibal, and Buffalo Bill- are essential to why this movie is so good. The movie works effectively as a thriller in Clarice's chase of Buffalo Bill, there's no doubt about that. But the added dynamic of Hannibal probing into Clarice's psyche makes it so much better. When Clarice (Jodie Foster) is sent to Hannibal Lecter's (Anthony Hopkins) cell to learn from him and get information on the serial killer Buffalo Bill (Ted Levine), she is told not to give Dr. Lecter any personal information. He is a former psychiatrist who ate his victims, and he can deduce volumes about a person just by looking at her. Clarice, in an attempt to gain his trust, does give him personal information. I wouldn't call this a mistake, even though she went against her supervisor's advice, because she does gain his trust, and in the process, we learn more about Lecter and Clarice than we could've otherwise. A plot summary would have you believe that the story of this movie is Clarice's search for Buffalo Bill through Lecter, but the real story lies in how Lecter reveals information about Bill to Clarice and what we learn about the two of them in the process. A lesser movie would have depended on action and violence to tell this story- and make no mistake, there is definitely violence in this movie. But the brilliance of The Silence of the Lambs is that it depends on character to tell its story. And thank God for Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins being in it to make those characters. Jodie Foster plays a woman in a man's world, and she conveys the awkwardness and defiant streak that this brings out in her. There are moments where she plays the sycophant to get what she needs from the men around her, and others where she takes charge and we can hear the self-consciousness in her voice. Hopkins plays a creature that also happens to be human. He plays Lecter creepily, of course, and he pulls that aspect off quite well; but there is more to Lecter than just being creepy- he is also brilliant, and he has desires just like any other human being. Hopkins makes this noticeable. Ted Levine has less of a chance to show his chops, but what we do see of him is compelling and unsettling- he makes a wonderful villain. This is one of my favorite movies, now that I've finally seen it. It deserves it's place as one of the top movies of all time because it exceeds all expectations of what it's kind of movie should be, and in the process it surpasses great movies of more dependable genres.

38963,tt0245429,abum190,united states,9,Magical and different,"The movie started and I wasn't quite sure what I was watching. There were moments at the beginning when I had no clue what was happening. But as it continued I was drawn more and more into the story to where I accepted anything the story threw my direction. I was a part of the movie in a way very few movies can involve me. Disney movies have their charms and I'm a big fan of some of them, namely the Pixar movies and a few of the 2D ones, but this will be unlike anything you've ever seen before (unless you're already familiar with Hiyao Miyazaki, in which case you'll probably be able to fully appreciate Spirited Away). I'm not going to ruin the plot for anyone, but I will say that it follows a girl named Chihiro on her journey into a spirit world and her discovery of how to take care of herself and those around her. There is far more to the movie than that, but I'll let you enjoy it for yourself. It's worth it.  "
47843,tt0120689,abum190,united states,8,A profoundly moving movie,"I found myself nearly moved to tears by this film and its characters. The story is wonderful and the movie is cast so well, you can almost forgive the moments where it doesn't feel quite real. Tom Hanks plays Paul Edgecomb, who is the highest-ranking guard at death row. The movie begins with a new prisoner (Michael Clarke Duncan) arriving at the Green Mile as they call it, so named after the green floor. This new prisoner changes everyone in the prison- criminals and guards alike. The performances very nearly make the movie. Tom Hanks doesn't have an incredible amount of acting to do (Duncan and Jeter take the main honors in this movie), but as usual he is so honest and real I had no trouble believing him, no matter how outrageous any choices his character makes might seem. I also liked David Morse as Brutal, Edgecomb's second-in-command and good friend. Neither actor is able to steal the scene away from the prisoners though; and I don't think they really try to. If they did, it would have thrown the movie off-balance. Michael Clarke Duncan plays a simple character but he invests him with such passion and honesty that he comes off as real and unreal at the same time- the perfect combination for a movie about the unexplainable. He is perfect as Coffey, and without such a good performance in this role, the movie would have been mediocre. Michael Jeter is also very good and sympathetic in his role as the French prisoner. Doug Hutchison is appropriately sleazy in his role and Sam Rockwell appropriately crazy in his. The way these performances fit together is amazing to watch. Besides the cast, the story is superb. It balances the real and supernatural so well, the supernatural seems to fit perfectly into this world. The movie also wisely does not explain the phenomena- sometimes there are things we just can't explain. I won't ruin exactly what happens, but I will say this: the movie was telling its story well before anything supernatural happened, but when it does happen it feels right, and you know you're dealing with a movie that has all the trappings of achieving greatness. However there are certain scenes that feel awkward to me. The scene where Paul invites the other guards to dinner and then forces them to decide what to do seemed contrived to me, as did the entire prologue to the movie. Even so, I really liked the movie and the epilogue is so satisfying and it completes the movie so well, I'm willing to put those scenes aside and wholeheartedly recommend this movie. It's quite a story, and deserves to be heard by anyone who loves movies.  "
50683,tt0407887,abum190,united states,9,Best movie of the year,"The very beginning of The Departed struck me as very similar to GoodFellas. It begins with a boy telling of his first experiences with the mob. The locale even seemed the same. There are other instances in the movie where Scorsese seems to allude back to GoodFellas, a movie many consider to be one of his masterpieces, but in my opinion I think The Departed is all its own and even exceeds GoodFellas in quality and profundity. And besides that, it's also incredibly entertaining. The movie has been advertised as a thriller, and it succeeds at that very well. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Billy Costigan, a cop assigned to not be a cop ever again; instead, he will be a plant in Frank Costello's (Jack Nicholson) outfit. Matt Damon is Colin Sullivan, a cop who works on the side for Costello who entrusts him with the job of finding the mole in his gang. Scorsese weaves an intricate tapestry of deceit and mistrust with bloody and jarring violence mixed with intense scenes where the various disguises are on the verge of being uncovered. It's a very entertaining tapestry; nothing is for sure, and while that could have been frustrating, Scorsese involves you so much in the characters that you understand that when you're wondering if Billy or Colin is lying, they're wondering the same thing. Exploring themes like family and identity and loyalty is not new hat for Scorsese. He contemplated the same ideas in GoodFellas with his depiction of the life of a mafia man. But in The Departed he takes it a step farther and asks the question of what happens when you lose that identity and pretend to be someone you're not. This opens up opportunities to discover what happens to the characters' relationships in these circumstances. Scorsese was blessed with an amazing cast to help him in this task. Leonardo Dicaprio gave an amazing performance two years ago in The Aviator, and while I think that may be his better performance, there's no denying the power and truth in his desperately soul-searching undercover cop. He deserves another Oscar nomination for this, but he probably won't get it because Jack Nicholson is getting most of the notice (not all of it good) for his performance. Some critics are complaining that Nicholson went over the top; I don't think so at all. Everything he did was appropriate as the ultimate kingpin of the Boston mob because his character can get away with anything and knows it. Matt Damon has the least to do of the three of them, but Damon is a good actor and is no less than that here. Vera Farmiga has a good stint as Damon's love interest and Dicaprio's shrink; the lack of identity for both Damon's and Dicaprio's characters has a tasking effect on her and she holds her own against the two men. There's no doubt in my mind that this is the best movie of the year. It has by far the best ending to a Scorsese movie out of the three I've seen. The profundity and inevitability of the last few scenes is perfect. If only the Academy would agree. The only true contenders against it so far for the Oscar are Babel (not as complete as this one) and The Queen (which isn't as big or brawny as The Departed). Besides, Scorsese has been ignored for far too long. This would be a very appropriate time for him to win, and with this movie he would deserve it. But Oscars aside, I would recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates thrilling stories with meaning behind them. Those kinds of movies are few and far between, so grab onto this one and keep hold of it while it lasts.  "
83125,tt0086879,abum190,united states,9,A mesmerizing movie,"Does it really matter that it's not entirely historically accurate? For one thing, this movie isn't about history- it's about passion and genius. For another, I saw this movie knowing that it wasn't completely true to life, but I loved it anyway. Because what really matters is how Hulce and Abraham draw you into their characters, not permitting your eyes to leave the screen. What really matters is the fact that the movie is very entertaining in its own right- with its humor, both dark and light (I laughed every time Mozart laughed, and then even at Mozart's dad's mask), along with a witty and quotable screenplay (""I may be a vulgar man, but I assure you my music is not""). What really matters is how Forman combines everything to really show us the passion Mozart had for his music and how Mozart was a touch above Salieri when it came to music- Salieri could recognize how extraordinary Mozart's music was but could not create it himself. My favorite scene is when Salieri helps Mozart write the end of his mass. Forman wisely does not distract with anything extra and simply shifts back and forth between the two characters, allowing the actors to do their work with their faces. When I was watching this movie again for the second time, I had forgotten about that scene, and watching it again, I could not take my eyes off the TV. In fact, I think I had that problem for most of the movie.  "
89835,tt0053604,abum190,united states,9,One of the most creative ideas for a movie ever,"I wish I had come into this movie not knowing what happens, because I have a feeling I would have enjoyed it even more. As it was, I still loved it. The idea on which this movie is based is so clever, it's hard to understand why they hadn't made it before. A young man named C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) allows the executives of the company where he works to use his apartment for pleasure, usually with women other than their wives (figures). While this is going on, Baxter finds he is in love with a certain elevator girl at the company named Fran Kubelik (Shirley MacLaine). I'm going to go ahead and stop there so I don't ruin anything for you. The plot is too creative to waste in a comment. It is hard to pinpoint exactly why The Apartment succeeds so well. Perhaps it is because the characters ring so true. This is the first movie I've seen Jack Lemmon in, and I have to say I like him a lot. He manages to be funny without breaking away from his character, something I admire in the actors of the Golden Age and something the actors of this age need to learn. There was not a moment in this movie when I felt like Bud wasn't doing what he felt was the right thing. In fact it seems to me like this movie is about Bud and Fran discovering what ""the right thing"" actually is. Fran is played by Shirley MacLaine in what could have been an over-the-top, whiny performance. MacLaine manages to turn Fran into a wonderfully sympathetic and strong-willed woman, despite the fact that she's stuck on the wrong guy. Fred MacMurray has a nice turn as a man who never quite understands the girl he brings to Baxter's apartment, and ends up selfishly pushing her over the edge. Of course, Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond have written such a witty and character-driven screenplay, it must've made the actors' jobs easy. This is more than just a comedy, and while at first glance it seems to be very simple, the more you think about it, the more you realize how much is really there.  "
96072,tt0105695,abum190,united states,9,Exactly the kind of Western you expect Eastwood to make,"It's a Western for sure, but a quiet one, and one that focuses more on the characters than the clich«∏s of the genre. It's the kind of film Clint Eastwood was destined to make after the movies he had made in his past, and it stands alongside Million Dollar Baby as one of his masterpieces. Clint Eastwood plays William Munny, a former drunkard who had a knack for killing people. He now lives on a pig farm with his two kids, clean and good after meeting Claudia, his wife and the woman that made him change. One day the Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett) comes looking for him to ask him to be his partner in killing two men who scratched up a whore in the town of Big Whiskey. William needs the bounty money, so he goes with the Kid and Will's old partner, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman, in a simple, touching performance). Gene Hackman plays Little Bill, the sheriff of Big Whiskey, who doesn't stand for assassins in his town, and Richard Harris plays English Bob, an assassin who gets on Bill's wrong side. The movie would stand fine on that plot alone, but Eastwood adds so much more into the story. His characters transcend any preconceived notions we may have had about their Western origins and they become real people. Things happen that we aren't expecting, because this movie is more than a Western. It's Eastwood's condemnation of violence and it takes an engaging screenplay that slowly reveals its purpose to really bring that across. After seeing The Searchers a few weeks ago and being slightly disappointed in a movie that is widely regarded as a classic, I was a little tentative going into this one. I had no reason to be. It's everything you want it to be and more.  "
127808,tt0395169,abum190,united states,9,Powerfully emotional and inspiring,"I look back on this movie and I find myself realizing that it was one of the most moving movie's I have ever seen. Not that I've seen an incredible variety or astonishing number of movies. But I do know that I am a relatively average 17-year-old who loves movies and I was inspired by this movie in a way only a few other films have. Don Cheadle, a Best Actor Oscar contender for 2004, gives his all to his portrayal of Paul Rusesabagina, a hotel manager that sheltered hundred of refugees during the Rwandan genocide of 1994. Hotel Rwanda is more about Paul's story than the massacres in general, and that's not a bad thing. Seeing this catastrophe through the eyes of a man in Paul's position means that we are party to key figures: a U.N. Colonel (Nick Nolte) who wants to help but is constrained by the limits of his orders, a spoiled general (Fana Mokoena) who provides military protection for Rusesabagina's refugees in response to flattery and bribery, and an American journalist (Joaquin Phoenix) who delivers one of the key revelations of the movie: ""I think if people see this footage, they'll say 'Oh, my God, that's horrible.' And then they'll go on eating their dinners."" Africa is too far away for it to be of any concern to people like us. But all these characters take back seat to Paul in the narrative; they occasionally provide obstacles, such as when the general refuses to give any more police support until Paul bluffs desperately, but the movie belongs to Paul and, inherently, to his family. Don Cheadle plays Paul as a man whose family is more important to him than anything else; his first and foremost concern is for his wife and children and there are moments where he must choose between them and the other Rwandans in his care. His wife, Tatiana, is emotionally played by Sophie Okonedo as a compassionate woman who, even as strong as she turns out to be, feels she needs her husband in order to survive. The love between Paul and Tatiana is one of the anchors in this movie, and thanks to the screenwriters and Okonedo, Tatiana is just as well-developed a character as Paul. While Hotel Rwanda may focus in on this one man and his heroism, the movie manages to skillfully indict the outside (white) world for not taking the initiative to interfere in this conflict. The question of whether or not we could have done anything is moot in this movie; when faces as human as these are painted onto the problem, it seems like we at least should have done something.  "

The story sounds ludicrous if slightly charming- Dorothy, a young farm girl, gets caught in a tornado with her dog Toto and, when the storm finally sets her house down, finds herself in the magical land of Oz where she meets the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion, all of whom look strangely like the farmhands that work with her aunt and uncle. Dorothy is sent on a journey down the Yellow Brick Road to Emerald City to find the Wizard of Oz whom she is led to believe will help her get back to Kansas. Apparently, L. Frank Baum intended it as an allegory to the politics of the time, but I can't see why anyone would care about that when the movie stands on its own two legs just fine. I think the main reason it works so well is that there is never a feeling of ridiculousness throughout the entire movie. Oz is strange, but it's meant to be strange; it never feels completely unrealistic though. I think this has something to do with the contrast provided by the Technicolor applied to the film when Dorothy is Oz and the sepia look when Dorothy is in Kansas. Oz is a different world, but not an entirely unreal world. Our dreams may be larger than life, but there is always something very real about them. Maybe that's the special allure this movie always has for me. Oz is real in this movie. There's never a sure explanation of Oz as Dorothy's dream, but there might as well be. And when I dream, I want to escape into that world because sometimes it's more exciting and better. Dorothy's world is drab, and Oz helps her to see the good in it- the color in it. Metaphors aside, The Wizard of Oz is a fun movie. Somewhere Over the Rainbow is one of the best songs ever recorded, and many of the other songs in the movie are memorable. Judy Garland is obviously not an amazing actor, but her na«Óvet«∏ makes her performance very true and it's near impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. It may be hard for me to establish exactly why The Wizard of Oz has remained such a classic, but there's no difficulty in saying that it is truly a great movie.  "
144144,tt0088247,abum190,united states,8,"Ah, Ahnold","He's buff, stone-faced, and genuinely scary in this movie- my first thought at the end of this movie was ""He'd make a good governor of California."" Well, perhaps not. But it's hard to imagine The Terminator without Schwarzeneggar (I attempted to spell it without looking), and maybe that's only because the Terminator and Arnold have become synonymous since 1984. You can't think Terminator without thinking ""Ah'll be back."" Of course, I wasn't even born in '84, so I don't really know how the movie was received before he became a cultural icon, but from the perspective of a 16-year-old here and now, I think it's a great movie. When you ignore the fact that now Ahnold is and always will be the Terminator, you can see that he really was good in the role. Sure, there isn't much for him to do- he talks in monotone, glares, and flexes- but his build, his accent, his face, everything about him was built for playing a robot- excuse me, cyborg. Kyle Reese would yell at me for being so glib. The hero of the movie, the aforementioned Kyle Reese, is played by Michael Biehn, who has a few shining moments, but doesn't really impress for the rest of the film. Linda Hamilton, on the other hand, shines throughout the entire movie as a young woman whose entire life turns upside down. She doesn't do the girlish freakout, a clich«∏ that has grown really old, probably even by 1984; instead, she focuses on the fact that her life depends on every move she makes- while still showing fear. Hamilton pulls that off magnificently, despite a script that throws a few cheesy lines her way, thought she handles the cheese a lot better than Biehn does. I may sound pretty critical so far, what with the cheese and my disappointment with one of the main stars, but the truth is, despite those flaws, the rest of the movie delivers. Some people say this movie has an anti-nuclear-war message- I say, sure, for maybe five minutes. This isn't a message movie- it's a thriller, full of meaty action that really does thrill. The whole movie is basically a chase scene, but the chasing is gripping and creatively laid out. The only other James Cameron film I've seen is Titanic, and with these two movies I can tell that Cameron is very good at engaging the audience in intelligent action. The plot line is as creative as the action with its detailed mythology and harrowing climax. I don't want to ruin any of it though, because it's really a good story. Just see it, and you'll understand. It's a fun movie, and by now has been raised into the classic zone. And after seeing it a few times and not tiring of it in the least, I can see why.  "

They are words that define evil, but are more urban legend than a real experience. Bleeding hearts today are naive to think that evil isn't real. Hitler really did exist, and several other Hitler's exist to this day, all over the world and many in our own country. Those who don't think so should watch this movie (""Hotel Rwanda."")History has already repeated itself and will do so again unless we do something. This movie should be required viewing in schools. It's appalling to me that nobody did ANYTHING to stop this. One battalion of marines could have ended all that. President Clinton did nothing. He could have sent the marines in but didn't feel that would help him in the polls for whatever reason. He DID NOTHING. The United States Congress DID NOTHING. The blood of these 1 million people is partially on their hands. All it takes for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing. Evil triumphed in Rwanda.  "
112432,tt0077416,abundidi,united states,9,After 34 years,"After 34 years, I finally had the nerve to watch this film, and even then, I only watched the last hour and a half. I am of the generation who lived through the beginning, the struggle and the aftermath of the war. I was an Air Force dependent at the onset of the ""Conflict"". My father was a flight line chief in Germany, and was instrumental in keeping the F 105's in top condition to bomb vietnam in the early 60's. My girlfriend's father was shot down and became a prisoner of war only to be released years later a broken man. I saw the evacuation of Saigon on television. I dated vietnam vets who one even to this day, have nightmares and flashbacks of the carnage they experienced. One who is 61 years old, was spat on when he returned from the war by a anti-war college student, and called a baby killer. I didn't watch this movie when it came out, because I heard it was an authentic portrayal of the war, and it was. It was gripping, well acted and disturbing. Just like I knew it would be. The acting was top notched. The scarred bodies and psyches of the soldiers was authentic. The effect was disturbing. I fight back the tears as I write this. I score it a 9 only because I did not watch the whole film. I think about how only recently the President finally welcomed these boys home, 37 years after the fall of Saigon. This movie is a true depiction of war. Not pretty. Not heroic. Scarring. Hurtful. A shame. And yet we still wage it. Welcome home boys.  "

56087,tt0209144,abw8008,united states,10,Unique," I knew nothing about this film when I arrived at the theater. I was in the mood for a film & it was still early bird price. I was debating this & another that was available when a girl who just bought a ticket said it got good reviews, so I decided to try it & I'm glad I did. This is the type of movie that you don't like or LOVE! But it definately has an effect. I've never seen anything quite like it. I wasn't sure how to rate it. There have been various films dealing with some sort of memory problem but this one is unique. Immediately we are introduced to a the central character whose mind is swiss cheese when I left the theater I felt like my mind was swiss cheese. (One really gets a reality of living in this guy's shoes just from the way the movie is presented.) After giving it some thought I decided it was near perfect as an art form of what was being communicated: The title fit it perfectly; beginning & ending perfect. The critics seem to me to miss the point. We're ushered into his state of mind. Of course, it's cold; there's no memory to give it depth or meaning. Any inconsistencies just add to the effect. Just sit back & experience it. The progressions of clips work. (I think it would be hard not to spin in editing this film.) This film requires all of your attention so I'm glad I saw it in the theater rather than waiting for the video release. I saw this alone & many of the comments say go with friends; you'll be discussing it for quite a while afterwards. This probably good advice. I find myself hungry for comments from the IMDb users.

59991,tt0057012,abxy6000,canada,10,my favourite film," Stanley Kubrick is my favourite director of all time, and if he had made this film alone he would still be in my top 3. This movie is the best ever, it manages to take a topic is black as nuclear war, and make it hilariously satirical. It takes satire, and combines it with some all out silliness. It captures the characters (although quite exagerated) perfectly, and makes you think that these people were really experiencing a cold war. The suspision and parinoia of general Ripper and general Turginson are portrayed perfectly by Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott, and Peter sellers is perfect in all 3 of his roles: As captain Mandrake he manages to be Neurotic, yet occasionly pompous, as President Muffley he manages to seem worried yet sometimes over confident, as Dr. Strangelove he manages to be insane, and in all 3 he is all out hilarious. This film is the high point of cinema whether you think it's funny, smart, or all out insane.  "
15652,tt0167260,abyboom-1,singapore,10,Masterpiece is an understatement.," ******* Might contain spoilers******** When the ""Fellowship"" came out 3 years before, I was not at all hopeful for it's quality. I had seen many a movies inspired from famous books, and frankly barring the ""Godfather"", I had been disappointed in each one of them. Especially, since around that time, the first ""Harry Potter"" was realised, which made a mess of such a brilliant story, though it was a simple one. Tolkein's LOTR was of course, much more complex a story than many I had read. The core subject matter maybe simple enough, but the descriptions of ""Middle Earth"" , characters, incidences, battles and everything encompassed, makes the book a very complex, but hugely effective one. So, I had very little/no hope for Peter Jackson's ""Fellowship"". However, after watching ""Fellowship"", I just realised how wrong I was in my assumptions. The movie not only stays true to the storyline most of the times ( a thing not found in many films adapted from novels!), but it also effectively made me feel what Middle Earth looked like with ease. When I re-read ""Fellowship"" again after watching LOTR1, I realised what Peter jackson has actually achieved is something near perfection. The story starts from the defeat of Dark Lord Sauran, who with the help of one powerful ring wanted to rule the whole of Middle Earth. The ring then gets lost from the face of the earth, to be retrieved much later by Smeagol. Smeagol's life is totally destroyed by the power the ring exhibits on him, and the only thing that makes him go, is the desire for the ring, which he both loves and hates. However, after a series of incidences the ring finds itself in the hands of a hobbit named Frodo. Frodo decides to destroy the ring, since Lord Sauran whose spirit had survived, was organising an evil amry to regain the ring again. LOTR (in 3 parts), describes this journey of Frodo and his friend Sam. During the journey, they are assisted by numerous friends who want the ring to be destroyed for the good of Middle Earth,and foes, who are trying to kill them to get the ring. The journey encompasses courage, cowardness, betreyal, freindship and redemption. Getting the story in a movie was one huge task, and Peter jackson succeeds with flying colours. The fellowship deals with the group destined to destroy the ring and it's ultimate sepration in the face of it's foe. The next two films namely the ""towers"" and ""return"" deals with two separate journeys. One being made by Frodo and Sam, for destruction of the ring, while the other traces the rest of the group fighting battles with the dark lord and it's allies. Some liberties have been taken in the film to make it a bit different from the book, but they are worth doing so. The one liberty that stands out is Gollum's sciznophenic nature. It's a pity that the academy didn't recognise Andy Serkis's achivement, treating it completly as a CGI, but people will know better. Also, it's a pity that the first two parts of the trilogy didn't get the recogniton that they deserved from the academy, for frankly, no other movie came as close as the LOTR's for the last 3 years in terms of perfection in every department. However, the greatest achievemnt of the LOTR films barring thier superb special effects, epic battle scences and scenery comes from the fact that every character was developed so that the audience can relate to them. And there were quite a few of them. In the ""return"" when everything was in place, Aragon says to the Hobbits : ""My freinds, You bow to no one"". And then everybody in the assembly bows in front of these unlikely heros of Middle earth. Well, all I can say is that Peter Jackson deserves a Bow from all the movie lovers, young or old, for making something more than a masterpiece.  "

129633,tt1130884,abychristy,india,10,Brilliant,"Before seeing this, I knew I was in for a treat, given that it's a Scorsese movie, but Shutter Island was even better than I expected. I was skeptical walking into the theater, wondering if this twist could hold water. The film starts with Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck, standing on a ferry. They talk about their assignment. What's suspect here is that there is no additional development. We are bam, smack right into the story without so much as an opening montage. All that we see is the men smoking a couple cigarettes. Though this is what begins as momentous development. As our hero smokes we that this isn't the glorified top lit smoking of a beauty or that of a sophisticated and confident gangster. We see that this is a harsher character with poor posture, someone who doesn't sleep well, someone with a deep past∂? They are greeted at the gate by guards whose attitudes' seem immediately suspect. Soon we meet Dr Crawley, a seemingly complex and modern man who runs the asylum. However, he soon turns uncooperative with the investigation. Inmates and staff are hiding something but what? Everyone here seems off. Evidence and clues begin to appear but not before our hero seems riddled by psychosis himself. ""You act like all this madness is contagious."" Daniels says to the guard. Is it? Soon we begin to wonder, too, but not before he uncovers the tip of the iceberg and it's not only painfully intimate with his own past but also a mass conspiracy. The Nazis had concentration camps and the Americans have Shutter Island. Though, it doesn't stop here, but to say anything else would do the story injustice∂? Kingsley is in his finest role in years. Similarly, DiCaprio reaches new levels. Amongst others Elias Koteas, Ted Levine, Michelle Williams, all play small but wonderful roles. Robert Richardson captures a world all of its own. While Scorsese is a master of film I'd say that his specialty has been more character than story. This is a fresh balance of both. It's a mix of noir and thriller. It's only sort of a horror movie and could be compared to ""The Shining"" but it makes it look like it's a one trick pony. All this praise being said it's not for everyone. The story is complex. It takes some attention. At times it's a bit bleak and dire. Of course it all makes a little less sense when you actually think about it but then again that's film. There are a couple of moments where the story gets lost within itself. Things become a bit too complicated. At this point you might begin to lose faith in its viscosity, but don't worry because the story has you right where its put you.  "

Great, great film. I'm not entirely familiar with the story of King Lear, but I thought ""Ran"" had a wonderful story with all kinds of layers. It was almost overwhelming for me at times as I was trying to keep up with all the various character names and motivations. The photography was so lush and colorful as well, probably the best-looking Kurosawa film I've seen to date. Then again, this is the first one I've seen in color. The framing of shots, the scope and scale, all of it was just so.....magnificent. I love huge epics like this which have so much to them in regards to subject matter; this one deals with loyalty, family, and the bloodthirsty nature of war, among other things, and in the sort of poetic way that would make Shakespeare proud. The battle sequences are stunning and somehow manage to be beautiful and brutal at the same time because of the way they're filmed and the use of music. The score is very haunting; I thought it was used best in the big battle scene towards the middle of the film which causes Hidetora to go mad. I was even smiling during it because the execution was so breathtaking; the type that makes your eyes widen. And the opening set the mood extremely well; I knew from that point on I was watching a film that would instantly become a favorite.

Unlike most films I've see lately, where I can see the ending coming miles away like a freight train barreling down the tracks blowing it's horn, this movie's ending completely threw me for a loop and left me feeling a little betrayed. However, any movie that can invoke an emotion other than cheap laughs or ""oohs"" and ""ahs"" at the pretty CG action sequences is impressive. Josh Brolin plays ""Llewelyn Moss"" who is a simple Texas welder who lives in a trailer with his wife, and stumbles upon a fortune in a botched drug-deal while hunting in the Texas hill country. Although it's ill-begotten gains for Llewelyn you sympathize with his character and you really find yourself hoping they can better their lives with this money and maybe move up to a double-wide trailer or something. Then comes ""Anton Chigurh"" played by Javier Bardem, who Llewelyn refers to as Sugar, the main antagonist in the movie, a psychopath after Llewelyn and the money. Wielding an oxygen-tank-air-gun-type thing that blows deadbolts and doorknobs off, and a shotgun equipped with a silencer he is easily my favorite character.

51512,tt0407887,ac4aq,united states,2,An utterly depraved production.,"The Departed is the film which sets a benchmark for depravity in a production by a major motion picture studio in that it amounts to little more than star-studded snuff porn. It features filthy dialogue, completely implausible when spoken by disciplined law enforcement officers in an open forum. It includes murder by gunfire ad nauseam, not unlike viewing the Zapruder film of the assassination of President Kennedy a dozen times in swift succession. The script is mechanical, the plot turns are shocking but certainly not surprising. The development of the characters is poor, just the usual suspects. On the lighter side, the demise of Det. Queenan (Martin Sheen) provides comic relief, falling to his death in the manner made famous by Wile E. Coyote in numerous animated short subjects, all that's missing is the whistling sound effect. Regrettably Queenan is not indestructible and is not resurrected in the next scene. What remains to me the greatest shock of all is that this feature release won several awards, including Best Motion Picture of the Year! It must have indeed been a vast wasteland in Hollywood in 2006 for this can of raw sewage to be so voted. I must look in the almanac and see if Private School (For Girls) won Best Picture in 1983, as it certainly was a more deserving production. Folks, life is short.

Hitchcock had just finished his television series and obviously had learned something new about BW film making. (And this from the director of many fine BW films including Rebecca.) Too bad that Psycho was his last BW film. Be sure to watch the ""Lee flees by auto"" sequence with the sound turned off at least once to aid in understanding the enormous value of Bernard Herrmann's all string film score to the tension of the film. (the same should be done in the ""Stewart stawks Novak by auto"" sequence in Vertigo- again to Herrmann's score.) I think a compelling case can be made that Herrmann's association with Hitch brought his films to a new level during the Rope to Marnie period. (Spoilers to follow.) Keep an eye out for the foreshadowing here. Wiper blades in Lee's car and the knives on the wall (the only diagonal props) at the hardware store pointed at Arbogast's head from two different angles!! I haven't seen this mentioned in any of the literature about the film, perhaps because the knives pointing effect is so obvious that it is hard to call it ""foreshadowing"".

138433,tt0120382,acab-75700,united states,9,Satirical analysis,"This movie in my opinions is an example of Horatian satire. It plays off of two human follies, the want to control everything and our interest in things we have no business knowing things about. It uses deflation to make the incessant need for control seem normal by making it a TV show that everybody watches and also inflation at the same time by controlling every aspect of a man's life. But this also displays another human folly by showing that people often have an interest things they have shouldn't know about just because they are human and that is just a part of human nature. This is still prevalent to today because these issues are part of human nature and likely will never go away but people might eventually learn to control themselves and suppress these aspects. But in all this is the message that humans are messed up beings that we all have our faults and that we will never change.  "

It is a good reminder that you have to be proud of yourself. One must acknowledge what one has accomplished in order to protect one's passion and sanity for the arts.

The member of the team to carry out this difficult mission makes the most of their own ability and character. The main story is Cobb's love story, and the massage of this film is that no matter dream or not, people want dream come true. If you have same idea, you should watch this movie. Some people compare with this movie and ""matrix"", but the most different thing is this film explains about the dream at the first time. So, I think comparing is nonsense. The ending is interesting.

King George VI was bothered by a stammer. Bertie engages the help of an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue. If they did not meet, not only their life changed, but also the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is different from now. This is interesting more than usual fiction movie. This is the royal story, so we do not understand their real situation. But this is also a family drama, such as coercive parent control their son. It assumes a new aspect of royal family. This story exactly shows the brother romance and family love. And more over, I think this movie has great meaning. At the point of a social issue, a stammer was taken by most media because of their fun. So, showing a story of a people who encounter many difficulties and conquer the problems is significant in the world. I know the part of the reasons why this movie has a high value. This movie has been a great help to reduce people who conceive a prejudice against having difficulty person. I like this movie.

If this is what the world thinks of now as human emotion, I feel sorry for the future. It is at best comic bookish. I assumed it was based on a video game because the characters are so hollow and story void of any real human emotion. I can appreciate the stylization of some of the scenes, particularly the fight scenes, and the winter forest scene at the end, and some of it is interesting to look at (after all, I made it through the whole stupid thing), but in the end I didn't care at all since there was not one redeemable quality in any of them.

But it's too much American dream to take in for me. I realized that the Batman trilogy was made great because of the Joker. That's it... the Joker deserved an Oscar for the role in The Dark Knight. Although the last movie continues the ideas from the predecessor, it fails by giving too much American stuff to take in for a neutral spectator. Too many messages of ""This great country of ours will rise again blah blah blah"". Action wise... Nolan delivers again, but the Catwoman idea is sometimes pathetic. Conclusion... nowhere near of the quality of ""The Dark Knight"". I watched it just to fulfill my desire to watch the whole trilogy. Good with some popcorn or chips, but nothing more.  "

I instantly fell in love with it. This was my favorite movie of all time, until just recently, when it was bumped down a notch by LOTR. I cannot sing the praise of this movie enough, and so won't bother except to say that this film is superb. The only negative thing I have to say (this is probably what keeps it from being my favorite movie ever), and it involves SPOILERS, * * * * * * * is that this movie should have ended about 15 minutes earlier than it did. In my opinion, this movie should have concluded with the destruction of the colony installation. The final battle, as it appears in the movie, with the heroine and the mother alien is just hokey. You can tell that it has been artificially set up from the very beginning of the movie, with those silly exoskeletons. It's so ridiculous, it pains me. Whenever I watch the movie, I turn it off, before this scene, so as not to ruin it, because everything else is great. End SPOILERS ********* Nonetheless, this is a truly superb movie, and is definitely one of my favorites. This is a must see.  "
46308,tt0054215,Acapulqueno,mexico,10,Disorienting in 1960,"Too many reviewers, I think, overlook one of Hitchcock's most effective and disorienting touches. When this film was released in 1960, Janet Leigh was a major star and John Gavin was an important leading man. Those of us who saw it then watched those stars, Leigh and Gavin, plotting a robbery. They seemed to be getting away with it when, with absolutely no warning, the top-billed star gets killed. With the star missing, and the robbery apparently forgotten, the audience was left in the very upsetting position of having no idea as to the possible direction of the story or the identity of the star. In those days Anthony Perkins was little more than a minor juvenile who was listed in a supporting role. Now anybody who sees the movie, even before the first showing, knows that Perkins is the star, and that original disorientation cannot be recreated.  "

Incredible story with a surprising twist about the ""Chaos Theory"". The CGI is impressive and the dinosaurs moved smoothly and behaved exactly how we thought they would.

The deaths in this movie are very grizzly and brutal, but hey, what would you expect from a shark? The acting is superb, the music is powerful, the fear is sudden and unexpected. It's like Jurassic Park, but with sharks. I know the shark looks really fake at some points of the movie, but still just the excitement and tension going on makes you forget that. And it's not just some mindless horror movie about a hark attacking people, it's much deeper than that. It's a movie about self-conscious, doing what is right, and not succumbing to peer pressure. A very quick overview of the story would be: The Chief of Police on Amity Island is struggling to keep the beaches safe from a large shark, but the Mayor insists that they stay open for the tourists. It's got a lot of ties into other subplots, but it still comes down free of any confusion. This is one of the best films by Steven Spielberg.  "
99298,tt0071315,ACB-6,united states,10,"A classic mystery of murder, politics, and love"," Chinatown is a classic mystery full of twists and turns. Jack Nicholson is a private investegator who becomes part of an elaborate plot to kill the head of the Los Angeles water department. From the start Nicholson knows something is up, and begins to discover a huge scandal. This movie often receives unfavorable comments because the plot can be difficult to follow. The first time I saw the movie, I was very confused. However, after watching it again the movie made more sense. The script is so well written, if you miss one little part of the dialogue you could be lost for the rest of the movie. The movie marks a highlight for Roman Polanski (this is my favorite movie by Polanski), and Jerry Goldsmith (this is my favorite musical score by Goldsmith). If it had not been for The Godfather II coming out the same year, Chinatown may have run off with an incredible number of Oscars. The best part of the movie is how well the movie flows into the final scene. After watching the movie several times, I continually pick out more and more of the symbolism and foreshadowing throughout the storyline. This movie is incredible. Great acting from Jack Nicholson, John Huston, and Faye Dunaway. Great directing from Roman Polanski. Great screenwriting by Robert Towne, and great music provided by Jerry Goldsmith. If you have not seen this movie, put it high on your must see list. If you have seen the movie, I urge you to watch it more than once.  "
102362,tt0050212,ACB-6,united states,10,My #1 movie," So, what makes this movie my favorite? Simple, every aspect of the film is perfect. The acting is incredible, Alec Guinness won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Colonel Nicholson. The Cinematography, which also won an Academy Award, is beautiful (If you purchase this video, buy the widescreen. The formatted version does not capture the Cinematography as well.) The musical score by Malcolm Arnold is great (Malcolm Arnold received an Oscar for his score). The Screenplay is wonderful, and an amazing achievement considering two blacklisted writers were responsible for it. Both Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson won an Academy Award for their screenplay. OK, so much for awards, but the little things make this movie great. There are so many great lines and scenes throughout the movie. The movie never tries to show the Japanese as the bad guys (just the enemy in war), but shows their constant fight to maintain their code of honor. This is the ultimate struggle of the movie, can honor exist in war? The British fight to maintain their honor, and the Japanese try to force their code of honor onto the British prisoners. The movie has a message that should last through the ages. The final scene of the movie must be one of the greatest of all time. I will not give it away if anybody has not seen it, but when you do the final scene will blow you away, as will the movie.   "
83180,tt0086879,acbryan,Canada,10,Cinematic Perfection," Amadeus is cinematic perfection. I admit I have concluded Amadeus to be my favorite motion picture of all time. Start to finish, this film is filled with so much. I will attempt to name just a few of it's greater elements. Firstly, after reading a couple of serious, highly regarded and obviously heavily researched biographies of Wolfgang Mozart, I was shocked and pleased to discover that Peter Schaeffer and Milos Forman had clearly not only done mountains of research to perfect their sketch of this man, but these two men interpolated every little known nuance with exquisite perfection. Thanks to them, Mozart is alive as real on the screen as if he were alive passing you by on the avenue today. True, there are historical inaccuracies, but clearly they meant as artistic liberties, taken to create drama and flow (they demonstrate such intimate knowledge of all the little details that they are allowed to skew the big details). The important point is that the composite picture of this man is a brilliant recreation of real life, to the best of anyone's knowledge. The acting is remarkable. Not only are F. Murray Abraham's rushes unforgettable and poignant, but there are so many apparent accidents with respect to other casting choices. Hulce's uncanny portrayal is exactly as one would have imagined him after reading any of the serious bios, to say nothing of that mad cackle. Tom Hulce, of course, is not a prolific screen actor, but this rare performance is so incredibly strong, it is as if his entire life were tailor-made for it, and his contribution to cinema is as great as any actor's simply with this one role. Roy Dotrice as Leopold Mozart is another seemingly accidental perfection. Leopold is played with the precise mixture of intelligence, love, misery, and pathos to be the composite of how the real man is written about. Once again, it is as if every player had done exhaustive research, conceptualized and made their character's lives part of their own psyche so that they act and react to new situations as if they were that person. As for Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor, he was just wickedly funny. All in all, the acting is simply astounding. The music of Mozart has been selected for the soundtrack by true masters. The pieces used are dazzling and truly encapsulate that dichotomous sense of bliss and horror that Mozart always strove to capture. The music leaves Mozart-neophytes yearning for more, and long-time Mozart fans cheering their favorites. When I first watched Amadeus, I belonged to the former group. I am now proud to say I belong to the latter, and when I re-screen Amadeus, I do cheer and weep tears of joy, bliss and shiver with terror at the marvelous orchestrations. Salieri's analysis of the music is also fascinating, if subjective. The choice of Prague as the shooting location was brilliant. Prague in 1983 (when this film was shot) was still part of the Eastern Block of countries and, as such, was untouched and unhindered by the West. It's cobble-stone streets, cathedrals and tenements all still stood as they did in the eighteenth century, (and in all likelihood, as they did in the fifteenth century) without the desecration of Western-style neon signs, modern architecture or other such telling signs of the twentieth century. In other words, it is the perfect character to play eighteenth century Vienna; in a sense, another excellent casting choice. Together with the flawless costume design, and all the perfectly selected character actors and bit players, the deception is complete. We are all hypnotized into believing we have arrived in Vienna c. 1780's. I love every frame of Amadeus. The plot takes liberties, of course, but that is the very nature of cinema. Besides the above elements, the content is full of rich and substantial themes and sub-themes, leading the audience to further provocation: hatred, anger, mediocrity, the nature of savants, prodigy, beauty, envy, vengeance, the differences between (Salieri's fleeting) form (of fame) and (Mozart's lasting) substance (of fame), and the list continues.

140884,tt0246578,ACbyTesla,united states,1,Don't Get it,"I watched this movie when it came out years ago and thought it was awful, I remember falling asleep during it. But the clerk at my local video store went on and on the other day about how great it was so I decided to watch it again, chocking up my previous negative encounter with the movie to me being too tired or in the wrong mood to enjoy it. So I sat down to watch this movie thinking it deserved a second chance. After all, this movie really has a host of actors I think are great, the Gyllenhaals, Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie, the late, great Patrick Swayze, Mary McDonnell, even Seth Rogen, although his part is minuscule. Well, I'm sorry to say, this movie wasn't any better the second time around. In fact this movie stunk, but I wouldn't say it was the actors fault. In fact all of the actors did a very fine job. No, this movie is bad because of the writing. For the life of me, I don't know what was the point of this movie. Was it teenage angst? The dangers of medicating our teenagers? I'm sure there is some symbolism involved, maybe the creepy rabbit is some modern dark version of Jimmy Stewart's ""Harvey""? The best think I could say about this movie is that its creepy and I can dig that. If it goes somewhere, like in David Finchers, Seven and The Game or even Jacob's Ladder (which I think is a horrible movie with a great ending) No, this movie keeps you disoriented almost from the first frame to the last one. I'd love to try an explain it to you, but I need someone to explain it to me first. I didn't tell the video clerk that I thought it was bad. Why bother? He loved it. It just goes to prove that people like different things. Some people like lutefisk too, but NOT ME.  "

Character development is beyond terrible especially when it comes to Michael Who goes from nice guy who is nothing like his family to sociopath with no shades of grey in- between .

Smaller issues include the fact that Michael seems to have a black eye for approximately a year - either that or he spent about a week abroad in which time he managed to get married. Also would have been nice to know what happened to Connie after getting beaten up by her husband - clearly she must have phoned Sonny I assume.... Did she lose the child ?...

63526,tt0081505,accattone74,united states,10,The House That Stanley Built,"(contains spoilers) The Shining's reputation has only grown over these almost 30 years since its initial release, something true of all Kubrick films I believe. And though I would venture to say that nothing Kubrick ever made could be safely classified as a genre picture, The Shining is almost always, and rightfully so, listed among the top horror films of all time. But Kubrick always found a way to transcend these genres he chose to immerse himself in, whether they were noir, gladiator, (anti-)war, sci-fi, period drama, contemporary satire, etc. And out of his entire oeuvre, The Shining is perhaps the most perfect example of said transcendence, shattering most clich«∏s of the horror genre: the main character is the monster; there's only one murder in the entire film; and lastly, it's never a question of ""who"" or ""when"" in The Shining, but ""why"" (did Jack do it?) and ""how"" (was he also in the past?), which themselves are questions left arguably ambiguous at the end. Its this very ambiguity, one of the most non- genre devices there is, that elevates The Shining to not just the top of the best horror movie lists, but perhaps on to the best films ever lists. For me, ambiguous conclusions make for great psycho-logical film, and The Shining is just that. Released in 1980, The Shining was Kubrick's next film after 1975's Barry Lyndon (his best?). Based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, Kubrick rejected King's own adaptation and instead enlisted the aid of novelist Diane Johnson to help write the screenplay. Many King-lovers decry the script's strong differences with the actual source material, but who cares? Considering King's own at-best-mediocre screenplays, and his disastrous attempt at film directing ∂? the mind-numbing Maximum Overdrive ∂? I have no problem trusting that Kubrick knew how to make a film better than Mr. King. The Shining is, on its surface, a ghost story. A failed, alcoholic, and abusive husband and father, one Jack Torrance, decides to take a winter-season caretaker position at the Overlook Hotel, in hopes that the seclusion will help him to rebuild his life, and also assist in revitalizing his creative juices as a writer. Despite the warnings of cabin fever, and the story of a past murder/suicide by a previous caretaker of his entire family, Jack takes the position and travels to the Overlook, with his mousy, chain-smoking, battered-wife syndrome poster- girl spouse, Wendy. They also have a son, the often bruised yet powerfully clairvoyant, Danny, who foresees the evil, but is powerless to understand or prevent it. Of course we, and the entire Torrance family, soon learn that the hotel is named Overlook because, one: it's what you should do if you ever come across it, and two: because it affords glorious views of Hell. Whether it's a simple case of one man going mad, a genuine haunting/possession, multiple hauntings, or if the hotel itself is an evil and sentient being, we never really know. The majestic and horrifying images Kubrick creates, his nail-biting pacing, the revolutionary steadicam work of John Alcott, and the performances of all three major characters, make The Shining one of the most atmospheric nightmares on celluloid. And something else about The Shining not often said, is that it's the only film starring Jack Nicholson that isn't overpowered by Nicholson himself.  "
25271,tt1375666,Accelr,france,7,"Good, very good but not masterpiece","Good cinema, very good cinema. The movie is built well, played well and very well realized. For me, it presents a major defect: the lack of dramatic art. The movie is during 148 minutes but I think that would have be needed to have one hour furthermore to help the spectators to become identified more with the characters. I find that the heroes of the movie are not enough ""worked"". What I like in movies generally, it is when we have an ultra-precise idea of whom are the characters. In Inception it is not the case. We enter at once the action and the presentation, the psychology of the characters is just touched. I know that all the movies cannot have 220 minutes as ""Once upon a time in America "" where we follow the characters of their childhood in their death but there I find that it goes too fast... In the same way I shall have liked having a thorough explanation on the concept: who invented the ""machine"" which allows to enter the dreams? And when? How Cobb meets to live on this ""business""? I find that this part misses cruelly. Following the example of "" matrix "" which succeeds in making credible a concept so complicated, ""Inception"" should have settled its concept with regard to the current reality. It would have allowed the spectators to become identified better with the characters. Chris Nolan remains a big director but honestly I expected in better especially after ""Dark Knight""...  "

To make the long story short: wife discovers husband has been writing about his decent into madness, husband gets violently hostile and tries to kill his family. Starts off pretty well, but it has far too many flaws to be anything special. First of all, Nicholson plays intense to it's hilt during his introductory scenes so it's impossible to tell at what point he actually goes insane. Second, this was not tailored for Stephen King fans. From watching this, you can tell this was made strictly for fans of Kubrick. The two styles clash and this film is unlike most of King's films because of the mind games Kubrick is always playing with the viewer. Third, it's overlong and doesn't make good use out of the time it has. Except for the opening credits, this film is perfectly skip-able.  "

Scenes that look like they have cardboard sets, terrible photography, wooden forced lines, as bad as any local TV drama special. I guess you can put it down to pastiche moments and leave it at that but it disturbs the flow of the film and I start to notice the production values.

Even brief glimpses of happiness are marred by tragedy until in the end we are left with only tears, death and the half hearted sentiment that friendship no matter how intangible is maybe enough to salve deep scarring wounds. To put it bluntly this movie is a downer. I think that the subject matter may not be suitable to claymation. Claymation usually offers something distracting, madcap, surreal.... but tragic?

Braveheart is a movie that is very hard to watch not only because of the violence and brutality, but also the awful and heart-breaking betrayal. William Wallace quickly becomes loved by the viewer while King Edward ""the Longshanks"" becomes one of the most hated characters in any movie.

Well, in actuality, both of the movies are love stories. As a matter of a fact, 'Rocky' only shows boxing scenes briefly at the very beginning, and of course you know about the feel good ending. Rocky Balboa's mind is on two things. One, he wants to win very shy Adrian's love. Two, he wants to prove himself and those around him that he's not a loser, by going distance with a champion Apollo Creed. All the casts showed strong performance, from Adrian's bum brother Paulie, played by Burt Young to Rocky's tough love manager Mickey, played by Burgess Meredith. And of course, the unforgettable sound track makes this movie even more enjoyable. My only disappointment is that this movie is not in the IMDB's top 250 list. Why? I mean movies like 'Clerks' and 'Matrix' are, but not 'Rocky'??? Rating: 9 out of 10.  "

56209,tt0209144,Ace 212,united kingdom,9,Great and Entertaining Film ... with some crucial flaws.,"Memento is more of an evolutionary film than revolutionary, adding a slightly different dimension to what other films have already done before, such as ""Pulp Fiction"", in presenting it out of chronological sequence, with two different running stories, one going forward in time and the other backwards, relating the story of a man with a memory condition unable to create new memories and seeking vengeance for the murder and rape of his wife. ""Memento"" is an extremely entertaining movie for those that like a film that makes them think a bit, and though many people would regard Christopher Nolan as just using a gimmick of using reverse chronological order to cover up what would be a pretty boring plot,this is a pretty foolish remark as Christopher Nolan designed the whole film specifically so that it could be portrayed backwards, hence no-one should even consider if the plot would be just as good if played in chronological order as the whole structure of the story would've been different to accommodate such a change. However, ""Memento"" still has some major flaws that I feel really hold it back from being a truly great film. Though the film does engage the viewer's interest through the suspense built up before, it would have held the viewer's interest much better if the central character was someone that the viewer could feel sympathy for, making them want to know what happens to him, which would have made the twist at the end far more unexpected. As well as this it can be seen that at the end, no matter how many different answers people may come up with to try and cover these questions up, there are still many unanswered questions with some unsatisfactory answers to others which was not Nolan's intention as he himself said that all the answers should be within the film. But though many other people would describe it as being riddled with plot holes there aren't many, if any, of these, such as the common misconception that he shouldn't even be able to remember that he has Anterograde Amnesia, which is actually untrue as can be seen with real-life patients who have the condition. The acting is pretty good throughout, especially from Joey Pantoliano and Guy Pearce who really perform their roles amazingly well, giving very convincing performances. Overall, the whole movie should serve as a highly enjoyable and novel movie (although some people may find it slightly dull or hard to keep up with, and the main character a bit expressionless), with an extremely absorbing narrative structure and plot that'll keep your eyes glued to the screen, with a great twist at the end that should make it, all in all, a really worthwhile movie.

59188,tt0078748,Ace 212,united kingdom,9,A brilliantly directed and revolutionary thriller of its time,"Alien revolves around the story of a crew exploring space, that happen to bring an unwelcome guest on board resulting in a cat-and-mouse chase in which the crew members try valiantly to save their lives. ""Alien"" was a ground-breaking film that set the standards for both suspenseful thrillers and sci-fi movies. The film in itself may be quite predictable at times and some people would argue that perhaps now it isn't as terrifying in comparison to other films, but it still doesn't detract from how innovative a film this is. Even now, many moments in the film will have you on the edge of your seats with the director bringing suspense to a new level, as well as some iconic movie moments still considered as some of the best ever. The whole film is brought together wonderfully by the acting, especially of Sigourney Weaver, that really put you in their position, and the special effects is also quite amazing for its time. Overall, this is a stunning film that should keep you entertained throughout, despite its relatively simple plot. And though it may be slightly predictable the impact of the film remains as hard-hitting as ever, with this being the most advanced sci-fi horror of its time.  "

Rather it is a Machiavellian story about how you could obtain and keep power. Which would work as well for both libs or cons (and any other as well). What the story tells us, and tells us very well indeed, is that (the) people will do anything to feel safe. So if you (the leader) can make them frightened they will lap milk from your open hand, or more probable, your iron clad fist. If you see in Sutler what you see in Bush, Putin, Blair or any other world leader, well thats OK. But in my opinion thats not the point. The point of this movie is to tell us a story about what scared people are willing to sacrifice feel safe.

While the creators of such movies meticulously contrive each scene to be a tear-jerking, heart-rending epiphany into the human spirit, the makers of Forrest Gump set out to tell what is simply a great story of one man's life, where all emotion is merely an honest by-product and nothing more. The movie's unique sense of humor makes it clear early on how it doesn't plan to take its subject matter too seriously, and when the occasional sentimental scene does crop up, it's executed in a way that is surprisingly not cloying or embarrassing.

With that, he relapses into a state of dream to show us his story, a story of his time with Alfredo, the man who works with the movie projector, and a story of his one true love, Elena. The story also has family elements and we can see the way that the relationship between Toto (the main character) and Alfredo grows from beginning to end.

44721,tt0816692,ace_nair,india,8,"Beautiful and breathtaking, but what is the point being made?","The movie takes place sometime in the not so distant future. Crops have been ruined by blight and the focus of the world has moved from technology to agriculture to ensure that the supply can meet the demand for food. In short, Earth is dying and killing mankind in the process. Former NASA pilot Cooper (McConaughey) is now a farmer living with his teen son, ten-year old daughter Murphy and father. Murphy discovers some strange happenings in her rooms with things being knocked off her shelves and Cooper discovers this to be a message which points him to the underground version of NASA. Cooper enrolls for a mission with 3 other scientist and 2 robots to travel through a worm hole to discover hospitable planets. The first act of the story concentrates on the father-daughter dynamics (Mackenzie Fay does a great job as the young Murphy) and the second and third act of the story deals with interstellar travel and the possible discovery of other humans who were sent by NASA to search for the hospitable planets and how Cooper manages to fight time, space and gravity to get back to his family billions of miles away. I was unaware that Matt Damon was in the movie, so that was a nice surprise when he appeared and after ten minutes I badly wanted him to disappear. The movie runs for over 160 minutes, not that you notice. The special effects are amazing and the worm hole, new planets and the space travel have been created very intricately. Nolan has his signature sweeping camera shots and character build up to involve the audience with his story. I enjoyed the movie but a few things didn't work for me. The core of the movie was food being scarce but beer was plenty. The amount of dust/dirt that was flying around, there was no way to keep anything clean for a period of time ∂? so certain things could have remained on Cooper's farm as it did towards the third act. And the final act has Cooper meeting with his progenies who show no interest in him whatsoever ∂? I mean you would like to hold the hand of your grandfather even if you never met him right? Michael Caine ages beautifully in 23 years (he goes from ancient to more ancient and doesn't look a day older). I would like to share more peeves, but that would be giving away more of the plot. This is a good movie ∂? one of those you absolutely have to watch on the big screen, but it will left me wondering at the end ""What was the point of it all?""  "
127058,tt1979320,ace_nair,india,8,Speed thrills and speed kills!,"Rush (2013) Director: Ron Howard This movie narrates the true accounts of the sporting rivalry between Niki Lauda and James Hunt, F1 racing champions in the mid 1970's. Director Ron Howard returns to his brilliant version as a story-teller after crowd-pleasers like the two Robert Langdon movies and the middling movie 'The Dilemma'. His last real good movie was Frost/Nixon about 5 years prior to this one. This movie narrates the stories of two F1 legends who are not very popular to the post 1980's ilk. I actually read about Niki Lauda a few years ago in a story of guts and perseverance ∂? Niki suffered severe burns when his car crashed in a F1 race in Germany with part of his face burnt off and his lungs damaged with internal burns. However 6 weeks after that incident, he returns to the race track in Italy and comes in 4th place. Just an amazing story. Didn't realize then that I was going to see it in a movie. Howard does a good job setting up the back story of characters ∂? Hemsworth (Thor) as Hunt and Bruhl as Lauda ∂? about their appetite for racing, cars and success. Their initial disdain for each other sets each on the path for achieving racing glory. While Hunt partied, Lauda engineered. The movie explores the dynamics and business of racing, the life of racers, the engineering marvel and the frenzy of the sport. Zimmer's music is outstanding, and the camera work & sound editing is simply brilliant. The race sequences are a stand-out and keep you on the edge of your seat. If you don't know your F1 history then it's even more nerve wracking. In my opinion, the movie focused on Hunt ∂? how he was wronged and how he wronged. But my attention and respect was saved for Niki Lauda who was able to manage his fame and stature in real life. He is truly a living icon. Both Hemsworth and Bruhl give memorable performances and they live their characters on screen plus a fine return to form for our good old Richie Cunningham. :) This is one of the best movies released in 2013.

Ask me the same question and you won't get the same answer. If you want the same answer then ask me what the most overrated comic book/superhero movie of all time is and that's what you'll get. There's no denying comic book movies are the most popular type of movie in the last decade or two with Marvel and their cinematic universe dominating both the genre and the box office and they get a large amount of attention. But then there are movies within the genre that get too much attention. ""The Dark Knight"" is that movie. Now I've never been a fan of batman and dislike has grown because of the countless fanboys on social media making out that he is the greatest fictional character ever created and they always cite TDK as the greatest batman movie and greatest comic book movie ever made. So after talking with a friend, I decided to give it a watch and I was left confused, wondering how people bang on about how wonderful it is and rather underwhelmed by it. Christian Bale's batman was so difficult to understand without subtitles, the action was no different from any other superhero movie and the plot was nothing special. That being said, Two-Face was a good looking villain (better than Tommy Lee Jones' version) and as expected Heath Ledger's Joker was actually quite good, Joker is the only thing to do with batman I like and I've always loved Mark Hamill's Joker and Ledger's was a good 2nd place. As nasty as it sounds I feel a lot of the movie's success comes from the fact that Ledger died before the movie was released (I felt the same about the last ""fast and furious"" movie with Paul Walker), it's a good movie but better than other classic movies like the original ""Superman"" ""Jurassic Park"" ""E.T."" or ""Back to the Future"" as a lot of these fanboys suggest? No way whatsoever. Is it the best movie ever made of it's genre? Absolutely not. Should future movies be more like TDK? There are elements that can be adapted yes but no not every movie should be like TDK. Should the fanboys shut up entirely about the movie? Definitely. "

As in real life, each character has parts that you love and parts that you hate. Ashitaka's impassivity in the face of his fate seems beautiful and noble at the beginning of the film but becomes frustrating, even enraging at the end. Eboshi destroys nature to rescue humans on the brink of destruction. Nobody apologizes for their bias, just like in life. Some critics have accused the plot of being driven by the stupidity of the characters, but this critique holds them to the standards of current US society. Nineteenth century Japan was a society strictly regulated by traditions, traditions that were being threatened by Western incursions into Japan. The characters act the only way that they can act - they do their best in an incomprehensible, unsolvable situation. Personally, I sided with Mononoke, but Ashitaka acts with honor in every situation that he faces. I hope that I would have his inner strength in the face of such problems. Things are not neatly wrapped up at the end. This is only one battle in the war between burgeoning Japanese industry and the ancient gods. The war still rages on in Japan as it does in the United States. Oh, the animation is superb. And, for goodness sake, watch it in Japanese with subtitles.

He stole the show that is what makes this movie a must-see for any fan of Batman. We have just witness a classic film and one that should be the first ever superhero movie to be considered for an Academy Award for best actor for the late Heath Ledger and one for Best Picture.

Martin Scorsese is great and knows how to make an epic film work. I love how the mobsters were all street guys and had lived well, but not like royalty like in the Godfather. Some of these guys lived in regular homes. This showed a side of mobsters having fear that the feds were following them or listening in on their conversation as opposed to the Godfather where they seemed like they weren't worried at all at times. Plus Robert De Niro, Joe Pesie, and Ray Liotta are all top notch names and added realism to this epic tale of crime. Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood and this film is his masterpiece. If you haven't seen this film yet I highly recommend it.  "

However If I had to choose one movie in this decade that stands out as the best one, it has to be American Beauty. American Beauty is a story that focuses on a dysfunctional family living in a suburban neighborhood. Kevin Spacy and Annette Benning are excellent as the unhappy middle-aged married couple with an odd ball daughter who falls for the boy next door who is pretty odd himself, also Kevin Spacy's character falls for his daughter's best friend a wild girl played by Mena Suvari. This is complete with a great story and great music, this in my opinion was one of the best movies that came out in over 20 years and a well deserved Academy Award Winner for Best Picture in 1999 and the best one of that decade.

This movie is just a way of showing what scary things a regular hard working man may see in the late hours of the night at NYC or anywhere else for that matter it just took place in NYC, and he decides he wants to go and clean it up.

Because the plot is so complicated in the way it was presented it took my wife and I hours to figure out what really happened. Credit that to the director for having pulled off such an incredible and original movie. ------WARNING***-----SPOILER AHEAD------------- I have read the last 80 comments on this board and not once did anyone observe that Leonard ALREADY had started his body tatooing before his wife died. In an extremely brief scene at the the end of the movie, Leonard is seen laying in bed half-naked with his wife with a few of his tatoos already on his upper chest. This lead me to the following conclusions. 1. Leonard's wife survived the intruders' attack, though Leonard himself suffered severe head trauma which leads to his handicap. 2. As a result of this affliction, Leonard begins tatooing his body, the results which are seen in the final bedroom scene with his wife. 3. Leonard himself kills his own wife with an insulin overdose and then transposes the deed to Sammy Jarkis. The 'real' Sammy never had a wife according to Teddy. Yet in order to justify his 'revenge', Leonard reminds himself that Sammy was a murderer. 4. Leonard is sent to a mental institution (according to the clues in the official website) and begins plotting the murder of the second assailant in his diary. He then escapes the institution and hooks up with Teddy who helps him find the assailant. Teddy photographs the blood-covered Leonard as a reminder of his nasty deed, knowing full well that Leonard will soon forget and continue his killing rampage. 5. Teddy takes advantage of Leonard's affliction and uses him to kill a drug dealer for monetary gains only to be outsmarted by Leonard when he realizes he was duped by Teddy. Presumably, Leonard will continue his rampage until the authorities eventually catch up with him and puts him away for life.  "

Keanu Reeves returns from exile to star as Neo, a programmer by day and hacker at night. He is suddenly drawn into a rebellion against the matrix, or what we know as the world. Little does he know that he is the one of prophecy, the one who will set mankind free. Carrie-Anne Moss is wonderful in her role, its nice to see a strong female lead who is both sexy and strong at the same time. Her character of Trinity is one of the strongest female role models currently on film. Lawrence Fishburn plays Mephesto, the head of the resistance movement and the one who finds Neo and brings him into the movement. His acting is good, but his presence is a bit dry. He acts a bit overly serious, like he is truly a messiah. He doesnt detract from the movie at all, but I felt he tended to overplay the role a bit. Supporting cast: an A....all strong characters and central to the storyline. Tank in particular, as he was the controller of travel between the ""real world"" and the matrix. You might notice I havent talked much about what the matrix is...lets face it, there are some of us out there who havent seen this yet, and its really difficult to explain...I dont feel like ruining the ""surprise"" of the movie for anyone. Suffice it to say that this review doesnt really exist.. ""The Matrix"" is a spellbinding film...full of rich visuals and wonderful characters. Do yourself a favor and see this one soon 4 1/2 out of 5  "
40219,tt0120815,Ace-38,united states,9,Simply the best," I have read many of the reviews for this movie, as well as listened to my friends at work review this one. First off, I'd like to say that all of you who complained about how this movie dragged in the middle have never been a soldier. Five hours of boredom are suddenly followed by 5 minutes of unrelenting terror. That is precisely what this movie conveyed. Mr. Spielberg has done a masterful job putting you into this infantry unit. The combat scenes are grittily realistic, and not the least bit overly graphic. Got news for you folks, that's war. Everything is realistic and accurate, Dale Dye deserves a major bit of recognition for this. Tom Hanks and his bunch looked like an group who had seen their fair share of battle. Mr. Dye worked his magic to the same level on ""Platoon"". If you truly want to see an accurate depiction of what real war is like, this is the only film to see. Five stars out of five  "
68107,tt0169547,Ace-38,United States,10,Scathing painful look at American dysfunctionality," ""American Beauty"" is one of the few films that not only surpasses it's hype, but was truly deserving of the Best Picture Oscar bestowed upon it. This stunning look at a dysfunctional suburban upper middle class family is often painful, sometimes funny, occasionally perverse, but always biting and very well done. Kevin Spacey gives the performance of his career as Lester Burnham, a man who is basically going through a mid-life crisis. He quits his job, blackmails the supervisor into a staggeringly high severance package and begins to assert himself after years of bowing to his wife's wishes. One evening while attending his daughter's dance team performance at a basketball game, he catches a glimpse of a friend and team member of his daughter's and immediately decides he has to have her. This is simply the best performance Mr. Spacey has given to date, and considering the work he's done leading up to this, that's quite a comment. Annette Bening is Lester's wife Carolyn. A real-estate agent with an inferiority complex about the competition, Mrs. Burnham reveals her admiration for this competition in a drunken stupor. She asks him for advice and ends up with more than she may have intended to get. Possessions matter a great deal to her, and her sex life with Lester is non-existant. Only a great performance from Annette could have been acceptable against Kevin and we certainly got it. Carolyn is every demographically correct woman I have ever met. The only word I have for this is perfect. Thora Birch plays Jane Burnham, Lester and Carolyn's teenage daughter. Lots of angst in this character as her parents and her have grown apart. Little or no communication exist between the family members regardless of her pleas for such. Jane ends up falling for the ""weird"" kid next door, Ricky Fitts (an eerie Wes Bentley) and plans to run away with him. Good role here, good enough for what was called for. Mena Suvari chimes in with her best role yet, the temptress Angela Hayes. A girl who's bark is worse than her bite, Angela relies on her looks and sex appeal to get through life. Mena brings Angela to life, and is very much the lolita who plays bigger than she is. Supporting cast is quite strong, with Chris Cooper and Allison Janney leading the way as Col. Frank and Barbara Fitts. Peter Gallagher is Buddy Kane, Scott Bakula and Sam Robards play ""the Jims"" Olmeyer and Berkely respectively. This gay couple in the neighborhood is actually more lively than the Fitts' but don't figure as prominantly in the story as they do. Director Sam Mendes has created a true masterpiece. Watch it several times to make sure you catch all the symbolism present in the movie, some as blatant as the rose petals surrounding Angela in Lester's fantasies, or as subtile as the red door on the Burnham's home. A Best Picture that was as widely received by the public as it was critically acclaimed. 5 out of 5  "

41492,tt0064116,ace41095,united states,10,The Greatest Western Of All Time.,"Sergio Leone is one of the greatest directors of all time that does need to be repeated, because it has been known now for decades. When it comes down too which of his films is the best. I would normally say ""The Good The Bad And The Ugly"" is his best film. But his best western is no doubt ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". The film opens with a man with no name, but he's often called in this film ""Harmonica"". Charles Bronson one of the toughest true men to ever grace Hollywood pictures plays harmonica. He actually doesn't speak as often as you would think, but I personally think that's his style. Always quiet, with that serious look on his face. Opposite Charles Bronson is Jason Robarts as Cheyenne. I love his personality. He just has a fun time messing with people especially Harmonica never taking him seriously, but as the film continues on, his relationship with Harmonica improves, and he even saves his life, ""In one of the best train scenes ever captured on film"". But my personal favorite is Henry Fonda as Frank the main villain of the film. Frank is ruthless; he doesn't care about anyone except himself. He also hates Harmonica, he has the opportunity to kill him many times through out the film but he doesn't, Frank always keeps you guessing. And in turn Harmonica even saves his life. The final scene is one of the most epic scenes ever. Harmonica and Frank stand off against one another. I don't have a lot of time to mention much more of the cast but I will say they are all perfect. The soundtrack is also fantastic, but you can be the judge of that for yourself. Just to sum it up, with an amazing cast, beautiful soundtrack, and a great director, this is my pick for the greatest western of all time.  "

Then one day I was flipping channels and I came across this movie. Wow! I love this movie so much, because it offers a real, no-nonsense, b.s.-free look at the people who do drugs, their 'friends', and their lifestyle. It offers a reason _why_ people wreck their lives with heroin, and that's something I have never seen before. Excellent character study. Ewan McGregor is a natural in the lead role (it is this role that caught George Lucas' attention), and Robert Carlyle is perfectly cast as Begbie. The rest of the cast falls in line and it works very well. Watch for the description of a high at the beginning of the movie - it is very well done. To sum it up: combine 'Forrest Gump' with 'The Basketball Diaries' and this is what you'd get. Read the book.  "
137278,tt0032551,aceallan,united kingdom,7,Good Attempt,"John Steinbeck's 500+ page novel 'The Grapes of Wrath' is a masterpiece. This film of the book is good but does not reach the books level of greatness. The film just scrapes the surface of the book. It doesn't show the pain, suffering and hardship that the Joads and families like them have to go through. It's not gritty enough and lacks bite. It doesn't show them toiling and sweating in the fields. You never get intimate with the family and the feelings that you develop for them in the book simply do not appear in the film. Also, what happens to Noah in the film? He simply vanishes. In the book we know what happens to him. Certain scenes also sound as if they were shot in a tin studio - I hoped they sacked that sound op!!! Worth watching but could be a much better.  "

Our main character usually has an important job, perhaps a family, an obstacle to overcome through hard work and dedication, a woman or a dream. However, in this futuristic cult classic our main character is a young boy with problems, hideous friends, and violent tendencies. When the eyes of this narrator become humbled by prison and society attempts to leash this brute, we see the contradictory lifestyle completely. He becomes institutionalized, and the system of control and social protection takes him apart piece by piece. This film shows the contrast between complete freedom and lack there of. It shows us the tale of a criminals punishment and the life of a person when littered with problems and boundaries. I love this film for it's originality and spunk. It is visually stunning, and in my opinion, Stanly Kubric's best production.  "

Only to be killed in the end. Many scenes of war fighting with all one expects, such as enemy snippers, machine gun nests and mine fields. The enemy soldier Hanks benevolently lets go in one such scene is one who helps to kill him in the end. Private Ryan, played by Matt Damon, only coming into play in the latter part of the movie, to me some what of an anticlimax, is insistent he doesn't want to be rescued, but chooses to fight to the end; of the movie that is. Admittedly this movie is about the character played by Hanks, with Damon as an after thought. The Pvt. Ryan character could of just as easily been played by a trained chimpanzee for what it added to the overall movie. While I liked the overall movie, I was noticeable disappointed by the Pvt. Ryan character.  "

135489,tt0093779,acebogirlie,united states,10,Endearlingly fantastic.,"Warning: Spoilers may be ahead, mate! I've loved this film for as long as I can remember; it's always been at the top of my 'favorites' list. Viewers have loved this film for nearly twenty years and still find the humor fresh and hysterical every time. The film could be viewed either as a fairy tale romance or satire; or both. The Evil Prince Humperdinck tries to steal and kill beautiful Buttercup from her darling Westley. Handsome Westley tries to rescue said heroine; he succeeds. They quite literally ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after. That's the gist- but you're missing out on a good deal of hysteria and laughter. Every actor in this film shines in some way. Cary Elwes is simply the perfect Westley(readers of the book, you've got to agree, I'm a book fan as well). Dashing and charming, he's lovely. Robin Wright Penn is a lovely Buttercup, with a bit more girl power than the book allows; which can be viewed as great! Very pretty; she's a good Buttercup. Chris Sarandon is hilarious and the perfect Humperdinck. Doesn't the name say a good deal? Chris Guest is cunning and somehow funny as the true villain, Count Rugen. On to the supporting cast, which I could view as shining more than the principals. Andre the Giant is absolutely charming and lovable as Fezzik- I cheered when I saw that he got to rhyme! Wallace Shawn portrays the slimy Vizzini so well that you really don't like him, but want to burst out in laughter anyway. As for Mandy Patinkin- he may beat out Westley for my absolute favorite. Mandy is one of my favorite actors from screen and stage; amazing and powerful on both. His Inigo is absolutely perfect and his comedic timing's quite good. I've always liked Inigo and rooted him on. You cheer and shout as he slays Rugen. Billy Crystal is of course, hysterical. Peter Falk and Fred Savage are an adorable on screen team. I feel like I'm running out of room; so I'll just say that the entire cast is hysterical and wonderful. All in all, this film isn't one to miss, as a cult classic or classic romance. You choose!  "

Her outspoken bravery and support of the Allies during the 2nd World War are legendary. But here years later, she steps up to the Plate again. To take the role of the Deluded woman in complete denial of the evidence was a remarkable thing for her to do. She later appeared in live concerts in Germany and was met with very mixed reactions. Some even spitting at her and calling her a ""Traitor"". It was a display of integrity that we have witnessed very rarely in history. I had the privilege of seeing her a dozen years later in concert in London. The visual impression was stunning, she looked absolutely gorgeous to this impressionable young fellow. I think her contributions and her career have been somewhat neglected in recent years. They shouldn't be, she was really one of the most remarkable women in History.  "

The wife finds the dog at the end of the film, aged and still mourning his owner, she hugs him and weeps and then she too leaves(abandons ) him. Does any dog lover think that these are appropriate actions? To see this poor animal, every winter sleeping under a train in the cold/ frost and ice is very upsetting. Yes, for the emotional tug of the story it works, but totally inappropriate to treat an animal like this. If a spouse was so upset at the loss of their partner, and they wanted to haunt the railway station for the rest of their life to be linked to their lost spouse would you let them do it? To put it in human terms the animal was traumatized and needed love, care and attention. They should have taken him to the train station at the time of the professor's daily arrival and then taken him home, loved him, and made him comfortable. But these people just abandoned him. I admit at the end I was sobbing, but I also was very angered, by this story. Poor Hachi...  "

So brilliant I was angry when it was over. Hugo Weaving, as V, is amazing in every respect, when he quotes Shakespeare, among other great writers, he delivers lines so perfectly, and in a context that is also perfect for each reference.

Alejandro did an amazing job on directing he also did the screenplay which was on the top. Photography was stunning, the camera work is amazing and one camera shoots scenes these days are rare. Acting starting from Leo was phenomenal, not going to start bragging but the dude did an amazing job he was spectacular. This must be the movie that he talks the least than in other movies but still good job done by him on the other aspects. Tom is just confirming that he is a top class actor, if Leo doesn't win anything for this then Tom totally deserves it for supporting role. A nice addition was that comet that I have to mention. Also the end credit which was mixed with Leo's breath was a nice additional little thing as we know masterpieces are achieved on details.

I also got extremely attached to the songs that would have been on the nonexistent soundtrack (except background songs). The Director's Cut added a lot of extremely useful scenes that helped me grasp some of the mystery of the movie that I didn't yet understand (like Grandma Death's book: WHY the world was coming to an end, I didn't know at first). The movie also added a lot of unimportant scenes and used pictures Donnie's eyes that didn't seem to work and mesh with the film. Frank's voice was initially creepy, but the director's cut made it too echo-y. As I said, I was extremely attached to the songs. When I turned on the first seen and heard not The Killing Moon but some other song (which I grew to like, but not nearly as much) I stared in horror. I thought that The Killing Moon fit so WELL with the first scene. So why was this imposter song here? Well, then Richard Kelly put in The Killing Moon. But he put it where Under the Milky Way should have been, a song I also loved. He put Under the Milky Way on the radio during the car scene. So why not just put The Killing Moon's replacement song on the radio? (I mean, I can't even find The Killing Moon at my library, so what do I do now?!) The Director's Cut still added a lot of great features and useful information, but it is not the perfection I hoped for. It made me wonder if I should have maybe just gotten the original. You can make your decision based on how much you love the musical score. (All 80s music, come on, Tears for Fears? It's unbeatable).  "

Before sudden, ear-shattering gunshots ring out, Leone orchestrates masterful moments of long and intense waiting. In the famous 10-minute opening credit sequence, we're left for a long, long time just listening to drips from a leak, a squeaky windmill, a door slamming open and shut, and a fly buzzing. We listen and keep listening, anticipating; anticipating violence or silence or both. And Charles Bronson appear!!!! I loved the end too, with Jason Robards on his horse (i don't spoiled, i can't tell more). And Henry Fonda make the bad guy, a very good idea (in this time Henry Fonda only play the good guy).

I guess I expected too much after hearing how ""inspirational"" it was. I didn't find what I was looking for, the idea of emotions was far too shallow for me.

Like ""The Illusionist"" before it, the twists in plot are not earned but sloppily thrown in, and even worse- boring and clich«∏d,save the final one, which is just stupid. The final scene is so melodramatic, long winded, and ridiculous, I considered leaving the theater- but regretfully chose to stay in hopes of some kind of redeeming quality emerging. The only one found was the long overdue appearance of credits. I'm not biased, I like Christopher Nolan's earlier works- Momento and the under looked Insomnia are both excellent- but his writing, has become very short sighted and melodramatic- Batman Begins was also poorly written, failing to cross the line into either comic book/ graphic novel fictionalized or cinematic realism. The emotional connections in this film are not developed, but like the twists lazily thrown in (particualry the relationships with women). It's the second worst film about magic this year.  "

Truman tries to go on adventures but the under cover actors around him persuade him out of it. In the end Truman starts to be aware that it's all lies. Review: In my opinion, the film is funny and entertaining. The acting was believable and it's a great story line. At the beginning you have to pay more attention to understand what's going on and what's happened to Truman. Ed Harris, who played Christof, was nominated for 3 Oscars as best supporting actor, best director and best writing/ screen play. The Truman Show is a PG certificate and the genre is comedy and drama. Also it was first realised in October 1998 but still really popular and still good quality. The budget of the film was $60 million and the box office takings were $125 million, just from the cinema takings alone, which is a great achievement and great fro the show. It helped that the producers of this show was paramount pictures, a very popular company and it was directed by the amazing, Peter Weir. If you love the big brother serious then you'll definitely love this, however, you don't have to love it as I don't because I still enjoyed The Truman Show. I give this film 4 stars out of 5.

Be specific with this one and use examples.,"I think Mike goes back to get Nicky in Vietnam for a couple of reasons. The first being that Nicky told him one night before they left that he didn't want to be left in Vietnam alone, and he wishes that Mike would come and get him if that problem ever comes up. Also, I believe that Mike seeing Nicky's girlfriend so messed up from the possiblilty that Nicky might be dead made him want to go rescue him. The third reason I believe Mike went back was a sense of companionship. Even though Mike and Nicky had their disagreements they were great friends, both in the factory and at home. They did everything together, from getting drunk to weddings to hunting. The final piece that made Mike want to go back to Vietnam was when he saw all the money Nicky was sending to Steve. He wondered how he was getting all of the money, and realized it must be from a game called Russian roulette. Mike knew that Nicky was mentally unstable from seeing horrific events in Vietnam, and especially from the game of Russian roulette. The sad part of Mike trying to rescue Nicky, of course, is that Nicky is either so messed up that he can't, or he doesn't want to recognize Mike. In Nicky's final game of Russian Roulette he almost recognizes Mike, but it's too late and he fires the gun into his head. -- Alex Chase  "

If you thought this movie was violent, then you should not watch any of Scorsese's movies. This movie should be in the top 100.  "

Did you do anything to stop them? All that most of us would do is feel bad about it. And then we would turn off the TV sets, take dinner and go to sleep. The movie shows the attitude of the world when mass killing is being done in Africa in the communal riots between Hutus and Tutsis. The protagonist, ""Paul"", who is a Hutu himself, is just like one of us for whom his family (which is Tutsi) is the most important. In the beginning he would do anything to save his family and would not even bother about his good neighbour. But slowly as he sees what is going around him he starts to realize. He takes up the responsibility of giving shelter to thousands of refugees in his hotel. He keeps giving bribes to the Tutsis leader. He even speaks to so many influential people around the world. And although he had a lot of difficulties convincing the world powers that they should interrupt, he ends up saving lives of about 1200 people. It is not a feel good movie or anything like that. It is a true story about Survival and Will Power. If you liked Schindler's List, the this may be a notch above but not less. Buy it! http://www.schoolofsymphony.com  "

A thrilling tale about Monte-Cristo-styled revenge. The cinematography was quite, quite good. The screenplay was superb. The art direction for the sets were very good and very Matrixy. However, it was in the revelation scene: Oh Dae-Sue discovers that he has slept with his daughter and thus he scissors off his own tongue as a ""symbol of silence"" that we reach the worst of climaxes. The entire film up to this point was the best adapted manga so far. It had everything that manga offers and manifested these elements in a motion picture. However, the idea that this film, the mystery and the revelation, was based around something as revolting as incest was the real downer. It makes this film ultimately depressing and tragic. It clamps down on any further brilliance and magnificence. Hope for this film disappears into the bloody waters like Oh-Dae Su's tongue.  "

I never found myself bored, not even for a second. The underlying dry humor in a lot of the scenes really made the storyline comical to the viewer (if you understood the humor). I have a whole new appreciation for old time movies and Humphrey Bogart. The dialog was perfect, the characters sucked you in so much that at times I forgot it was just a movie. I also may have been the only person who was thoroughly happy with the unusual ending that in my eyes wasn't predictable. That's the most I can say without giving it away. It had an array of comical and lovable characters that I couldn't help finding myself wishing that they'd have a happy ending. Especially Sam, the piano player, although he barely said two words throughout the film his charisma and cheerfulness in an otherwise very depressed time made him so lovable as a character. Rick Blaine was a strong character that you couldn't help feeling some sympathy for, but his character displayed selfless and humble qualities that made the movie all the better.  "

The shower scene for which Marion is stabbed to death is deemed to be as skill-full as cinematography could get in this time period. The storyline was interesting and served as a bit of a mystery to the viewer. The acting was believable and they could not have possibly cast better actors for each role. The grim and sort of scary storyline stood out to among the films i've viewed from this time period. I liked how it was kept a secret until the end that Norman's mother was dead, although I kind of started to suspect this in the middle. It was unusual for the ""main character"" (Marion) to be killed off so early on, and this came as a bit of a shock to me. And surprises in films are what make them successful as opposed to predictable plots.This film is legendary in the history or horror films and set the bar for scary movies to come.  "

I found it creative that the film started at Kane's death and then went backwards in an effort to show his life journey, while the reporter, Jerry Thompson, searched for the meaning behind Kane's last word, ""Rosebud"". It showed the growth of a man born in poverty who makes it lucky when a gold mine is discovered under his mother's property. Kane grows to be a charismatic man loved and looked up to by many. However his personal life lacks, as what happens to most people who experience such wealth and power. It was a lesson of the things that matter in life. The scene where Kane throws and breaks many objects in his room after his wife leaves him. This scene shows a different side of Kane, and as the viewer I felt a lot of sympathy for him, as though he was looking back on his life wondering if all the wealth was really worth it.  "

Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) was my favorite of the characters. Hit witty comments and hilarious performance of ""Make Them Laugh"" made him standout although he technically wasn't a main character. The budding romance of Don and Kathy can be seen from the very beginning as a sort of Screwball Comedy way of making them poke fun of each other at first but slowly put aside their differences and fall in love. I loved how, especially in the beginning, they sort of make fun of the materialistic norms of Hollywood. The public's obsession with ""power couples"" and the idea of Lockwood and Lamont as a household name. But as the movie goes on Don starts to lose interest in following the Hollywood norms and becomes more interested in giving the love of his life, Kathy Seldon, some credit for her amazing talents as an actress and singer.

The scene where Sam Spade and Kasper Gutman are walking from one room to another, and then down a long hallway then up close to Spade's face then a glance at Gutman's stomach as Spade sees it. This was a very sophisticated camera shot for films of this time.The scenes and camera work were very interesting and distinct in this film. I also really enjoy watching Humphrey Bogart on screen. They couldn't have picked a better actor for the role, he always gets into his characters to the point that you forget you're watching an actor on screen. In the end he makes a decision similar to the one Bogart had to make at the end of Casablanca. it's interesting how the two have such similarities.  "

Its star Leonardo DiCaprio has compared it to the story of the Roman emperor Caligula, and he's not far off the mark. Adapted by Terence Winter from the memoir by stockbroker Jordan Belfort, who oozed his way into a fortune in the 1980s and '90s, this is an excessive film about excess, and a movie about appetites whose own appetite for compulsive pleasures seems bottomless. It runs three hours, and was reportedly cut down from four by Scorsese's regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker. It's a testament to Scorsese and Winter and their collaborators that one could imagine watching these cackling swine for five hours, or ten, while still finding them fascinating, and our own fascination with them disturbing.

Sensitively directed and rarely over-sentimental, this touching parable will likely ravish the emotions of dog lovers.

139283,tt0112471,achraj,india,10,Will blow off your mind....,"Frankly, this is not the sort of film one usually expects to find in multiplexes. In fact, if it weren't in English, it might be possible to mistake this for the work of someone like Eric Rohmer. The plentiful and varied dialogue has a richness that few screenplays manage to capture. Most of Before Sunrise is talking. The characters touch on subjects ranging from language and reincarnation to sexuality and cable access shows. Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy) on a train traveling through Europe. His destination is Vienna, where a flight back to America awaits him the next morning. She's on her way to Paris, where she starts classes at the Sorbonne next week. From their first moment of eye contact, they're drawn to each other. They share a meal in the lounge car, savoring the conversation more than the food, and when they arrive in Vienna, Jesse persuades Celine to disembark with him and keep him company wandering the streets until the time comes for his plane to depart. Thus begins an unforgettable screen romance. One of the first things to notice about Before Sunrise is how completely natural it all seems. Credit both director Linklater and his two leads. The rapport between Jesse and Celine is so lacking in artifice that at times the viewer feels like a voyeur. We are privy to everything, including the sort of ""unimportant"" dialogue that most films shy away from. Here, its inclusion is just one of many fresh elements. Hawke (the American grunge actor who starred opposite Winona Ryder in Reality Bites) and Delpy (the French actress from Europa Europa, White, and Killing Zoe) are nothing short of perfect. For this film to work, they have a threefold task: embrace their characters, attract each other, and connect with the audience. Needless to say, all are accomplished flawlessly. From the first stolen glance, there's never any question about their chemistry, and it takes no more time for the audience to be enraptured by Jesse and Celine than it does for them to fall for each other. Before Sunrise is about life, romance, and love. It magnifies the little things, paying scrupulous attention to the subtleties and mannerisms of body language. There's one scene where Jesse has to restrain himself from brushing away a stray lock of Celine's hair, and another wonderful moment in a music listening booth where the characters nervously avoid eye contact. This film is an amalgamation of such memorable scenes, yet, as they saying goes, the whole is more than a sum of its parts. Questions about fate and the transitory nature of relationships are raised, then left open for the audience to ponder. There are moments of unforced humor, and times of bittersweet poignancy. Before Sunrise speaks as much to the mind as to the heart, and much of what it says is likely to strike a responsive chord -- a rare and special accomplishment for any motion picture.  "

116301,tt0167404,achrya (achrya@achrya.net),sweden,3,Talent's Labour's Lost," ""Sixth sense"" is in many ways an extremely beautiful movie and contains some utterly brilliant acting - for example, the initial scene at the Crowes' house made my acting appreciation organ, whichever one that is, turn somersaults. But... Every fictional story depends to some extent on the suspension of our disbelief in impossible things. A film's ambition at seriousness signals that the suspension required will be relatively small, i.e. that the script attempts to be plausible. ""Sixth sense"" obviously aspires at being a serious psychological drama, so one would expect a rather high level of plausibility. Whether or not you can accept the basic premise, that souls have individual existence independent of the body (""ghosts"") and that they can influence some living people, depends on your own religious standpoint and fundamental view of the universe, so let us leave that aside. But one unconditional premise in a story that aspires at any kind of plausibility is that all individuals of a certain species are subject to the same basic constraints: e.g. people can't fly, fish can't talk, ghosts can't handle material objects... and if the script writer decides to let an individual go beyond these constraints, the audience is entitled to an explanation. WARNING - SPOILER AHEAD! Now, in Sixth sense we find one ghost who can look perfectly ordinary (and even change clothes) while others only show themselves in the state they were in when they died; the same ghost can enter a church, a place where no other ghosts ever show up; he can throw rocks, play audio recordings and take notes, while it's crucial to the story that a ""regular"" ghost can't by herself move a video tape to where it will be found... All this simply because we aren't supposed to know that he's dead!!! And we get no hint of an explanation why this particular individual is Mr. Superghost! Another serious hole in the fabric of the story is the gimmick of people ""not knowing that they are dead"". These people walk about and perceive their surroundings, but they don't notice that there's been a funeral, that their bank account is gone, that they can't get service in a store, that they themselves have stopped eating etc. etc. etc.??? Bruce Willis is normally a committed, thorough actor who does his homework and delivers the goods. Even his superheroes and inhabitants of the future are primarily people, who we know can get bored, have a headache or need to go to the bathroom. That's what makes them so easy to identify with and their stories so compelling. - Now, in ""Sixth sense"" individual scenes are beautifully acted, with a gripping psychological reality, but the plot holes indicated above effectively prevent the film from making sense as a whole. Simply speaking, Mr Shyamalan and Mr Willis are too involved in visual and psychological artistry to care whether Crowe goes to the bathroom, and if not, why. And, what's worse, they expect us viewers not to notice. To quote a more traditional Willis hero, ""What do you think I am, stupid?!"" Obviously, on an artistic level, Shyamalan and Willis work extremely well together. But, for it to become beautiful music, we must hope for a better score.   "
132153,tt1392190,achsaphillippi8,united states,10,What a Lovely Day to Write a Review,"There is hope for Hollywood yet. In an endless storm of sequels and reboots, finally a group of people came together and said, ""Hey, let's make the most amazing entertainment experience of the decade. Let's take Mad Max, and AMP IT UP."" And that's exactly what they did. Ladies and Gentlemen, Mad Max: Fury Road is a movie for the ages. Yes, it is a reboot, but it's probably the best one in recent history. Mad Max and The Road Warrior are enjoyable films. But I think this movie is way better. Mad Max: Fury Road wastes no time with explanations. It's all about the action, and the pure suspense. We understand the setting, the character motivations, and how much the world has changed for everyone without having to sit through a history lesson. It doesn't matter how the Apocalypse happened. It doesn't matter how the main villain Immortan Joe built his citadel. It doesn't matter what exactly happened to Max before the movie starts. All the necessary information is there: The movie takes place is the post-Apocalypse where humanity had no choice but to go nuts. Max is haunted by the innocent lives he was unable to save. Furiosa's goal is to save the oppressed wives of Immortan Joe from a lifetime of being used as objects that give birth to future warlords. And let the madness begin! The plot may be simple, and Max might not be the center of the story, but the movie works. We understand everything that we need to know, and we are able to care because the characters and the setting are so visually unique and interesting. I think the acting was superb, and the shining star was Charlize Theron as Furiosa, the one woman army who drives a truck called the War Rig, and can hold her own in a fight against even Max. She is a fearless badass, but also a compassionate and noble soul; she risks her life to betray Immortan Joe and steal away his prized wives so they can find a better life elsewhere. Also in the mix is Tom Hardy as the titular Mad Max, who is a man of few words. He carves his own path, but will still stop along the way to help the innocent. Another notable performance was Nicholas Hoult, who plays a rabidly devoted follower of Immortan Joe, who insists on driving off to war even though he doesn't have long to live. The villainous Immortan Joe is also notable due to his incredible design and the mystery surrounding his strange cult of freaks, fighting in hopes of being reborn ""shiny and new."" I would also like to note that this movie features REAL vehicles that the filmmakers built in REAL LIFE, along with REAL explosions and REAL fire. If this explanation isn't enough to get you to see the film, then here's a list of other awesome things that are in it: -A great, big, beautiful dust storm with lightning and tornadoes inside it -A vehicle rigged with men playing the drums, large speakers, and one dude hanging on chords playing a custom electric guitar that shoots fire -A man wearing a hat made out of bullets whose teeth are also bullets -Spears that explode on impact -Old warrior women on motorcycles -One beautiful thirty-second shot of strange humanoids on stilts -Lots of stabbing, punching, and exploding -Did I mention AWESOME vehicles that were built FOR REAL? I can't fully explain just how amazing this movie is. Everything about it is so enjoyable, not to mention METAL AS HELL. Go see this movie. Take your wife, husband, girlfriend, boyfriend, friends, your teenage kids! It doesn't matter that it's not exactly like the old Mad Max films. This blew the originals out of the water and into space!  "

67242,tt1345836,Achyuta Ghosh,British Indian Ocean Territory,9,A fitting end,"What makes the Batman so appealing? Essentially a caped and cowled crusader earning his bread by his ability to strike fear, albeit with lots of cash and technology to boot, Batman is easily the most human of all superheroes. Tormented, often ridiculed, and always looking for relevance, he is but an enhanced everyman. The Dark Knight Rises picks up eight years after the fateful events in The Dark Knight, where the Batman lost his love (Rachel Dawes) and also struck a Faustian deal with Police Commissioner Gordon where he disappeared from the public taking the rap for Harvey Dent's death. Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, only to be drawn out into the world when cat burglar Selina Kyles as Catwoman stirs his fancy. Something is rotten in Gotham, though there is an uneasy peace prevalent, for Commissioner Gordon thinks it is the lull before the storm, and he is prophetically proved as masked terrorist Bane explodes into the scene literally. In a thrilling and audacious opening sequence, Nolan sets the tone by orchestrating a mid air kidnapping. The Batman trilogy deals closely with post 9/11 terrorism than any other movie- and here too the context is evident as Bane destroys first the stock exchange, then a football stadium and cuts off Gotham from the rest of the world, throwing it into complete anarchy. He might not be a jihadi and might speak with a cheerful English accent, but comes from a hell-hole in the subcontinent, and is clearly socialist- wants to turn over power to the people, obliterate the symbol of law and order, Batman, and bomb the living daylights out of Gotham. Like a well orchestrated symphony, Bane sets things in motion that create overwhelming odds for the Batman who now has the fight of his life on his hands, because for the first time he faces an adversary that is more powerful than him and staggeringly smart too. Broken, battered and bloodied, but like an All American hero, the Dark Knight rises up one final time for a fitting climax to the best superhero trilogy ever. But Christopher Nolan is wrapping it all up here, so there are strands from the earlier movies woven in. To his credit, Nolan makes a brilliant crime drama playing out of a superhero movie elevating the genre to art with its entertainment quotient intact- grandiose and emotional at the same time. There are soul searching moments, as there is plenty of action along with super-cool gadgets. This movie is as much about ends as about beginnings. Bane is following what Ra's Al Ghul set out to do in Batman Begins- ie. In a world without redemption, destroy this corrupt society so that a new one can take its place. Alfred wishes Bruce Wayne to start a new life, even the Catwoman is running after for a clean slate. At the same time, The Dark Knight Rises explores recurring themes such a) As a villain instilling fear (Scarecrow through chemicals, Joker through random unpredictability, and Bane through brute force), b) ""what you are in the dark""- Bruce always believes the people of Gotham are inherently good, while his adversaries think the opposite, and c) the Batman's desire to save the city at whatever cost. Key highlight of the movie are powerhouse performances by an eclectic mix of actors from whom we expect, and some new surprises. Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Michael Caine as Alfred are series regulars that like wine kept getting better with age. The newcomers are scene stealers in their own right- Joseph Gordon- Levitt as rookie cop John ""Robin"" Blake brings earnestness and gravitas to every scene he is in- a working man hero. And as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Anna Hathaway just blows apart all her previous wonderful performances by getting just the right amount of catty, ass-kicky and supreme sexy. Hers' is the best character in the movie- ethically and morally ambiguous, you really can't help but keep thinking what she will do next. The movie's weaknesses are in a way linked to its strengths- this is a heavy and dark, nay, almost black film with an apocalyptic future that treads the fine line between entertainment and lessons in morality. And even with a 3 hr running time, too many characters do spoil the broth. Comparisons are inevitable, and this one lacks in intensity as compared to its predecessor. The Dark Knight made me squirm in my seat, and gave sleepless nights. I had kept playing myself on one of those ferries with THAT choice to make, and never found an answer. Any comic film is as good as its villain- Tom Hardy as Bane radiates intensity and presence, but now I realize how crucial Heath Ledger's Joker was to the epic-ness of The Dark Knight. To be fair, it is not right to expect Bane with his mask and one dimensional character to come up trumps when up against the insidious Joker, but I did wish for some more swagger and style from the only man that ever ""broke the bat"". Christian Bale as both Bruce Wayne/Batman looked tired throughout- might be what the script required but it kind of felt that he has had enough. He looked like a rubber stuffed toy in that overdone suit, and after building the sacrifice friendly legend of Batman in the earlier movies, shouldn't it all have ended in an explosion in the sea? Was the final happy moment necessary? Oh, but superheroes never die. Mildly disappointing, but maybe I am nitpicking, but only so because expectations were sky high. To sum up, this is a near perfect effort from currently the best movie-maker in the world at the height of his powers. It is a fitting and satisfying end to a blockbuster series which will inspire future generations of movie makers. Easy to say film of the year and a must watch for all- 9/10  "
107038,tt1291584,Achyuta Ghosh,india,10,Warrior is the best movie of the year so far!,"Don't be misled by the name- Warrior is no action movie. It is though, a superlative emotional roller-coaster, inter spaced with the occasional punch or too. In the style of Rocky, this is a combat sport movie, on the lives of two brothers- who set out on different paths that converge in one titanic fight in the ring, and the greatest thing about this movie is that you don't get to pick sides, you root for both of them till the very end. Tom Hardy plays Tommy- an ex-Marine who was a champion mixed martial artist, trained by his father. With the build of a bulldog, he has the personality of a champion too- brooding, confident, and with the capability to finish off his opponents in seconds. But he is also disillusioned, a deserter from the armed forces, and a dipsomaniac too. Joel Edgarton plays Brendan, and he is every bit the proverbial underdog. When he was a kid, his father was never interested in him as he saw more potential in Tom, and we all know how favoritism from parents can make the unfavored sibling feel. And so he always has a point to prove- when his coach tells him that when the moment comes, he will tap out or when his wife tells him that he won't go all the way - it shows in his eyes when he says he will. And yet, Brendan, like most of us, fights best when his back is to the wall. Both the brothers don't talk to each other, and also harbor deep resentments towards their alcoholic father, whom they blame for their mothers death, and for mistreating them. And no one could have played this redemption seeking, guilt ridden yet trying to pull himself together father as Nick Nolte did. In one of the movie's finest scenes, he breaks down in his son's arms reciting Herman Melville, and with that builds bridges too. A surefire Oscar nod for this, I hope. The first half focuses on what all directors aim to do but cant- character development. Little by little insights into the lives of the main characters, what drives them, gives us a glimpse of what drives them towards participating in a global mixed martial arts championship. The second half has some of the most authentically choreographed fight scenes in MMA history, and credit goes to both Tom and Joel for making this look so real- it feels that they have been doing this all their lives, and not only for this movie. Both have contrasting fighting styles- Tom is overpowering, dominating, and attacking, while Joel is fast, stealthy, thinking, absorbs a lot of punishment but gets his foe down in the end- reminds me so much of my childhood WWF hero, Bret ""The Hit-man"" Hart. And the one thing common between the two is that none know how to give an inch. So when the climactic, emotion filled final bout between the brothers take place, one of them has to shout repeatedly to the injured other that he loves him, so that he gives up and the fight gets over.

119615,tt2488496,Achyuta Ghosh,india,9,The Force is strong with this one,"Star Wars: The Force AwakensÉ?? is the Christmas gift we all have been waiting for. JJ Abrams did with Star WarsÉ?? what he did with Star TrekÉ?? - staying within the canons of the franchise and playing safe, yet coming up with a fast paced entertainer that will wipe out all the bad memories of the last three installments of Star Wars. The Force Awakens is basically the same film as the first Star Wars film- A New Hope. There is a deserted planet to start with, along with a mysterious character who does not know that the Force is with her, and of course accompanied with a droid who holds a key secret. The Empire is back in the form of the New Order, the Emperor is back as Lord Snoke, and there is a new Darth Vader in town in the form of Kylo Ren. A beloved character dies at the hands of Ren, just like Obi-Wan did, there is a jumbo sized Death Star, the star-fighters are always the harbinger of good news, and there is a manic pilot to steer things the right way. What makes a stale tale fresh is the treatment. J. J. AbramsÉ?? takes a cue from Marvel's Guardians of the GalaxyÉ?? and infuses The Force Awakens with enough energy and humor to power a few star-killer bases, along with stellar casting, superb editing and excellent 3D effects. Old characters appear not only for nostalgic reasons, but also to take the story further, slowly handing over the baton to a new trio of hitherto unknown but talented actors. The Force Awakens is made keeping in mind modern sensibilities- a strong female character, a colored hero, and second chances. Katniss Everdeen, Furiosa, and Beatrice Prior- bye bye. Rey, played in rocking style by Daisy RidleyÉ??- the story rests of her frail shoulders, and this newbie delivers in fine style. Complementing her is John BoyegaÉ??'s Finn- a storm-trooper who is on the run, and Oscar IsaacÉ??'s Poe Dameroon, the ""best pilot in the Resistance"". Opposing them is Adam Driver's Ren, who is a villain who needs to work upon being more evil. These four characters are Luke, Leia, Han and Vader for this generation. Will they become as iconic as the last generation? Time will tell, but it sure looks promising. The Force is strong with this one.  "
127376,tt1979320,Achyuta Ghosh,india,10,What a Rush,"Rush is Ron Howard's best up to date, a visceral thrill ride. It is an exceedingly well crafted sports drama movie, that focuses on the rivalry between two distinctly different men in the gladiatorial world that was Formula 1 racing in the 70s. ""25 drivers start every season in Formula One, and each year, two of us die. What kind of person does a job like this? Not normal men, for sure. Rebels, lunatics, dreamers... people who are desperate to make a mark and are prepared to die trying""- Niki Lauda It is 1976, Bernie Ecclestone is yet to take center stage, race car drivers are superstars with low life expectancy and all that is worth looking forward to in Formula 1 racing is the competition between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both of them supremely, almost inhuman racing talents, with arrogance to spare. Yet they could not be more different- Hunt's brash style versus Lauda's cool discipline. Hunt's live life to the max philosophy, versus Lauda's switchblade efficiency. James Hunt: The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive. Niki Lauda: A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends. Shot in documentary style, Rush does not seek to establish deep human connect, but instead etches out the story of two diverse personalities competing for the same prize. Whose side are you on? Never mind that because even if you do not understand the difference between motor sports and basketball, or even if you are not a petrol head, you will still be enthralled. Rush is a blur of exquisitely choreographed races, a palette of gorgeous cars and women, a fight for racing immortality between two crazies. Ron Howard has been churning out tripe lately (The DaVinci Code, Angels & Demons). Here is back in form in adrenalin pumping style. The pace is snappy, the editing brisk, the soundtrack is racy, and the dialogs memorable. But the most crucial aspect of a gripping conflict was getting the casting spot on. People would believe this is Chris Hemsworth's breakout role, irrespective of recent past involving Norse gods, hammers and other superheroes. While he is great as the bodacious Hunt, it is actually Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda who steals the show, creating sympathy for a self absorbed, myopic, rude and an essentially unlikeable person. Who was the better racer- Hunt or Lauda? Does not matter. What matters is Rush is an un-missable movie, and hence is, quote WWE's Road Warriors- ""what aaaaa rush""- 10/10  "
155723,tt2015381,Achyuta Ghosh,india,10,Simply Marvel-lous,"Guardians of the Galaxy- Simply Marvellous Yes it is a movie of cosmic proportions, an inter-planetary fantasy of epic scale. Yes it has a team of underdogs taking down a Goliath. Yes it has a talking raccoon and a tree as main characters. But what makes Guardians of the Galaxy the best Marvel movie of all times is the fact that it is the closest embodiment of the Marvel comic book ethos- full of wit and charm, spunk and fun, and of course, action. Sample this- somewhere in the universe, in a desolate planet with incessant water fountains, where a once proud culture reigned. A masked man lands in a spaceship, and charts out a path through the devastated surroundings. At one point, he puts on a Walkman, switches on Redbone's ""Come and Get Your Love"" and breaks into an impromptu jig. He is in some mood. On his way he encounters small dinosaur like creatures that he either footballs them or treats them as microphones, karoakaying his way and leaping across mortal dangers to steal an Infinity gem, as the credits start to roll. Marvel fans would be aware that the stone is one of the most powerful objects in the universe. This effortless boogey sets the tone for the movie- an irreverent take on universe shattering events. Unlike the Avengers, since the characters are all new, but even more bizarre, they do need a round of formal introductions- ""Star-Lord, man, legendary outlaw. Forget it"" - Peter Quill Played in zany style by Chris Pratt, Peter Quill was kidnapped from earth when he was a child by a gang of bounty hunters. Today he is a galaxy trotting thief and space scavenger who likes to call himself Star-Lord. Tremendously attached to his mother's music, Quill is a Romeo who has survived in this cutthroat profession so far solely because of his improvising skills. ""I am a warrior, an assassin. I don't dance"" - Gomora Acted by Zoe Saldana (this time in a shade of green), Gomora is an adopted daughter of Thanos, surgically enhanced into a killing weapon. Gomora is exactly what she says, but learn to dance, she does, courtesy Star-Lord. ""Nothing goes over my head! My reflexes are too fast, i would catch it""- Drax, the Destroyer Played by WWE star Dave Bautista, Drax is a naive to the point of stupidity, suicidal, tattooed mountain of a brute with a love for knifes matched only by his thirst for violence. He specifically seeks revenge on Thanos and Ronan, who he holds responsible for the death of his family. ""Ain't no thing like me, except me""- Rocket Raccoon Couldn't be more true. Rocket is like no other thing. Motion captured and voiced in scene stealing style by Bradley Cooper, Rocket is a genetically altered, cybernetic-ally enhanced raccoon with a thing for sarcasm. Happiest when with a big gun and Groot by his side, he is also a master tactician and the technical whiz kid in the team. ""I am Groot"" - Groot Perhaps the most emotive role ever essayed by Vin Diesel- Groot is an ever growing humanoid plant whose vocabulary is limited to three words. Serves as the muscle for Raccoon with whom he has kind of a telepathic connection. Also in the mix are even zanier characters- Xondu (Michael Rooker), the bounty hunter that trained Quill and was later double crossed by him, carries an arrow that would have changed the course of the Mahabharata battle, the super-villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who we will see more of in future Marvel productions, Lee Pace as the fearsome, maniacal Ronan the Accuser- a Kree warlord with blind hatred for Xandarians, and Benicio Del Toro as The Collector- an ancient alien. ""We are all standing, a bunch of idiots standing in a circle"" The Guardians are an anonymous, friendless lot. They have all been scorned and have suffered loss. Till they come together as a team to defend the planet of Xandar and its 12 billion people against Ronan, they have never known a family. The movie is a VFX extravaganza with superlatively detailed action sequences, but at the same time director James Gunn draws effectively from established scifi franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars to create an emotional and expressive tale, while at the same time endowing it with oodles of self deprecating humor. The script is a belly full of laughs, the soundtrack is as it claims- awesome, and the acting by all, though caricatured, is top class. The end product is a an amazingly imaginative, visually stunning, frothy, lively, light hearted ""save the universe"" romp that wows with its dazzling visual style and at the same time keeps tickling your funny bone. Cannot recommend enough- 11/10  "
157281,tt0848228,Achyuta Ghosh,india,10,"The Avengers- Best movie of the year so far. Fans salivate, non fans- prepare to get converted!","The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated. The Avengers project began over 6 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humor and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all. The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be ""hilariously out gunned"" and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- ""billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist""- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humor to an ""oh so serious"" group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett. You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- ""hold on"", he seems to say, ""the solution is just round the corner""- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colorfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. There are minor flaws, but this is THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR. Geeking out has never been so much fun.  "

But after seeing the Marvel movie, Captain America: the first Avenger, Thor and Incredible hulk- I thought that the movie would be not as good as the hype it carried for so many years. But still due to Robert downey jr. i wanted to see this film. OK, i admit it, i was blown away by the movie in terms of Action, and of course Humor. Director Joss Whedon, directed this movie so BRILLIANTLY, that there are very little or NO flaws. Sufficient Screen time has been provided for each of the SUPERHEROES. but the Mighty guys, Iron man(RDJ) and the Hulk(Mark Ruffalo) steal the show. Thor(Chris Hemsworth) was too, brilliant. In this movie, you'll see more of Captain America(Chris Evans) than his solo movie, which is really great. AND, Black Widow(Scarlett Johannson) kicks the ass off whoever she fights with. Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner) is not at all Underused, his Powers were shown superbly. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) was great with his Initiative. And here it is, the main villain, Loki(Tom Hiddleston), steals the show with his mischievous and No-worries personality, he fits into the role perfectly. On the Whole, the cast were perfect, with each of them fitting into the characters with ease. The humor and witty one liners are splendid. Don't expect it to be DARK with no humor like the Dark knight, instead it wins the heart of each and every person watching the film in the auditorium. Many people have started comparing Avengers with The dark knight, but what I SAY is these two are COMPLETELY different type of film, and comparing the two is not justified. Still if you compare, Avengers is better than Dark knight. Due to the reason that Avengers can be enjoyed by each and every person, it has action and Humor, both at equal Quantities. As for iron man, Robert downey jr IS Iron man, no other person can do that role so perfectly. Unfortunately, RDJ is about to leave the franchise after IRON MAN 3, i request the iron man fans to please him not to leave the franchise for at least another 3 or 4 films, including AVENGERS 2. :) I will ensure to each and every person who is reading this that, this film will never disappoint you, not even a moment. 100%. :) Go watch it without doubt. I will say that, this movie will definitely touch or cross the 1Billion mark and becomes on of the highest grossing films in the film history. Verdict: 10/10 stars, A+++++, EXCELLENT.  "

This movie took me back to the history, and made it a real history, in my opinion at least.

Well what can I say about Psycho that hasn't been said a thousand times before, well nothing only that I agree with all the hype and excellent reviews that I've read and has definitely stood the test of time through the years. In my opinion Psycho is definitely the one that ranks the top of the genre list, and if it wasn't for ""Psycho"" we've probably wouldn't have had all the great slasher flicks through the years such as the successful ""Friday The 13th series"", Halloween series, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Black Christmas. All of which pays dues to this masterpiece, I mean if Psycho weren't made we may wouldn't have had all them slasher movies. I mean Psycho in my opinion inspired all these movies in some way but directer Brian De Palma is the one who uses Psycho/Hitchcock idea for many of his movies. Shot in black and white which does put some small minded people off and in my opinion it shouldn't, I think it wouldn't have had the same creepy atmoshere if it was shot in colour just look at the terrible remake which came out in 1998, but the less said about that the better i'd say. Brilliantly written and structured screenplay wouldn't have been half as effective with the proper casting, but Psycho definitely delivered in that department with performances from Janet Leigh who plays the unlucky Marion Crane who gives an vulnerable and sympathetic performance that had me siding with her despite her dishonest actions, Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates) was mesmerising in his touching, unsettling, insecure and layered role which nobody else in this world would ever compare to, I'd say he gives an Oscar worthy performance. Vera Miles (Lila Crane) Marion's sister gives a good performance as does Arbogast the unlucky private detective played by Martin Balsam gave an interesting performance. John Gavin (Sam Loomis) was OK, underplayed but didn't really do much. All in all Every element came together here to make this a visually arresting picture, directer Alfred Hitchcock was truly one of the greatest of all time and was definitely spot on with Psycho which is definitely his finest film ever.

44328,tt0816692,acidrosesrijit,india,10,Space. Time. Travel. Spacetimetravel.,"Time, as a concept, has always been relative and it has been measured by us in the changing of seasons, the passage of the sun and the moon in the sky, manifested more profoundly in the inevitable circle of life and death. I had come across ""time"" as a relative concept much later, when I read the works of Henri Bergson, prior to which I existed only from Mondays to Fridays, broken only by the time capsules of the weekends, when my imagination used to take flight. And I always used to wonder, and I still do, if I could extend that time. Time, as I said, is always relative. Mankind, in its attempt to make meaning of its existence on this plane of reality, has broken down the seasons into months, days and further on into infinitesimal quantities to arrive at some meaning of its presence here. And we have looked towards the stars and wondered about gods and the immanent will of the universe while we feebly grasp those abstractions in our own Dreamtimes, believing (relatively) that we are giving some semblance of meaning to the things around us. Interstellar is a film that presents very complex concepts that is both heart-breaking and frightening, yet riveting. The fact that time is relative and space/time take on whole new meanings out in the infiniteness of space, again emphasizes how small we are within a grand multi-dimensional omniverse. Yet, this film presents us with hope and love, and tells us, that in some n- dimensional space/time, human abstractions and emotions are the anchors that can be measured and therefore should be valued as much as our lives themselves. It is a place where twilight abstractions cease to be such and weave themselves into dimensions of reality that are as palpable as the crashing of waves or the cry of a new born child. This film, like a philosophical palimpsest, is also in many ways, comparable to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, the recent Gravity, the highly underrated Event Horizon, Andrei Tarkovsky's incomparable rendition of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, the anime Serial Experiments Lain, and last, but not the least, the visionary novel, The Time Machine, by H.G.Wells. If you want to get rattled in the head by the meaning of ""time"" - this is the movie for you.  "
80475,tt0056172,aciolino,united states,10,Coming to terms with this film seems a problem for many...,"Reading the comments posted here and the opinions in the forum it is plain to see that there are widely diverging opinions of this film which I find interesting considering the films reputation. Let me try to explain why I think this is so, and why so many find this film dull while others think it a masterpiece. First, like other Lean films, the drama is almost non-existent. The reason is that drama (the bedrock of all western art) depends on characterization and the playing out of these in various situations. But the lead character in this film, Lawrence, is an enigma, and remains so throughout the film. In a sense, he is very flat. However, in that he is an enigmatic figure we must change our view of him. That is, we must see him as being without definitive attributes one way or another. He twists in the wind, his true nature forever hidden. It is not good for dramatic purposes but for Lawrence it MUST be so, otherwise there would be no reason to make this film in the first place. We can never KNOW Lawrence -- we can only observe him from a distance, and stand, as apparently so many others have, in awe and wonder. Then we have the cast. My goodness. What an extraordinary collection of talent. The film is chock full of fabulous moments where the greatest actors speak wonderful lines. For example, some of my favorites: Guiness: ""And I...I long for the vanished gardens of Cordoba..."" The line was set up beautifully and filmed such as to make it climactic moment. Very beautiful. Similarly, ""You must be a general; I must be a King."" Consider, as well, the overall sterling performances of Shariff, Rains, and Hawkins, three enormous talents. If you are moved by these kinds of moments then the film becomes something very special. If not, then it's a bore. One more point: some may be bored by the visual. Not me. I think Lean's photography and choices are astounding, and they are essential in creating the flavor of the exotic, of distance and remoteness...mirroring the title character. Brilliant. Well, that's enough for now. PS - 5/10/09 - I neglected to mention Anthony Quinn, who has a difficult role as Auda, but whose masculine command and bravado, without cartoonishness is more than adequate. In fact, it's brilliant.

""greatest comedy,"" as these proclamations of ""fact"" are merely matters of opinion, and will change from time to time. But so impressed and in awe do I remain with 2001: A Space Odyssey, that the words are difficult to suppress. I struggle against saying, ""Yes, this is the greatest film ever made."" I struggle. In vain. What Stanley Kubrick has achieved here is, in my opinion, the summit of the creative act-- the perfect synthesis of image, plot,(or story)music, dialogue, etc, etc, in short, of all the things that comprise film and film making. Where to begin? I must say I am truly disappointed with the number of reviews that rate the film high and yet have no idea what the film is about. Kubrick, shouts to us from the very beginning (the opening fanfare) what the film is about: the evolution of man and his predicament in the Universe (Uh.. kind of a Universal theme) retold through allusions to Nietszche's ""Thus Spake Zarathustra,"" the philosophical treatise that the music was written to portray, by that greatest of all composers of ""Tone Poems,"" Richard Strauss. Man, forced to confront the mystery of his own existence, will never solve it, even throughout time, even though he may conquer time and space, technology, and his own shortcomings. No, the ""riddle theme"" is present at his evolutionary jump to the Super-man, just as it was when he first stood upright. (Beware of those who, on this review forum, have written, ""bored,"" or, ""boring."" I am forced to make the comparison to those who wrote the same things about Beethoven's 5th after it's premier, or those who chased Igor Stravinksy out of the theater after the premier of the ""Rite of Spring"" -- ""You just don't get it."" But it's not your fault. Beethoven, Stravinsky, and Kubrick have created works that are quantum leaps in the aesthetics of their respective art, so it stands to reason that many will say, ""It's boring,"" or, ""It's just noise,"" and the like. Not that I have any great gift of insight. It took a good deal of work and contemplation to achieve the epiphany of truth that these works present.) Of course, everything that happens in the film, surrounds these points. The acting, the dialogue and the choices of the characters. I'll not delineate them here, but leave it to you to discover these on your own. And do yourself a favor: if the film is ever playing anywhere on the big screen, run, fly, hire a plane, bush-wack a stagecoach, or transport yourself astrally, but GET THERE.

I am such a fan of this film that I could not let these comments go unchecked, as it were...critique-wise. I hope you all find this engaging and informing. ""The main characters are absurd and their motivations make little sense."" You'll have to be more specific and give examples of this if you want anyone to understand or respect this statement. ""The supporting cast plays characters right out of a comic-book."" I'd like to know what comic books you are reading! First of all, have you ever heard of the concept of the ""stock character?"" It's only as old as theater itself. That's what these characters are and as such are not well-drawn out but predictable and flat. They serve to inform on the main characters and plot, and are to be well recognized and familiar to the audience immediately upon entrance, a la, ""commedia dell'Arte,"" Moliere, Goldoni, Shakespeare, Plautus, etc, etc, whose stock characters, I assume, you have similar misgivings, ""All this superficiality and absurdity wouldn't matter at all if only this were a proper comedy."" Now this is a truly mystifying statement. In a ""proper"" comedy these ""absurdities"" would be, I would think, impossible, unless I misunderstand, in which case you need to provide examples from other films, plays, etc... The film plays up the near-perfection and integrity of its two main leads, but it simply doesn't wash in MacLaine's case. If she is such an angel why is she a home-wrecker who goes out with a married man with kids? ""Near perfection."" ??? Now I feel as though we are viewing two different films. All the characters, ALL OF THEM, are severely flawed. Hence, they have depth, causing us to have sympathy with them. (Which might go a long way in explaining the popularity and high regard the film has experienced, which has escaped you for some reason.) ""An angel""??? Of course she's no angel.

This is simply childish. How old are you? I would guess that you did not live at the time this film was released and may be a product of the post-1960 revolution. I mean, what does this have to do with anything? You think it mattered to her who she fell for? Have you ever been in love? Would it have been more genuine if she had fallen for the janitor??? Jeez. ""And what's with Lemmon's character? This guy is so self-sacrificing and noble that Wilder should have had him nailed to the cross in the last scene. Example's, please, of his ""self-sacrifice""? None that I can think of. If you're thinking of his protecting Sheldrake as ""self-sacrificing,"" well think again, my friend. As above, you do not see the flaw in Lemmon's character, very well and clearly delineated by his desire to climb up the ladder by pimping his apartment. And what of his picking up a married woman at the bar on Christmas eve. Nice? Again, were we watching different films? The basic plot outline of the film is good and there was real potential there for a terrific situation comedy, but Wilder took the easy route and turned this into a schmaltzy romance film with the Hollywood violins accompanying every schmaltzy scene. Quite the contrary: the easy was would have been to create a straight comedy. Among the many reasons this film is held is such high regard (again this escapes you for some reason) is that it straddles high tragedy and low comedy, a virtually impossible feat and I defy to name another film that does so with any degree of success. FINAL NOTES: I can recall seeing this film during it's initial run (yes, I'm that old). (I hate all this discussion of great films that have never been seen by the critic on the big screen--the experience is amazing and the manner in which the film improves is immeasurable). You cannot imagine the audience's reaction. Wilder had them in the palm of his hand. As the film went up, the audience went up, down, they went down. And, there was much laughter. Much more than can be achieved on a screen in one's living room...alone, which is, let's face it, how most of us watch films now. Most egregiously, you have not mentioned the performances. I cannot think of a film, let alone comedy, that contains this degree of superior acting achieved by as many actors! Here we see Lemmon at his comedic/tragic best, McClaine, no doubt at her finest, MacMurray, cast against type, is perfect, Kruschen, (an Oscar) his (the doctor's) wife, Ray Walston, and ""the guys,"" all perfect, along with the fabulous Joan Shawlee. This film, is, in total, a masterpiece of the film-maker's craft.  "

Of course, he had to be lucky enough to land Gable and Colbert. Well, luck is the residue of perspiration, or something like that. . . IHON is NOT the first ""screwball"" comedy. It is not a light, fluffy piece of ""Capra-corn."" Nor is it a fairy tale. This unique and remarkable film stands alone like a Colossus astride converging worlds of film-making, unable to be categorized, refusing to fit into a formula. It is filled with reality: the scourge of the depression is never far away, the charm of ordinary people, in ordinary situations, making them far from ordinary. The ugliness of people, so easily drawn to crime of one kind or another, and the human spirit, resilient, flawed, stubborn, immature at times, and confused, lifting itself about all. **Spoiler** An excellent example of this (there are a multitude) is the singing of ""The Man on The Flying Trapeze"". A spontaneous celebration of humans sharing a common experience and musical language (long lost, tragically, today) which elevates them (if just for a moment) above the difficulties of their lives. How beautiful. Then, we are shocked back to a different reality with the passing out of the child's mother. This is quite disturbing and not the usual fodder of the so-called ""screwball"" comedy. No, it approaches the works of Chayefsky or Wilder, or rather, they approach this films juxtaposition of the tragic and the comic. As far as the performances, look--Gable is perfect. It is impossible to take one's eyes off him for a moment and I say this as a confirm heterosexual. Gable is MAN, child, Sage, and fool, wrapped up in Peter Warne, a complete and fully realized human character. Bringing him to life, Gable is brilliant. It may be the greatest (forgive me, Jack Lemmon) single comedic acting performance ever made. Gable. No wonder they called him, ""The King."" Colbert is as well, as perfect, not a missed moment or note. She glides through the role as an ice skater warming up before an event, free and unencumbered, angry, vulnerable, phony, pure and wise. All can be seen in her visage and tone. What a performance. Roscoe Karns. Need I say more? I hope not. Perfect. Please note the absence of a soundtrack. None is necessary as the film provides its own, in its counterpoint of people of a multitude of melodic styles, faces, colors, attitudes (OH, yeah?!?!?), in its flight from fear to laughter, in its harmony of all these playing simultaneously. Who needs a soundtrack. Beautiful. Perfect.  "

What does is America itself--America in it's purest form, simple, powerful, at times, cruel and indifferent, but always....us. It is the mirror of our own lives, beliefs, and dreams we once held, perhaps still do, that is held up to us, and we are allowed to see ourselves, not as we are, but as we wished to be. America of hope, families, church, and tradition, where all peoples are held as brothers without the burden of a forced and artificial ""ethic of multiculturalism""; America of ""give the underdog a break,"" (while not being accused of being a socialist); America of good men wet with the sweat of good work, enjoying the freedom given by so many who paid so unflinchingly the ultimate price; indeed, this film presents us with an America that is the very incarnation and essence of the meaning of ""hope,"" the greatest promise of our forefathers, to which they pledged their lives and sacred honor. And each character is faced with the acceptance of that hope. And it is beautiful. If there is ever an award or citation of the ""Most American Film"" it must be this masterpiece.

16209,tt0060196,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,9,One of the greatest westerns of all time!,"Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly elevates the ""western"" to a level of art that I don't think John Ford could have even predicted. Not to take anything away from John Ford, but Leone brought a style to audiences in his ""spaghetti westerns"" that no one else could have thought possible. He stays true to the rugged, gritty feel of American westerns, but his obvious inspiration from Kurosawa's samurai films, and Leone's own personal style come together in a fascinating way that I feel is too individualistic for anyone else to have created. The characters in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly seem so alive, so rich and developed. It all seems so real that watching this can make you feel like you have stumbled upon another world, and certainly, another way of life, that has been going on forever, and will continue on long after you have left. Clint Eastwood's iconic performance as Blondie is brilliant. His unflinching confidence in every move he makes tells you right away that this is not a man to be trifled with. He never cracks under pressure, and he seems to have such a tight grasp of every situation that one would be a fool NOT to side with him. Blondie is every bit as cool, calm, and collected as Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, and also every bit as rewarding to watch! Lee Van Cleef is menacing as Angel Eyes, a bounty hunter who gives the impression that he never met a man who could come close to making him feel threatened. Then, there is Tuco, played by Eli Wallach. Tuco, as dastardly as he is, serves as the comic relief, which is important in a film like this that is filled with tension (the montage in the cemetery is classic!). This movie has action, suspense, drama, and humor, all of which are flavored with Ennio Morricone's famous score and the brilliant cinematography of Tonino Delli Colli. I have not seen enough of Leone's films to say that this is his best, but I can say that this is an excellent film, worthy of all of the praise it has received since its release!  "
45442,tt0034583,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,10,One of the greatest motion pictures of all time!,"When Michael Curtiz' film, Casablanca, left Warner Bros. studio and hit the silver screen in 1942, it was intended to be a well-received box-office success. It had a star-studded cast, a fine director, and very talented writers. What more does a film need to be successful? Needless to say, Casablanca more than surpassed all expectations. It won three Academy Awards (Best Director, Picture, and Screenplay) in 1943. That, in of itself, is impressive for a movie that was produced in much the same way as about fifty-one other pictures that were produced by Warner Bros. that year. Granted, this movie did have a lot going for it, but there was some confusion during the making of it, like, trying to decide on an ending, for example. The ending was a last-minute thought by the writers, and so Ingrid Bergman was likely just as surprised to hear it as her on-screen persona, Ilsa. The ending, like the entire film, has, of course gone down in movie history as being one of the more memorable endings of all time. In retrospect, all of the honors and success that Casablanca received was nothing in comparison to the impact that it has had ever since it came out. As for the movie itself, what can be said about Casablanca that hasn't already been said? It is an extraordinary film. It is entertaining and powerful. It won't dazzle you with ""avant-garde cinematic expression"" or Freudian references. It is simply a well-crafted movie. Plain and simple. Michael Curtiz oversaw the making of one of the highlights of American cinema. The writing was exceptional, with humor sprinkled in between drama, romance, action, suspense, etc. The performances in Casablanca, though, are a joy to behold. Humphrey Bogart's bitter, vulnerable Rick is easily one of his greatest achievements, while Ingrid Bergman was more beautiful than ever as Ilsa, Rick's love interest. Paul Henreid supplies Ilsa's husband, Victor, with a dignity that makes him as honorable as any screen hero I've ever seen. Claude Rains gives a typically wonderful performance as the corrupt Captain Renault, who respects Rick, but must answer to Major Strasser (played by Conrad Veidt at his most sinister), a Nazi sent to Casablanca to find Victor. Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre contribute small, but equally important and memorable characters, as Ferrari and Ugarte, respectively. Last, but certainly not least, is Dooley Wilson, who brought a warm sincerity to this movie that was just as powerful as any other emotion on display during the film. It just doesn't get much better than this. I have recommended this film to everyone I have met who has missed out on this wonderful film. It has it all, and if you have not seen Casablanca, do yourself a favor, and see it now!  "

After having seen City Lights, I am that much more interested in seeing even more of his work. Let me reiterate, Chaplin was a genius! His timing was flawless. His ability to evoke emotion was extraordinary, and he knew how to tell a story! Actor, writer, director, producer, composer; it was not unlike Chaplin to do it all in his movies, but to do all of these, and to do them so brilliantly - it can only be described as genius. This film, is a wonderful place to start for anyone interested in the work of Charles Chaplin. While I feel that The Gold Rush is the better film, I would still recommend this just as quickly. It contains the wonderful sight gags, pratfalls, and classic comedy for which Chaplin's films are so renowned. From the opening scene, the unveiling of the monument, you know that you are in for a treat. The film is not all comedy, though. There is romance and drama as well. Yet, this is where this film shines so brightly; it IS comedy, it IS romance, and it IS drama. All three genres are presented here, purely, and yet, they are intertwined so exquisitely that the viewer hardly realizes the shifts in emotion! This film exemplifies the lost art of ""classic"" comedy, standing today as a monument to what contemporary comedies should aspire to. And just as it was with the monument in the film, it is The Tramp, Charlie Chaplin who makes it all worth-while!  "

A story of man vs. machine, individual vs. ""the system,"" and hope in the face of a world that seems to have grown apart from humanity, Modern Times is an inspiration! It is not inspirational because of the laundry list of problems facing our heroes, but because of their unrelenting resilience, their ability to ""Smile"" at the end of it all. Chaplin social commentary is presented in a satirical, yet optimistic, way, so that we are free to recognize the size of the problems at hand, but never allowed to sink into the hopelessness that such troubles often bring. We are led by Chaplin through a tumultuous time in American history; one of labor disputes, high unemployment, poverty, and despair. Fortunately we are guided by The Tramp, in his final screen appearance, all the way to the light at the end of the long, dark tunnel, his humor and pathos as poignant as ever. Through his phenomenal brand of physical comedy and ingenious directing, we see that all we need to do is smile, and not give in to the world that surrounds us, and we will see a brighter day. An extraordinary film of great power, with a message that should be seen by anyone who has ever struggled through a hard time in their life! A masterpiece!  "

Stanley Kubrick looks directly into the eye of the Cold War; the paranoia, the fear, the tension, the politics of major world powers gone mad, with the fate of the entire world hanging in the balance, and he snickers! Kubrick accomplished the impossible in 1963...He made the world laugh at the nuclear bomb. He didn't do it by sugar-coating anything, in fact, he did the exact opposite, painting a pointedly dark and satirical portrait of the powers that be. This portrait, too accurate not to fear, yet too accurate not to laugh at hysterically, resembles a group of little boys comparing the quality of their toys. The insanity of The Cold War is exposed, almost to the point of violation. There are clowns deciding the fate of the world, and human lives are nothing more than statistics, yet through Kubrick's lens, we find humor in the tragedy! We see how ridiculous it all is. An army general manipulates a complex Cold War strategy in order to start a nuclear war with the Russians because he blames fluoridation for his impotence. It sounds preposterous, and it is, but anyone who follows politics knows that the crazier things appear, the more realistic they usually are. The manic performances of Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and even Sterling Haden's twisted Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper provide the life to this story, which speaks so often of an ultimate doom. Peter Sellers plays three parts - Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and the mad genius, Dr. Strangelove. The President is Sellers playing it straight, while Mandrake shows a little more of Sellers' eccentricity, but it is in Strangelove that he goes completely over the top. Speaking of over the top, George C. Scott gives an incredible energy to his roll as General ""Buck"" Turgidson. Scott later admitted that this was his own personal favorite performance. Slim Pickens basically plays himself as the gung-ho Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, who caps off the film in one of the most famous scenes in modern movie history. The satire is powerful, the humor dark, and the end result - remarkable. The detail that went into the War Room and the interior of the aircraft is amazing. The fact that Kubrick could produce a comedy as hysterical as Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is testimony to his far-reaching genius, and another example of the classics that have come together to form his legacy! A must-see!  "
61019,tt0032553,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,8,Chaplin's most powerful political statement!,"Charles Chaplin's The Great Dictator is a political statement wrapped in a comedy with a little bit of drama here and there. It is not his best work, but I would definitely recommend it to Chaplin fans. I feel that Charlie Chaplin was at his most powerful in his silent films. Here, he seems a little unsure of himself, in terms of balancing acts that he could pantomime with verbal jokes. Don't get me wrong, there is some hilarious dialog in this movie. It is not short on laughs by any means, but Chaplin's best films had a brilliant sense of balance to them, a balance between drama and comedy that few have ever been able to match. It is a very good movie, but, unfortunately I don't feel it matches up against Chaplin's best, although, I can't think of many films that do! What this film does have going for it, and it has quite a bit going for it, is another brilliant performance from Charles Chaplin. Only this time, aside from his spectacular physical comedy, Chaplin proves he also knows how to deliver his lines with a comedic timing that is every-bit as precise as his pantomime. The highlights are the brilliant dance with the globe and the powerful, moving speech that Chaplin gives at the end of the film. His performance as Adenoid Hynkel, a biting satire of Adolf Hitler, is so off-the-wall, so silly that it accomplishes exactly what Chaplin sought out to do - to make the world laugh at Hitler, to rob him of his power. Mel Brooks would do a fine job of defaming Hitler twenty-eight years later in his hilarious debut film, The Producers. If there is one lesson to be learned from this movie (that isn't expressed in the speech at the end), it's that laughter can sometimes be the best medicine. While no one can ever undo the atrocities that Hitler exposed the world to, we can survive, as long as we have our ideals and our sense of humor.  "
74649,tt0022100,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,9,"Fritz Lang's study of serial murder, justice, and the death penalty","Based on an article Fritz Lang read about serial killer Peter Kuerten, M is a fascinating study of the criminal mind. Peter Lorre is compelling as Hans Beckert, a murderer of little girls. His diminutive size and high pitched squeal are used to great effect to hide the enormity of the demons within him. Mr. Beckert preys on little girls, buying them balloons, candy, anything they might want, just as long as they agree to leave with him. The murders are never shown, though, because Lang knew that by leaving them to our imagination, we provide far worse depictions of what may have transpired than anything that could have been put to film. Besides, no censors would have allowed such things to be shot at that time anyway. Instead, we see a balloon with no owner, a ball with no one to bounce it, and a dinner plate awaiting the return of Beckert's latest victim. Of course, the entire town is panic-stricken, and the film shifts its magnifying lens to the effects that Beckert's killing spree has on the remaining populace. We see fear, anger, frustration. The police are at their wits' end, attempting to catch a criminal who strikes on impulse and leaves hardly any clues at the murder scenes. To make matters worse, the frenzied public cannot agree on any solid leads. Even the underworld is haunted by the murders. The police are everywhere, searching for any clue at all, and the criminals have no way of getting around to their ill-gotten gains. Finally, the criminals decide it is up to them to succeed where the police have failed, and so, they decide to catch the monster themselves. In the meantime, psychological evidence taken from Beckert's hand-writing leads the police to the conclusion that Hans is clinically insane, killing out of a pathological need. The man hunt continues until a mob of criminals finally track down the perpetrator. Hans is then taken to an abandoned ware-house where he is subjected to a kangaroo court. In a panic, Hans admits that he has no control over his murdering little children, he pleads insanity. He begs to be placed under police custody, which is a joke to the ""court,"" compromised of every criminal that had to put his work on hold because of Beckert's string of homicides. Peter Lorre is spectacular in conveying Hans' desperation and the agony with which he lives every day of his life. His words fall on deaf ears, except for the man who has been appointed to ""defend"" him. His defense argues that he cannot be held responsible his actions if he cannot control himself. A wonderful debate takes place here, arguing over the justice or injustice of the death penalty, and whether or not it fair to punish a man who is clinically insane. Just before his sentence is to be carried out, though, the police arrive, and Beckert is taken into custody. You never find out what happens to him, though, as the film ends with the mother of one of the victims telling us that the no court ruling can ever bring her child back. Some may find this film slow or disappointing because of a lack of ""action"" or a some-what anti-climactic ending, but I believe that this film does what it set out to do. It sheds some light on the criminal mind, shows the psychological effects that a serial killer has on us all, questions our sense of justice, and also questions the morality of the death penalty. This film is disturbing, and I will admit that I find it a little slow here and there, but there is so much here to think about, that I cannot help but give it 9 out of 10 stars. Highly recommended!

85305,tt0040522,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,10,Powerful.,"Some films try to explain multiple aspects of a story or a character by showing several episodes from the character's life. Vittorio De Sica's masterful The Bicycle Thief relies on the power of simplicity to drive home its point. It is a very simple film, relying on film making at its basics. There are no professional actors for us to identify with, but there are plot lines, emotions, and thoughts that no one can help but relate to. Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) has been waiting for a job, but when one finally arrives, he must obtain a bicycle in order to be able to accept the position. His loving and caring wife, Maria (Lianella Carell), hocks the bed sheets in order to be able to afford a bicycle for Antonio. He reports to work as a poster hanger, but while on the job for only a short time, the bike is stolen by a young thief (Vittorio Antonucci). Desperate to get the vehicle back, Antonio seeks the aid of his friend, Baiocco (Gino Saltamerenda), and also receives the help of his devoted son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola). Bruno stays by Antonio's side, no matter what, determined to help his father get back the stolen property. It is a frustrating journey for the father and son, as they receive no help, except that of Baiocco. It seems that no matter what they do, Antonio is left with a fateful decision (shown in one of the most brutally honest scenes in any movie I've ever seen). He must ask himself just how far would he go to put food on the table for his family that he loves so much? There has been controversy over the ending of the film, which I am not going to go into, because it would be cheating you out of a brilliant ending to an extraordinary picture. However, I will say this much - When viewing The Bicycle Thief, ask yourself what you would do in Antonio's situation. What choices would you make? Some of the questions that rise from this film are some of the questions that help us to define ourselves as people, and the fact that this film provides such a clear and honest representation of so many facts of life is what makes it an undeniable masterpiece! This is a film to be cherished!  "
89320,tt0042876,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,10,A masterpiece of Japanese cinema! A must-see!,"Akira Kurosawa's classic Rashomon is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. It is often cited as the reason that the Academy Awards started a foreign film category. Incidentally, it did win an Honorary Award from the Academy for Best Foreign Film. More than a film, Rashomon is more of a meditation on this dishonest nature of man. As we listen to four different testimonies of the same heinous crime, we see that people will lie to save themselves, no matter what the circumstances. The film begins with a priest and a wood cutter speaking within a temple during a terrible rain. Their conversation is a mystery until another man arrives, and begins to ask questions about their subject matter. It is revealed that the men have just returned from court, where they gave their testimonies in a trial against a vicious bandit known as Tajomaru (Toshiro Mifune in all of his manic, savage mastery). The bandit tells his side of the story. The woman that he most-likely raped follows with her version of the truth. Then, the story takes an odd twist toward the macabre as a medium is called in to channel the spirit of the woman's murdered husband, who provides an all-together different story. Needless to say, the case is hopeless. The priest and wood cutter find themselves drowning in their own self-pity because of the horrendous state of the world. The priest lamenting that he has lost his faith in man. The other man at the temple laughs it all off, having seen too much tragedy in his lifetime to weep over the injustice which has just taken place. The film does end on a relatively upbeat tone, however. The wood cutter is given a chance to take control of life, a reminder that his life is his own, and that his decisions are still his own, even in the face of the insurmountable odds against anyone struggling to survive in his troubled times. To me, the three men at the temple are the forces of good, evil, and humanity, which is trapped in the middle. The priest is a holy man seeking virtue in a time when virtue was essentially a sign of weakness. The man who approached the wood cutter and the priest embodies the corrupted soul of man, embittered by the harsh cruelties of reality. The wood cutter, neither virtuous nor evil, is confused, and has resigned to be neutral, no matter how much it may hurt him. However, out of the midst of all of this chaos, rain, murder, rape, and perjury, hope is found, and I believe that the wood cutter takes his first step toward realizing his dream by attempting to become that which he prays for - a man of decency. This film is extraordinarily powerful. The contrast of the endless downpour at the temple and the beautiful, sun-soaked forest is magnificent, as is the cinematography on the whole. The writing and directing is wonderful, and the performances of the actors and actresses, while arguably over-the-top (note that this was the acting style being used at the time), are more powerful than anything else. Toshiro Mifune's performance was particularly striking as the remorseless bandit. Emotionally poignant performances from Machiko Kyo, Masayuki Mori, and Takashi Shimura, among others create a stirring ensemble which Kurosawa masterfully uses to weave this ancient tale (the film was based on a story called ""In the Grove"") into a cinematic masterpiece that brought him international recognition. I would recommend this film to anyone due to the fact that I believe it to be a work of infinite cinematic value and of great philosophical significance. This is an absolute must-see!  "

Despite the fact that parts of the film are no longer available, the efforts to reconstruct the original film from its remains are valiant enough to provide enough to make the story clear. The special effects were far ahead of their time and the set designs were, in some cases, phenomenal. I can see where some people may not enjoy this movie. It is hard for some to really appreciate a movie that is 77 years old, because a lot has happened in film since then. Yet, if you look at the basic elements of this movie - its story, characters, artwork, cinematography, etc., I believe this movie has just as much to offer now as it must have in the late 1920's. Also, take into consideration the asthetics of German expressionist film when viewing this. The performances and set designs are going to be over the top. That was part of the style.

It is a masterful blend of comedy, drama, and romance, among other genres seamlessly brought together in one extraordinary picture. Like all great movies, The Gold Rush has more than its share of memorable moments, from the Thanksgiving dinner to the dance of the dinner rolls to the cabin teetering on the edge of the mountain. All of these scenes are brilliant because of The Tramp's flawless physical comedy. He was a master of comedic timing, and he was one of the most graceful physical comedians I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong, this picture is not just three fantastic scenes amongst filler. The film moves along at a brisk pace, following the misadventures of our hero, The Lone Prospector (Charlie Chaplin, of course), as he attempts to hit it big by discovering gold in Alaska. Along his journey through the elements, the prospector meets the notorious Black Larsen (Tom Murray), a wanted criminal willing to do anything to get his hands on some gold. Fortunately, our friend also comes across a fellow prospector, Big Jim McKay (Mack Swain), who has finally defied all odds and struck it rich. But the Lone Prospector's adventures take place not only out in the middle of nowhere. When he is forced back to civilization, he falls in love with Georgia (Georgia Hale), the most beautiful girl in town. Of course, it would be all too easy if no one else was interested in this beauty. Jack Cameron (Malcolm Waite), the handsome lady's man who is not content with every other woman in town by his side; he must have Georgia, as well. Competition arises between the disappointed prospector and the ego-maniacal ""lady killer."" All of this would be too much for any one of us, but the Lone Prospector handles it all with his uncompromising resilience in the face of insurmountable odds to bring us one of the greatest comedies of all time!

One man who wishes for nothing more than an improvement upon a country that he already cherishes. He intends to do everything he can to fulfill his duty as a newly appointed Senator. However, the people that put him there were not nearly as patriotic in their intentions. Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold) and Senator Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains) have conspired to put Smith in office in hopes that he will simply sit there and keep quiet while they pass a bill that will profit Taylor. Smith's dream of building a national boy's camp is shattered by Taylor's scheme to build a dam in the same area. The powerful Jim Taylor is forced to pull some strings in order to discredit the young senator so that his dam can be built. The Taylor Machine frames Smith, accusing him of fraud. Shamed, Smith is ready to leave Washington behind when his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur) inspires him to fight for his ideals just as his forefathers had. Smith returns to congress, armed with a new strategy to accomplish his goal. James Stewart gives one of his finest performances as Jefferson Smith, the young, passionately patriotic Senator confronting corruption in the government he holds so dear. Jean Arthur's performance as Clarissa Saunders is strong, while Claude Rains is forced to counter Stewart's inspired intensity (a feat that I feel he accomplishes). The filibuster scene is one of the highlights of the film, and one of the more memorable sequences in American cinema. Mr. Smith Goes to Washington is a wonderful movie, not just because of James Stewart's relentless performance, but because it has quite a bit to say. It is a statement declaring that ideals are stronger than the pages they are printed on, and that it is our ideals and the spirit through which we see them realized that allows one man to topple ""the machine.""

Death - ""I am Death."" Antonius Block - ""Have you come for me?"" Death - ""I have long walked by your side."" Antonius Block - ""So I have noticed."" The Seventh Seal, considered by some to be Ingmar Bergman's greatest achievement, is the desperate prayer of a sensitive, introspective, and insightful young man confused by the horrors of the world around him. Ingmar Bergman's films are often very deep, full of symbolism, philosophy, spirituality, emotion, and thought. The Seventh Seal is classic Bergman. Expressing his fear of life with no meaning, death with no understanding, and faith with no validity, Ingmar Bergman takes us deep into the well of his mind. As the Black Plague ravages the world, a Antonius Block and his squire, Jons (Max Von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand, respectively), return from fighting in the Crusades. They find their homeland devastated by the plague, their countrymen mad with fear, and their cause lost. Antonius Block is confronted by Death (Bengt Ekerot). Block challenges Death to a game of chess to provide him time to seek answers to the questions that plague his mind as Death has plagued his country. Death accepts, knowing that Block cannot escape his fate, and the two begin their game. As the story continues, Block and Jons meet with several testaments to the agony that the Black Death has brought upon their land. They find a young girl who is to be burned at the stake for having been with the Devil. They find madness in the eyes of all they meet, as everyone is convinced that God is angry and is punishing the world with the plague. They also find a small group of travelling actors, who appear to be the only souls to have remained sane in the midst of all of the death and fear. Block and Jons move across the countryside in the hopes of finding safety in Block's castle, but Death is always around the corner, biding his time. Brilliantly conceived, and stunningly executed, Bergman's vision is brought to the screen through Gunnar Fischer's powerful cinematography creating images that will likely remain with you for the rest of your life. Strong performances from everyone involved bring humanity to the film. Max Von Sydow's brave and conflicted Antonius Block matching wits with Bengt Ekerot's sinister, omnipotent Death is a microcosm of the forces at work in this breath-taking interpretation of the mortal struggle. A masterpiece!  "
113397,tt0031381,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,8,The film that set the standard for grandeur...,"David O. Selznick set out to make the biggest, and best, film that money could buy. The result is one of the biggest, most-successful, most critically acclaimed American films of all time - Gone With the Wind. Based on Margaret Mitchell's tale of long-lost southern gallantry, and a way of life that would never return, Gone With the Wind is a work of fiction, set in a glorified Technicolor rendition of the old south. Now, to say that this is all historically accurate would be like saying that this is a short film. Clocking in at just under four hours long, this story can be a little hard to sit through. You really have to get caught up in the soap opera. Once you do, however, it is not hard to see why this film is as highly regarded as it is. I can't help but feel that it is a little over-rated, but considering when it was made, it is spectacular. Vivien Leigh is extraordinary as the beautiful and manipulative Scarlett O'Hara. The intensity of each emotion she expresses throughout the film is outstanding! Clark Gable is the foil to Ms. Leigh's southern belle, the dashing, devil-may-care Rhett Butler. He is often very cool, allowing room for his bottled-up emotion to erupt. He spars with Scarlett, her intensity versus his calm resolve, but both characters are quite similar in many other ways...Leslie Howard is Ashley Wilkes, the physical embodiment of a southern gentleman. His wife, Melanie Hamilton, is played with a quiet grace all her own by Olivia de Havilland. Hattie McDaniel's Academy Award winning performance as Mammy, the voice of reason amongst all of the drama, is just as astounding as any of the other performances in this epic picture. While not a perfect film, Gone With the Wind is still an extremely important one, and should not be missed by anyone interested in classic American cinema.  "
126753,tt0025316,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,9,Pure Capra magic!,"It Happened One Night set a pretty high water mark for romantic comedies back in 1934, a standard that has rarely been met, and possibly never surpassed. Any classic movie lover would be hard-pressed to deny the charm of this film. As enjoyable as any of Capra's best, I Happened One Night is one of those rare films that is a joy to watch, simply for its entertainment value. Clark Gable stars as Peter Worne, a hard-nosed reporter, who just got the pink slip from his job when he runs into Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert), the daughter of millionaire Alexander Andrews. Having run away from her father, Ellie is trying to get to New York to be with her husband, King Westley (Jameson Thomas). Smelling a story, Worne decides it may be best for both of them to stick together for a while. What the newsman doesn't count on is that he may see more to Ellie than what he had counted on. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert play off of each other wonderfully throughout the movie, displaying a the chemistry between stars that makes a movie a classic. The achievements of the Capra and company did not go unnoticed during Oscar season, either. It Happened One Night made Oscar history as being the first film to sweep the five major categories at the Academy Awards, a feat that would not occur again until One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did it in 1975. Aside from winning Best Picture, the film also took in Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert), and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin). It Happened One Night should not be missed!  "
132474,tt0053198,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,10,The beginning of a new age in world cinema!,"The beauty of Francois Truffaut's The 400 Blows is not found in terms of its technical merit (even though, in technical terms, it is still a brilliant piece), but in the heart and soul of the film, the shear love with which it was made. Truffaut said time and time again that the cinema saved his life, and you get the impression that the only way he felt he could repay his sanctuary was by committing himself to it. He did so in many ways! Not only did the auteur commit his time to movies, by being a lover of film and a critic, he soon became a director, producing this inspired masterpiece. Perhaps, that is what makes it a masterpiece. The film truly is inspired; inspired by Truffaut's life, his passion for cinema, and his theories about how films should be created. The result is amazing! Antoine Doinel, played by Jean-Pierre Leaud, is a misunderstood young boy, trying to keep his head above water, despite being caught up in what seems to be a predestined downward spiral. His teacher and his parents do not trust him, and he knows this. Seeing no trust to betray, he does whatever he can to try to compensate for how miserable he is treated. His mother (Claire Maurier) is busy working and trying to be a housewife, despite an affair she is having with another man. His father (Albert Remy) seems nice enough, but loses his temper when he is disappointed in the young man. Because of an already-existent lack of trust the parents have for their son, everything he does is perceived as wrong. No one ever takes the time (not his parents, certainly not his despicable teacher) to actually look at the boy, to determine whether there is any malice in his actions, or if he is simply a misguided little boy, searching for something he cannot describe or define. This is Truffaut's gift - He allows us to look through the screen, to see this young man, to study him, maybe for only one hundred minutes, but we are given the time to see the truth in this child that few probably ever saw in the young, tormented Truffaut. To miss this film is to deprive yourself of a rare cinematic experience!  "
137069,tt0052311,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,9,Universal had no clue of how great Orson Welles' direction was!,"From the famous opening shot panning from a doomed car carrying a ticking bomb, Orson Welles begins building the suspense. Welles also uses this opening seen to introduce practically every character in the film so you immediately have a feel for the shady world you're about to enter. Aside from lending his directorial genius to Touch of Evil, Mr. Welles also contributes his performance as the grotesquely obese, crooked Police Captain Hank Quinlan, one of the great screen villains of all time! His prejudice is as complete as his corruption as he abuses his power as a police officer to enforce justice as he sees fit. Quinlan's method of operations comes into question when the honey-mooning Mike and Susan Vargas (Charlton Heston and Janet Leigh, respectively) find themselves at the scene of an explosion. Vargas, an up-and-coming Mexican narcotics officer (yes, Heston plays a Mexican, but the film is very good despite this question of casting) is waiting to testify in a case against a Mexican narcotics ring. Vargas, begins to uncover the truth about Quinlan's investigations, and the two battle for position in this brilliant film noir. Vargas is played with Charlton Heston's signature pride and dignity, as he attempts to bring Quinlan's reign of terror to an end. Susan Vargas is trapped in the middle of the conflict between the two detectives. Susan Vargas is portrayed by the lovely Janet Leigh, who is every bit as beautiful as ever in this film. She isn't given many lines, but she delivers what lines she does have with passion and energy. Akim Tamiroff plays Joe Grandi, this film's representation of Mexico's underworld. There are also some interesting cameos in this film, including Marlene Dietrich as ""Tana,"" Zsa Zsa Gabor as a strip club owner, Mercedes McCambridge as a member of a gang, and Welles' long-time collaborator, Joseph Cotten as the coroner. This film contains enough gritty atmosphere, suspense, plot twists, and brilliant cinematography to keep you coming back over and over again for any number of reasons. It is a stunning example of everything a film noir should be; dark and mysterious, every shot tainted with a Touch of Evil!  "
138279,tt0075686,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,9,"A classically intellectual, yet heart-felt, approach to romantic comedy.","Intellectuals tend to over-think things sometimes, well, probably more like most of the time. This obsessive compulsion to analyze often brings nothing but disappointment, frustration, and cynicism. This, is Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), famous comedian ""looking for love in all the wrong places."" Or are they the right places, but Alvy won't let them be right? Is he afraid of a real relationship? Is the commitment too much for him? Does he fear the rejection and the disappointment? Who knows? Chances are, it's all of these things, and more. Allen's Alvy Singer is neurotic, so lost in his own fears and apprehensions that he cannot live his life. When he meets the beautiful, but awkwardly giddy Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), he decides to give romance another try. Annie, though, has some issues of her own. The two find solace in their similarities, yet the couple's neurotic nature tends to take a toll on them both, as the relationship continues through its ups and downs throughout the film. Told in retrospect, the film is a series of flashbacks and hilarious personal notes, chronicling the relationship of Annie and Alvy. There are plenty of great jokes and uncomfortable moments throughout the movie, as the intimacies of an unstable, but loving, relationship between two complicated people unravel. Allen, in what is often considered his breakthrough film, provides a witty and intelligent look into the irrationality of relationships, while offering humor as medicine to fight the bitterness that can sometimes accompany them. His intellectualization of the couple's time together does not divert attention from the emotions that are felt; the love, the anxiety, the frustration, the excitement, the laughter, and the tears. Diane Keaton's Oscar-winning performance as Annie Hall is truly remarkable. She is so sincere, revealing the insecurities and timidity that comes with trying to find love and acceptance without compromising who you are. Truly, Keaton is spectacular! All in all, I have to say that Annie Hall is every bit as touching and insightful as it is hilarious! Highly recommended!  "
142950,tt0056801,ACitizenCalledKane,united states,10,Creative genius!,"Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is one of my all-time favorite movies. I honestly believe it to be one of the most creative films I have ever seen. Told through a brilliant collage of memories, fantasies, and experiences, 8 1/2 presents its protagonist, a famous director named Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), with a psychological intimacy so deep that it could never be told in a conventional way. Fellini believed in telling a story as he understood it, even if he, himself, did not understand it. This honesty is what brings the confusion of Guido to life. No one, not even Guido, is completely sure of what is going on. Guido is lost on many levels, searching for something, but he does not know what. While he probes through his mind, seeking answers, there is an unrelenting paparazzi buzzing around the famous director, asking infinite questions about his upcoming picture. Guido would most-likely provide answers to the people around him, if he knew any of the answers they seek. His world and his mind are filled with questions and devoid of answers. Mastroianni does a remarkable job of showing the stress and strain Guido is under. His face is so worn at certain points in the movie. He appears to be exhausted himself. Watching this, it's hard not to see that Guido is on the edge, clinging to the idea that the next moment will provide his long-awaited answers. His problems only gain momentum, however, until a press conference that changes his personal and artistic lives forever. Fellini does a magnificent job at balancing Guido's Freudian fantasies and tension-filled life so that the downward spiral of one man's breakdown is elevated, through surrealism, to an almost dreamlike state. The supporting cast is quite effective with a wide array of eccentricities. Nino Rota's music is playful and whimsical, catering to the insanity that is Guido's high-profile world. Gianni Di Venanzo's cinematography is equally extraordinary. Federico Fellini's 8 1/2 is as spectacular as his alter-ego, Guido, would have wished his film could have been. Out of a crippling creative block came a brilliantly conceived work of creative genius! An outstanding film!  "

This movie ""captured my imagination"" when I was a kid, and to see it now, after over twenty years was to rediscover it. Honestly, it was like seeing an old friend. However, I got even more out of seeing it now than I did as a child. Aside from the awe-inspiring land of Oz, the brilliant use of Technicolor to suggest another ""world,"" and the tender performance of Judy Garland, this film contains little bits of Wiz-dom that make it that much more enjoyable years later. Warm performances from Frank Morgan, as Professor Marvel/The Wizard of Oz (among other roles in the picture), Ray Bolger, as Hunk/The Scarecrow, Bert Lahr, as Zeke/The Cowardly Lion, and Jack Haley, as Hickory/The Tin Man, all add to the sincerity of the film.

1872,tt0111161,ackstasis,australia,10,Uplifting and Inspirational,"Back in 1994, 'The Shawshank Redemption' opened to lukewarm reviews and mild economic success, securing less than $30 million at the domestic box office. Though nominated for a very respectable seven Academy Awards, it failed to win any of these, up against the likes of 'Forrest Gump' and 'Pulp Fiction.' Since then, the film has steadily grown in popularity and now stands as one of the most highly-regarded films of the 1990's.  Convicted for the brutal murder of his wife and her lover, a crime of which he claims to be innocent, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins, 'Mystic River,' 2003) is ordered to serve two back-to-back life sentences at Shawshank Prison. Life is hard. The prison guards are brutal and unforgiving, many prisoners are ruthlessly antagonistic towards Andy, and the warden is greedy and corrupt. Nevertheless, Andy forms lifelong friendships with many of his fellow prisoners, most particularly Red (Morgan Freeman, 'Se7en,' 1995), the ""man who can get things."" Clinging stubbornly to the knowledge of his own innocence, Andy never loses his hope that justice will inevitably prevail.   Despite being a story filled with suffering and adversity, 'The Shawshank Redemption' remains one of the most uplifting and inspirational films of all time. "
3943,tt0068646,ackstasis,australia,10,I believe in America,"'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.  A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part ∂? and there are a lot of them ∂? has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.  Marlon Brando ∂? in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback ∂? gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul. "
5421,tt0071562,ackstasis,australia,9,Your country ain't your blood. Remember that,"To call 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)' a sequel doesn't quite do it justice. It is more of a companion piece to the original film, serving as both a prequel and a sequel, both expanding and enriching the characters and story presented in 'The Godfather (1972).' This week I was fortunate enough to attend a cinema screening of the second film {each instalment of the trilogy played over three consecutive weeks}, and needless to say it was well worth the late night. When we last left Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), he'd just been ""baptised"" into the world of organised crime. Now, years on, he must accept that his position of corrupt power can only lead to the disintegration of his family, and the loss of everybody he's ever cared about. Michael's plateau of despair, following the impressive rise we witnessed in 'The Godfather,' is here juxtaposed with the historical ascent of his father Vito Corleone (now played by Robert De Niro) from a humble but traumatic childhood in Corleone, Sicily. The comparison delicately suggests the downside of the so-called ""American Dream"" in which Vito believes so passionately.  As with 'The Godfather,' Coppola's film could only have succeeded with interesting and authentic acting performances, and the cast doesn't disappoint. Al Pacino has rarely been better, playing Michael Corleone with a violent intensity that suggests the lasting influence of brother Sonny (James Cann), who was assassinated in the previous film. Pacino's scene with Diane Keaton, in which we learn that she received an abortion for her unborn son, is one of the most traumatic moments of spousal interaction I've ever seen, with Pacino exhibiting a barely-suppressed rage through his severe, almost fearful, eyes, and a quiver in the jaw. An under-appreciated John Cazale brings depth and pathos to weaker brother Fredo, and Robert Duvall is excellent as Tom Hagen. New to the 'Godfather' cast are Lee Strasberg (President of the Actors Studio) and Michael V. Gazzo, as business associates who may be plotting against the Corleone family. De Niro won an Oscar for his portrayal of a younger Don Vito, understatedly evoking the essence of the character without parodying Marlon Brando.  'The Godfather: Part II' is certainly an impressive achievement, but it doesn't quite manage to equal its predecessor. Whereas the original film achieved the bulk of its emotional power through the transformation of its central character, 'Part II' leaves Michael hopelessly stranded in his despair, portraying neither his rise nor his downfall. Having effectively sold his soul for the family in the previous film, Michael must now come to terms with his desolation, alone in his misery, and having long forsaken any opportunity for salvation. He concludes the film still at the height of organised crime in America, and yet receives no reassurance from his position of power. Michael is alone, a dejected and self-loathing soul, without comfort from the family he helped destroy. It's a haunting ending that will remain with you for hours afterwards, but nevertheless doesn't seem like a conclusive ending to the entire Corleone saga. Fortunately, Coppola returned sixteen years later to direct 'The Godfather: Part III (1990),' which charts, I believe, Michael Corleone's inevitable downfall. Hopefully I won't be disappointed. "
6394,tt0468569,ackstasis,australia,8,You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain,"The night is dark. After a brief period in which organised crime retreated into a minor enterprise, Gotham City has once again fallen into shadow. The Caped Crusader has done all that he could, but, if he is to eradicate corruption once and for all, he will require the cooperation of Lieutenant James Gordon (Gary Oldman), the untouchable honest cop, and Havey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), the newly-appointed district attorney and Gotham's celebrated ""White Knight."" However, the emergence of a cackling, deranged psychotic, dubbed The Joker (Heath Ledger), threatens to throw the entire city into chaos ∂? how deeply can he corrupt the uneasy alliance between Gotham City's authorities? 'The Dark Knight (2008)' is director Christopher Nolan's eagerly-awaited sequel to his own 'Batman Begins (2005),' which successfully rebooted the Batman franchise and returned some class to the ""superhero"" genre in general. Unapologetically dark in tone, Nolan's film further explores the split-personality relationship of Bruce Wayne/Batman, comparing and contrasting him with Harvey Dent as he spirals downwards into his persona as super-villain Two-Face. In terms of character development, 'The Dark Knight' seems to have shifted itself into neutral gear. Whereas 'Batman Begins' portrayed Bruce Wayne's transformation from an angst-ridden, morally-conflicted billionaire to his noble, crime-fighting alter ego, Christopher and Jonathan Nolan, who penned the screenplay, here seem satisfied with Batman as the tough, unaffected crusader. Though there is a noticeable shift in how the audience perceives Batman's role in Gotham City ∂? he changes from a righteous champion to a shadowy vigilante, depending upon the needs of its citizens ∂? Bruce Wayne faces few of the moral dilemmas explored into the film's predecessor, and, despite the good work of Christian Bale, his character is not altogether of much interest. Aaron Eckhart undergoes a more interesting (and much more literal) transformation as the ""White Knight"" who is irretrievably corrupted by the evil psychological games of The Joker. Eckhart is convincing in the role, though his conversion to the ""dark side"" seemed to have been rushed, and that Batman's final confrontation was with Two-Face rather than the Joker is an unfortunate anti-climax. Of course, nothing but praise may be heaped upon the late Heath Ledger, whose characterisation of The Joker will be undoubtedly be remembered for decades to come. The Australian actor, long known down here for his performances in 'The Patriot (2000)' and 'Ned Kelly (2003),' passed away in tragic circumstances on January 22, 2008 from an ""accidental overdose of prescription drugs."" Following his Oscar-nominated performance in 'Brokeback Mountain (2005),' Ledger was at the cusp of the Hollywood A-list, and his performance here ∂? even without the higher pedestal bestowed to those recently passed ∂? would undoubtedly have rocketed his professional career to unprecedented heights. Ledger's Joker, a far cry from the high camp of Jack Nicholson's equally-memorable turn in 'Batman (1989),' is a chilling mix of Hannibal Lecter and Alex DeLarge, a cackling psychopathic clown who, despite his fondness for chaos, frequently engineers his schemes to uncanny perfection. Nolan deliberately avoids any back-story for Ledger's character, though The Joker himself offers two conflicting anecdotes, the result being that his villainous motives are disconcertingly ambiguous. As in 'Batman Begins,' the soundtrack composed by James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer is wonderfully moody and ominous, and Wally Pfister's shadowy cinematography serves the story well. Christopher Nolan's greatest talent lies, above all else, with setting the required mood. The atmosphere of Gotham City is consistently bleak and oppressive, a tone that only intensifies as The Joker begins to leave his mark on its residents. He possesses an anarchistic belief that, at heart, all humans are selfish and corruptible, and his disturbed social experiments ∂? extrapolated from the classic game theory of the Prisoner's Dilemma ∂? are designed to confirm this belief, that, in order to survive, ordinary people will commit seemingly unjustifiable atrocities. Whereas there might once have been a time when the residents of Gotham City would have detonated the opposite ferry, the influence and dedication of Harvey Dent has inspired citizens with a new optimistic spirit. Gotham's White Knight may have been corrupted by forces of evil, but his legacy remains, and that is more great a defeat than The Joker could have anticipated. "

What we are left with is cinema in its purest form, where acting is the sole driving-force of the narrative, and our attention is retained through the director's thorough exploitation of a bare-bones scenario. Sidney Lumet's debut feature-length film, '12 Angry Men (1957),' is quite simply one of the most arresting motion pictures I have ever seen, a veritable melting pot of gripping performances and impassioned monologues. With the exception of its bookends, and a brief scene in an adjacent washroom, the entire film unfolds exclusively within the one stifling, increasingly-claustrophobic jury room, as a group of twelve jurors {all male, mostly middle-aged and middle-class}, with vastly differing attitudes and prejudices, debate the innocence or guilt of a young Hispanic man charged with the premeditated stabbing murder of his father. Prior to 1957, director Sidney Lumet had already acquired some experience in television, though it wasn't until he released his first feature film, a low-budget offering shot in only 17 days, that he began to attract the attention of critics. Though '12 Angry Men' was commercially unsuccessful {in an age of lavish, technicolour adventures, David Lean's magnificent 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' was more to the taste of audiences of the day}, the film received three Oscar nominations, for Best Writing, Best Director and Best Picture. Of course, it was Lean's epic that won each of these categories, among numerous others. Lumet's film, adapted by Reginald Rose from his own 1954 Studio One teleplay, explores the fairness and infallibility of the American judicial system, and the ways by which personal prejudice may affect the outcome of a criminal case. Though the film opens at the conclusion of the hearing, as the apparently-bored judge (Rudy Bond) offers his final instructions to the jury members, the events of the trial are later recreated through dialogue, without ever resorting to cumbersome flashbacks or heavy-handed narration. What ultimately makes '12 Angry Men' such an electrifying viewing experience are the incredible performances of the twelve main actors, each player delivering a distinct, perfectly-pitched characterisation that contributes richly towards their jury's deliberations on the court-case. Central to the story, of course, is Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), the lone dissenting member, whose unwillingness to send a conceivably-innocent man to the electric chair forces the other jurors to reconsider their stance on what had initially seemed an ""open-and-shut case."" Fonda, who also co-produced the film, gives a sincere and righteous performance, his actions assuredly heroic, despite the very real possibility that he has helped a guilty criminal escape from justice. The remaining players (in clock-wise order around the juror's table: Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber) each contribute with faultless performances, though some play a more significant role in the proceedings than do others. It would be plain na«Óve to label any one of the twelve jurors a ""villain,"" but the man who clashes most frequently with the Fonda's well-meaning dissenter is Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb), a loud-mouthed and temperamental bully, whose failed relationship with his own adult son has given him an overwhelming prejudice towards young people. Rather than deciding the murder trial based on the evidence, Juror #3 subconsciously relies on his own tremendous bias to settle the eventual fate of the accused man. Equally bigoted is Juror #10 (Ed Begley), whose astonishing partiality is fully revealed in his final manic tirade against lower-class citizens. In one of the film's most brutally powerful sequences, the remaining jurors callously rise from their tables in response to Juror #10's deplorable outburst, his confidence shattering as he realises that he is alone in his narrow-minded views. Also interesting is Jack Warden's Juror #7, an impatient salesman, whose complete indifference to the fate of the Accused prompts him to alter his vote in favour of the majority. Despite working in an extremely confined space, Lumet certainly makes the most of his minimalist setting, and cinematographer Boris Kaufman {who also worked on 'On the Waterfront (1954)'} employed lenses with gradually-increasing focal lengths to make it seem as though the walls were closing in on the characters, heightening the ever-present sense of claustrophobia. Lumet is a master of creating mood, as he also demonstrated in his finest film, 'Fail-Safe (1964),' and there's a certain, illogical urgency in the jurors' proceedings, as though Fonda's character is continually fighting a losing battle. Though some of events of the jury room would technically not be allowed {Juror #8's extra investigations ∂? purchasing the knife, pacing the old witness' journey to the door ∂? would undoubtedly have resulted in a mistrial}, the discussions in the film work merely to prove a single, all-too-significant moral: according to the Constitution, the Accused can only be convicted if there exists no reasonable doubt of his guilt. Ultimately, whether he actually committed the murder or not is almost beside the point, particularly when the life of a potentially-innocent man is hanging in the balance. "
10732,tt0108052,ackstasis,australia,10,This list... is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf.,"The Holocaust is undoubtedly one of the most significant and horrifying events of the twentieth century. Between 1938 and 1945, the Jewish population was segregated and persecuted, culminating in the merciless slaughter of approximately six million Jews (this figure is quoted in the film, though most historical estimates vary between five and seven million). Amidst all this butchery, one man decided to make a difference, famously saving the lives of more than 1100 Jews- men, women and children who would otherwise have been killed. Oskar Schindler (played brilliantly by Liam Neeson, ""Batman Begins"") was a Sudeten German industrialist, a wealthy womanizer who wasn't afraid to throw his money around. Always bearing his Nazi Party badge proudly, Schindler would often frequent nightclubs, extravagantly showering high-ranked Nazi officers and their girlfriends with champagne and caviar. With impeccable connections in the black-market, there was little that he couldn't get his hands on, and he was a good person to know. Buying friends was something that Schindler could do well, and he would often use these newfound alliances to aid his own business ventures. When thousands of the Polish Jew population was relegated to the Krak«¸w Ghetto in 1941, Schindler saw an opportunity for further success, enlisting desperate Jewish investors and employing Jewish workers (who were substantially cheaper to employ) to open an enamelware factory. His connections in high places ensured lucrative army contracts, and Schindler need only have watched as his personal fortune grew, despite doing little to run the company beyond offering it ""a certain panache."" It is clear from the beginning that Oskar Schindler does not harbour any racial prejudices. When Schindler requests the services of Itzhak Stern (a superb Ben Kingsley, ""Gandhi""), a clever, humanitarian Jewish accountant, Stern declares that, ""By law I have to tell you, sir, I'm a Jew."" ""Well, I'm a German, so there we are,"" replies Schindler indifferently, before getting straight to business. It is not race that he is concerned with, it is himself∂? and, of course, his money. Stern does not enjoy running Schindler's business, and he initially acquires little satisfaction from it. When Schindler attempts to convey his genuine gratitude for his profitable services with a glass of whiskey, Stern absentmindedly refuses to drink it, and an embittered Schindler drinks it himself before ordering Stern to leave. With the arrival of Amon Goeth (played as the epitome of evil by Ralph Fiennes, ""Red Dragon""), a Hauptsturmf«¨hrer of the SS, the hopeless plight of the Jews grows darker. In a harrowing extended sequence, largely based on the testimonies of Holocaust survivors, the Jews are mercilessly ""liquidated"" from the Krakow Ghetto, many simply shot on the spot. ""Today is history,"" proclaims Goeth. ""Today will be remembered. Years from now the young will ask with wonder about this day. Today is history and you are part of it∂?. For six centuries there has been a Jewish Krakow. By this evening those six centuries will be a rumor. They never happened. Today is history."" This sequence also marks the celebrated appearance of the little girl in the red coat. An ingenious plot device, the character was based upon a real girl named Roma Ligocka who, unlike her film counterpart, survived the war, and wrote a memoir entitled ""The Girl in the Red Coat: A Memoir"". The embodiment of innocence, Schindler spots the small girl wandering amongst the black-and-white chaos of the Krakow Ghetto, and we follow her as she retreats into a building and takes shelter under a bed. When Schindler later notices her disheveled corpse carted past him to be incinerated, he is understandably horrified, unable to understand how the soldiers could possibly destroy something so innocent. This event memorably signifies the turning-point of Schindler's attitudes towards the carnage, fuelling his desire to save as many Jews as possible. Long known as a ""blockbuster"" filmmaker ∂? with such adventure classics as ""Jaws,"" ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"" and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" to his name - ""Schindler's List"" was - and remains - Steven Spielberg's most mature directorial effort. Working with a screenplay that Steven Zaillian adapted from Thomas Keneally's Booker Prize-winning 'Schindler's Ark,' Spielberg treats the subject matter with the respect it deserves. Wisely choosing to depict the events as realistically as possible, Spielberg allows the images to speak for themselves. Flawless acting, stunning cinematography and a haunting John Williams score excel this film above all others of the 1990s. This is the powerful story of the difference that just one man can make, and it is a story that deserves to be seen by all. We can only feel grateful that it was Steven Spielberg who chose to be at the helm. "
15061,tt0167260,ackstasis,australia,10,"Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?","For the past week, I'd been pining to complete my rewatch of ""The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003),"" viewing the films for the first time in years. This wait, however arduous, was nothing compared to the 360 days I originally endured between 'The Two Towers (2002)' and 'The Return of the King (2003).' The drought came to an end on December 26, 2003: I remember the exact date because it was the first night of release, and I'd been counting down for the past year. We bought our tickets weeks in advance, waited in line for over an hour, and my brother emptied a packet of jelly lollies over the row in front of us while trying to get the damn packet open. And so it is that Peter Jackson's trilogy-to-end-all-trilogies finally came to a close, in truly spectacular fashion. With the armies of Mordor marching on Minas Tirith, Gandalf (Ian McKellen) and Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) must recruit the aid of alternative reinforcements if the land of Gondor, ruled by the callous steward Denethor (John Noble), is not to fall before the Great Eye of Sauron. Meanwhile, this epic conflict is contrasted against the image of two little hobbits, Frodo and Sam, dutifully trundling across the wastelands of Mordor, two innocuous Halflings carrying the weight of a million men. Once again, the film excels at these stunning contrasts. The death of Denethor, a powerful, intimate moment of self-realisation, unexpectedly bridges into the Battle for Minas Tirith, the loss of one man suddenly absorbed into the slaughter of thousands. A word of warning: arachnophobics should be weary of Frodo's excursion into Shelob's Lair, a magnificent work of grotesquerie visual effects, topped only by the ""insect pit"" in Jackson's own 'King Kong (2005).' Andy Serkis, as the computer-generated Gollum, once again brings pathos and fragility into the role of the tormented former Ring-bearer. 'The Return of the King' has perhaps the most unforgettable final hour I've ever seen, as the fate of all that is good comes down to a scrappy scuffle on the edge of a fiery precipice, this one-on-one conflict somehow more ""epic"" than the entire Battle of Helms Deep. But Peter Jackson isn't done yet. While excising Tolkien's somewhat anti-climactic ""Scouring of the Shire,"" he nevertheless brings the trilogy to a graceful, and wonderfully satisfying, close, his leisurely winding-down approach doing justice to one of the richest fantasy sagas ever told.

16031,tt0060196,ackstasis,australia,10,"You may run the risks, my friend, but I do the cutting","This week I was fortunate enough to see 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966)' (namely, the 2003 extended English-language version) in the cinema, perhaps the only place that Sergio Leone's classic Spaghetti Western can be properly appreciated. This was my second viewing ∂? the first being in 2006, when my interest in cinema was still in its infancy ∂? and, just as Leone's film gained status only in subsequent decades, my admiration has since grown substantially. By the early 1960s, the Western had become a tired genre, and even the best American entries {such as Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)'} could more closely be described as somber rather than thrilling. Leone's low-budget Italian productions breathed new life into the Western, the director's highly-stylised (and purely cinematic) film-making style tackling the recently-emerged Revisionist Western sub-genre with a cheekily-parodic sense of humour. Though 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' clearly identifies each of its three protagonists with a titular adjective, the separating lines are decidedly blurred. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the archetypal anti-hero, a laconic, cigar-smoking bounty-hunter who makes every word, and every bullet, count. Tuco (Eli Wallach) is a slimy opportunist, a bottom-dweller whose unabashed enthusiasm ∂? especially opposite the apathetic Eastwood ∂? makes him an oddly-likable character. Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is a crafty, intelligent schemer, greed and contempt mixing behind those cold, steely eyes. Leon's film revolves almost exclusively around these three characters, and the American Civil War is utilised purely as a historical backdrop. As was the director's style, the film is a triumph of contrasts: an epic period of American history is used merely as a stage for an intimate battle-of-wills between three determined men with their own selfish aims. Contrast, too, is evident through Leone's camera lens. Few directors (perhaps David Lean or Sergei Bondarchuk are his only true rivals in this field) have more inspiringly utilised the cinema screen as a canvas. Leone switches between landscapes and portraits, at times cutting unexpectedly from a distant long-shot to an extreme close-up of Eastwood's sweaty brow, his eyes narrowed and alert. I wrote in my review for 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' that that Leone's landscape was the human face. Unlike Ford, to whom setting was significant (one reason why he so adored Monument Valley), Leone's Westerns unfold in an anonymous landscape, dry and unremarkable and unforgiving. Colour is instead injected through Ennio Morricone's score, perhaps the most memorable ever composed for a film. The composer's contribution is uniquely cinematic, refusing to linger in the background and instead serving to overwhelm and enhance Leone's imagery.  "
18417,tt0137523,ackstasis,australia,9,A Great Film,"If there was ever an award for the ""coolest"" film ever made, it is fairly certain that 'Fight Club' would emerge with the honours. With its slick production design, its rebellious attitudes towards consumerism and authority, and an evident parallel with classic Nietzschian philosophy, the film received the admiration of a large proportion of its younger audience. Additionally, a cast of talented and instantly likable actors, and an excellent electronic score from The Dust Brothers, excels this film above others of its kind. Edward Norton ('Red Dragon,' 2002) plays the unnamed Narrator, an emotionally-unsatisfied car-company employee, who is suffering from debilitating insomnia and feels as if his life is going to waste. He discovers momentary relief from his troubles through attending regular medical support groups for diseases that he doesn't have. However, his dissatisfaction returns with the arrival of another ""faker"" named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter, 'Big Fish,' 2003). It is then that Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt, 'Ocean's 11,' 2001) enters his life. After introducing themselves on a plane, the Narrator finds his high-rise apartment engulfed in an explosion of unknown cause and, having nobody else to call, he seeks temporary lodging at Durden's crumbling and isolated residence. 'Fight Club' is a superb film, and it's almost impossible not to like it. Edward Norton delivers a stand-out performance as the vulnerable and very confused Narrator, as he struggles to explore the notion of his own identity. This is a must-see film, and a second viewing to uncover the finer points of the story is highly recommended.  "
19894,tt0120737,ackstasis,australia,10,For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the fortunes of all,"Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy (2001-03) is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time (perhaps second only to Sergei Bondarchuk's ""War and Peace (1967)'), and played such an immense role in my adolescence that the two years I had to wait to experience its conclusion were as painful as they were gratifying. I'm about to take you on a trip down memory-lane, so bear with me. I first saw 'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' in late January 2002, long after everybody else I knew, owing to a family holiday that nevertheless allowed me to familiarise myself with Tolkien's primary Middle-Earth literature. I greatly enjoyed the novels, and have certainly re-read them since, but this movie was something else. I was immediately transfixed by its magnificent locations, exciting characters, epic scope, and, above all else, its attention to detail. Jackson's prologue gracefully traverses 3000 years of Middle-Earth history, settling finally on the halflings of The Shire, a race of little-people so satisfied with their quaint lifestyles that the goings-on of men and elves are of little consequence to them. It's this balance of the epic and the intimate that makes these films so special. Every time I watch 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' I notice something different: the three frozen trolls of Bilbo's tale; the hobbits' hairy, shoeless feet; the glowing of Frodo's ""Sting"" blade whenever orcs are close. Each of the film's characters remain true to Tolkien's original stories. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin) are self-doubting but courageous, as yet oblivious to the roles they will play in shaping Middle-Earth's history. Gandalf (Ian McKellen) projects incredible power and wisdom, but it is infused by the weariness of an old man, the mental ravages of millennia passed. Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) is a valiant wanderer, and the last surviving member of a shattered royal bloodline, an ancestry that seems to affirm his own downfall. Supporting stars Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Billy Boyd, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Dominic Monaghan, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, and Hugo Weaving round out the cast, each contributing their own spark of personality into this magnificent world of fantastic creatures and terrific evil. Peter Jackson has asserted that his favourite film is 'King Kong (1933),' a prime motivating factor in his decision to direct his own excellent remake in 2005. Both films capture the awe and wonderment of their respective fantasy-worlds, though 'The Lord of the Rings' is even deeper entrenched in a sort of historical mythology, fuelled by a Tolkien legendarium that seems to stretch far beyond even the film's epic scope. We're all inspired by something. I like to describe myself as an amateur filmmaker, a hobby I've maintained for the best part of ten years. I'd already picked up a video camera by the time I saw 'The Fellowship of the Ring' in January 2002, but my prolonged enthusiasm for film-making came from the realisation that movies could be this amazing.

His below-average IQ has restricted him (some might say protected him) from understanding the intricacies of the world he inhabits, and so he is oblivious to the hate and prejudice of American society. Robert Zemeckis (Cast Away, Back To The Future) and multiple academy-award winner Tom Hanks (Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan) present us with the world as seen through the eyes of Forrest Gump, in one of the most powerful stories ever committed to screen. Though he may not be the smartest person in the world, Forrest Gump has achieved some amazing things. Aside from meeting three different American presidents and becoming a world ping-pong champion, Forrest has also been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour for his courage during the Vietnam War, run across the country several times over (because he ""just felt like running""), inspired Elvis Presley to invent a new type of dance and exposed the Watergate scandal. At the heart of the film is a love-story. Forrest and his life-long companion, Jenny (Robin Wright Penn- Hurlyburly, The Singing Detective), are two completely different people, and Jenny knows that he deserves better, but Forrest loves her anyway. ""I'm not a smart man,"" Forrest declares. ""But I know what love is."" The acting in this film is nothing short of perfect. Tom Hanks demonstrates how he will win his second Best Actor Oscar with this performance. Nobody else could have possibly portrayed Forrest so perfectly. The supporting cast is strong. Robin Wright Penn is good, and Gary Sinise gives the best performance of his career as Lieutenant Dan Taylor. ""... Life is a box of chocolates,"" Forrest announces at the beginning of the film. ""You never know what you are going to get."" This film is exactly that. Through the eyes of Forrest Gump, you will laugh, and you will cry. This life's journey is one that you will never forget.  "
26522,tt1375666,ackstasis,australia,8,An elegant solution for keeping track of reality,"Inception (2010) Christopher Nolan has often explored the relationship between human perception and reality. 'Memento (2000)' was told backwards, forcing the viewer to rely upon the damaged first-person memory of its amnesiac protagonist. 'The Prestige (2006)' concerned misdirection and trickery, highlighting the role of the movie director as a magician, a shyster, a charlatan, deftly blurring the line between what the viewer is shown, and what actually is. Even 'Batman Begins (2004),' via the Scarecrow's creepy hallucinogenic toxin, hinted at how the human mind could unwittingly distort one's perception of reality. 'Inception (2010)' once again brings Nolan into familiar territory, an action film dripping with metaphysical philosophy: what is a dream? Why do we dream? And are you dreaming right now? Philip K. Dick succinctly described reality as ""that which, when you stop believing it, doesn't go away."" Our dreams are manufactured realities that seem every bit as expansive and convincing as our everyday lives, namely because the brain shuts off the segment of our brains responsible for logic (indeed, in one dream, I've walked through my front door, come out into a football stadium, and thought nothing of it). Who's to know whether or not I'll wake up in 70 years time, laugh to myself, and think ""blue skies? How absurd!"" Shifting levels of consciousness have become common fodder in science-fiction (see, for example, 'Dark City (1998)' and 'The Matrix (1999),' but here I loved how Nolan twisted and warped the fabric of his cinematic universe like an Escher lithograph. Buildings leans and distorts; gravity shifts or disappears; in one particularly magnificent sequence, the Paris skyline seems to fold in upon itself, encapsulating ""reality"" into a self-contained cube.

28407,tt0167261,ackstasis,australia,10,"All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits, somewhere in the wilderness","I've always considered 'The Two Towers (2002)' to be the black-sheep of the ""Lord of the Rings"" family; still completely amazing, of course, but perhaps less so than the two instalments that bookend it. Whereas 'The Fellowship of the Ring (2001)' is an episodic introduction into the breathtaking world of Middle-Earth, and 'The Return of the King (2003)' is the climax to which the entire trilogy builds, 'The Two Towers' has neither a concrete beginning nor end. On initial viewings, the film seemed to centre on the Battle of Helms Deep, an epic conflict that pits a few hundred men and elves against Saruman's 10,000-strong Uruk-hai army. If the theatrical cut of 'The Two Towers' lacked the narrative depth of its siblings, then the Extended Edition ∂? which I watched this week for the first time ∂? rectifies any such shortcomings, breathing new life into the lands of Rohan, Gondor, and their human inhabitants. Most significantly, Faramir (David Wenham) is given a back-story that makes clearer his motivations, via an extensive flashback featuring his father, Denethor (John Noble), and brother Boromir (Sean Bean). The newly-introduced characters are no less three-dimensional than their more familiar counterparts: Brad Dourif as Grima Wormtongue, Saruman's grovelling, serpentine apprentice; Miranda Otto as Eowyn, a pro-feministic noblewoman lusting for glory; Bernard Hill as Theoden, the King of Rohan, and possessed by the treacherous hand of Isengard. Unlike its predecessor, 'The Two Towers' is split into three parallel story lines, but once again balances the epic and intimate, abruptly (but never jarringly) cutting between the epic battles of Aragorn and Co., and the slow, tortured trampling of Frodo, Sam and their slippery little guide (played by Andy Serkis in a rotoscope suit). I recall that, when the 'The Two Towers' was first released back in 2002, Gollum was the main focus of reviewers' attention, and I was pleased to discover that the technology utilised in the CGI-character's creation remains completely authentic and convincing. Serkis, despite never actually appearing on screen, brings an astonishing depth to the character, highlighting Smeagol/Gollum's schizophrenia by subtly altering his voice, posture and mannerisms. I'm about to take another trip down memory-lane, so bear with me again. When I first saw 'The Two Towers' at the cinemas ∂? in the last week of 2002 ∂? I remember telling a friend that I preferred the first instalment, because it was ""more about the ring."" While it's true that the second film somewhat relegates Frodo and Sam's struggles to the sidelines, one must consider the bigger picture. 'The Two Towers' takes Tolkien's Middle-Earth beyond the guise of a simple fantasy world, and, with its vast scope and attention-to-detail, almost convinces us of its historical authenticity. I still recall emerging from the blackened cinema satisfied with where the trilogy was heading, but horrified at the prospect of waiting an entire year for the story's conclusion. Well, I waited... but no longer than I had to. At least I'll only be waiting a week this time around.  "

34077,tt0317248,ackstasis,australia,8,What should have been swift revenge turned into an all out war. The City of God was divided.,"Planned and executed by the state government of Guanabara, the quarter of Cicade de Deus (City of God) was built in 1960 as part of a policy to remove all favelas (shanty towns; slums) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ""We came to the City of God hoping to find paradise,"" reminisces Rocket, our narrator. ""Many families were homeless due to flooding and acts of arson in the slums∂? the big wigs in government didn't joke around. Homeless? Off to City of God!"" Nowadays, Cicade de Deus is infamous as a high crime quarter, rife with social problems. ""There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation. But for the powerful, our problems didn't matter. We were far too removed from the picture postcard image of Rio de Janeiro."" Fernando Meirelles and K«≠tia Lund's acclaimed Brazilian film ""City of God"" dares to veer from this ""postcard image"" of Brazilian life, creating an intense and uncompromising glimpse at life in the violent and drug-infested slums at the heart of the city. The story, which spans the 1960s and 1970s, follows two parallel lives in the Cicade de Deus. Rocket is a quiet, honest boy who dreams of becoming a photographer. Whilst nobody in this city is truly innocent, Rocket perhaps comes closest. His father was a fishmonger, and the older brother he respects, Clipper, is a hood (short for hoodlum) who ∂? with two other close friends, Goose and Shaggy - forms the Tender Trio, who acquire their money through theft. The second child is Li'l Dice, who will later rise to be known as Li'l Z«∏. An ambitious young boy who often trails the Tender Trio, Li'l Dice attains his first experience of murder via a shockingly revelational flashback. Li'l Dice subsequently grows to become the dominant drug dealer in Cicade de Deus, after successfully eliminating most of his competition and taking over their businesses. Perhaps the first thing you'll notice about this film is that it is visually stunning. C«∏sar Charlone's beautiful hand-held camera-work perfectly captures the beauty and horror of Cicade de Deus' chaotic everyday occurrences. Whilst sometimes you feel that the camera darts all over the place unnecessarily, this also offers the film a documentary-like feel, brutally reminding you that this is based on a true story. 'City of God' is an unapologetically intense film, and it certainly is not for the faint of heart. The overwhelming combination of violence, drugs and rape (and the very idea that children as young as ten or so were taking part in all of this) made me nauseous at times, and I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was a rewarding experience, and I'm glad that I did watch it, but I can't say it was fun. In fact, I felt quite depressed afterwards. Yes, I suppose this just isn't my sort of movie. For what it's worth, I much preferred watching Fernando Meirelles' follow-up film, 'The Constant Gardener' (2005).  "

I have absolutely no hesitation in proclaiming 'Se7en' to be such a film, with director David Fincher ∂? after achieving a somewhat mixed result in his cinematic debut, 'Alien∂¸' ∂? firmly proclaiming his place as one of the 1990's most promising new talents. It's somewhat surprising that the movie had managed to elude me for so long, since I'd been wanting to see it for a while, and it was only last week that I managed to get my hands on a DVD copy. And so, without further ado, I invited over a friend, who has an equal partiality towards good thrillers, and enthusiastically promised him one of the best of its decade. 'Se7en' didn't disappoint. The film takes place in a dark, gritty, unnamed metropolis, where it is always raining and danger looms ominously from every alleyway. Reserved and hardened Detective Lt. William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) has seen it all in his lifetime, and is finally preparing to retire to the country, away from the madness of the city. His replacement, impulsive Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt), has transferred here at his own request, and is eager to make his mark, even though his career choice could be harming the wellbeing of his lonely and vulnerable wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow). Both detectives are soon drawn into the case of a serial killer, John Doe, who is ritualistically murdering his victims according to the Seven Deadly Sins: gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath. As the murders begin piling up, the two detectives' investigation becomes an obsession, and the inevitable outcome will drastically change the lives of both. Throughout the film, Brad Pitt provides most of the comic relief, none of which detracts at all from the horrors we are witnessing on screen. David Fincher has a unique visual style that is simply thrilling to watch. Despite the thematically dark tone of the story, the film itself is positively brimming with invigorating and vibrantly-contrasted colour and lighting. The graphic murder scenes appear to splash out of the screen, before our very eyes, enhancing the feelings of dread and repulsion that accompany John Doe's horrific acts of murder. The rich, highly-stylised use of colour also helps create a memorable atmosphere of sheer foreboding; the imagery is sure to stay with you for many years to come. Even as 'Se7en' abandons the gritty setting of the city for the final act ∂? shifting the action to a starkly-lit open field beside a trail of electric power-lines ∂? the film loses none of its potency, the isolation of the climactic arena seemingly leaving our main protagonists even more helpless and vulnerable than before. Our villain is anonymously titled John Doe, and is played with delightful creepiness by Kevin Spacey, who only agreed to the part under the condition that he remain unbilled in the promotion and opening credits of the film. Unlike your typical serial killer, John Doe is not a crazy, impulsive and stupid mad-man, but something rather more terrifying: he is intelligent, patient and methodical. In one particularly ghastly crime, he keeps a convicted drug dealer chained to his bed for an entire year, removing his hands and his tongue, and regularly paying his rent so as to not arouse any suspicions. John Doe's entire life has been dedicated to Mankind's obsession with committing sin, and, through orchestrating his crimes, he wishes to preach to the society of their transgressions. John Doe, rather uniquely, is given a large portion of the film's final half-hour, and so he becomes a character that we come to know very well, as opposed to the half-constructed serial killers who usually turn up in the final five minutes only to be shot by the hero. Spacey is very good in the role, though I can't help but feel that his performance would have been even more effective had I not been familiar with much of his later film work. The most exciting scene in the film is undoubtedly the hectic foot-chase that ensues when John Doe arrives home to his apartment, only to find Detectives Somerset and Mills waiting patiently outside his door. However, the film's climax is also well worth mentioning: though many interpretations have been floating around, my view is that the final two victims are John Doe himself (""Envy"") and David Mills (""Wrath""). In order to prevent himself from being labeled a hypocrite, as Mills had suggested during the car-ride, Doe allowed his own deadly sin - envy - to result in the death of Tracy, and so enticed Mills to shoot him, simultaneously becoming the sixth victim and prompting Mills to commit the seventh sin. Some have argued that, since Mills didn't die, he can't be perceived as one of Doe's victims, but is being left alive in these circumstances perhaps even a more diabolical punishment?  "
35438,tt0102926,ackstasis,australia,10,"Don't you feel eyes moving over your body, Clarice?","'The Silence of the Lambs (1991)' isn't even about Hannibal Lecter. We're so distracted by cold, probing voice of the suave psychiatrist- turned-serial-killer (played with chilling calculation by Anthony Hopkins) that it's easy to forget that the film is ultimately about Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), a rookie FBI agent with a dark past. Clarice spent her adolescence trying to escape death ∂? the shooting of her father, the slaughter of spring lambs on her neighbour's ranch ∂? and sought to banish these memories by joining the FBI. She's a young woman in what is traditionally a man's world, forced to endure the degradation of constantly having ""eyes all over her body"" (and this disquieting metaphor is reinforced later on as we witness Clarice ogled through the lens of night-vision goggles). The motives of her boss and mentor Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) are somewhat dubious, and their final handshake quivers with sexual awkwardness. Hannibal Lecter perceives Clarice's dark past and recognises her strengths. He falls in love with her in a platonic sort of way (not dissimilar to how Sherlock Holmes fell in love with Irene Adler, one of the few people to have outwitted him, in ""A Scandal in Bohemia""). The moment that their fingers touch through the bars of Lecter's cell is a chilling sharing of intimacy. Thomas Harris subsequently elaborated on this relationship in ""Hannibal,"" but that novel (and, to a lesser extent, Ridley Scott's 2001 film adaptation) goes completely off the rails in its final act. Clarice Starling would've been best left alone. (Tellingly, the best parts of 'Hannibal (2001)' were those set in Florence, Italy with Giancarlo Giannini). Finally, nobody ever mentions Ted Levine's perfect performance as Jame Gumb (a.k.a. Buffalo Bill), probably because he's such an repellent character. Lecter is frequently framed in close-up, emphasising Hopkins' mesmerising, unblinking stare, and he speaks eloquently and intelligently. Jame Gumb, conversely, is kept at a distance, often swathed in poor or garish lighting, or framed in such an extreme close- up that his features appear grotesque.  "
36436,tt0038650,ackstasis,australia,10,"A toast to my big brother, George: The richest man in town","Why is it that I get a little teary every time I watch 'It's A Wonderful Life (1946)?' The title says it all, I suppose. Despite the film's reputation as a holiday classic, Capra's film succeeds because it doesn't forget about the other eleven months of the year ∂? it truly is about life, and what makes it wonderful. Even the most understated moments have a tendency to expose me as a romantic: in one of my favourite scenes, George Bailey (James Stewart) offers the Moon to his sweetheart, Mary (Donna Reed). Yet Capra doesn't patronise the audience with a string of happy moments. George, at first, seems like the unluckiest person in town, a man whose big dreams never came to fruition, for reasons entirely outside his control. It is Capra's miracle that George, and the audience, ultimately realise that life's greatest wonders are not necessarily those that we had anticipated ∂? friends we never expected to make, a girl with whom we never expected to fall in love∂? On a snowy Christmas Eve, George Bailey stands on a bridge in his home town of Bedford Falls, contemplating suicide. Throughout his life-time, George's grand dreams of exploration and excitement have been repeatedly stifled by tragedy and obligation, and now he sees no future except in death. God, watching from Heaven, sends down guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers), who tries to convince George that life is something to be treasured. 'It's a Wonderful Life' was adapted from Philip Van Doren Stern's short story ""The Greatest Gift,"" and carries shades of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"" (indeed, Lionel Barrymore was chosen for the role of Mr. Potter based on his much-lauded radio portrayals of Scrooge from 1934). James Stewart, who had served in the U.S. Airforce during WWII, brings a painful weariness to the role of beleaguered family-man George Bailey, and the warm, soulful eyes of Donna Reed ∂? as George's wife Mary ∂? are enough to remind any man that life is, indeed, wonderful. 'It's A Wonderful Life' differs from 'You Can't Take It With You (1938)' and 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939)' in that the film's central immoral character does not undergo a change of heart (though, admittedly, Jim Taylor in the latter film does remain a rigid villain, even when Senator Paine reveals a human streak). Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) is one of cinema's most formidable villains, a heaving bulk of a man, confined to a wheelchair, who desires money and power for the sake of money and power. In the swelling emotion of Capra's final act, it's easy to forget that Potter goes unpunished for his moral crimes. Here, Capra deals in blacks and whites. George Bailey is a good man; Mr Potter is a bad man. The director's own unique brand of ""Capra-corn"" required that the audience's sympathies never be confused, so that they can commit themselves to a character who is destined for a happy ending. After having watched 'You Can't Take It With You,' Barrymore's role- reversing characterisation is stunning.  "
38059,tt0118799,ackstasis,australia,9,This is a simple story... but not an easy one to tell.,"For the last 60 years, films regarding the Holocaust have had to tread carefully. It is truly a horrifying and disheartening period in Mankind's history, and, quite evidently, little humour could possibly be derived from it. Perhaps the last mainstream film to attempt such a thing was Charles Chaplin's classic 1940 satire, 'The Great Dictator,' which memorably spoofed Hitler and his Nazi regime, and poignantly highlighted the plight of the Jews. Indeed, Chaplin's film was released approximately a year before the true Nazi death camps, such as Auschwitz, were constructed, and Chaplin would later state in his 1964 autobiography, had he known the actual extent of the Holocaust's horrors, he could never have made such jokes about the Nazi regime. It would take until 1997 that a film dared to try again. Popular Italian comedy entertainer Roberto Benigni co-wrote, directed and starred in 'La Vita «˘ bella' (Life is Beautiful), a truly heartwarming wartime tale of love, family, courage and imagination. The film made an international star out of Benigni, with 'La Vita «˘ bella' winning three 1999 Academy Awards (including Best Actor and Best Foreign Film), and nominated for a further four (including Best Picture and Best Director). Though I find it difficult to judge a performance in which an actor is not speaking English, there is no denying that Benigni does a terrific job as both actor and director. His surprise Best Actor Oscar win was only the second time a performance completely in Italian had been awarded (after Sophia Loren for ""La Ciociara"" (1960)). The first half of the film contains not a hint of the war, and acts as the genuinely entertaining story of Guido Orefice's (Benigni) whimsical attempts to romance a beautiful Italian teacher named Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), whom he calls ""Princess."" Guido's exploits contain a large amount of innocent slapstick, evoking fond memories of Chaplin's antics sixty years earlier, and it is truly a pleasure to watch. We gaze in wonder as he continually meets his ""Princess"" in the most unexpected of places, whether she falls from the sky and into his arms, he arrives at her school pretending to be an Aryan inspector, or as he serves as a waiter at her engagement ∂? to a loud and rude bank manager with a certain attraction to eggs. After Guido ""rescues"" Dora from her unwanted marriage, riding her out of the engagement party atop of a green-painted steed named Robin Hood, we cut to five years later, and the two lovers are now married, with a bright and curious child named Giosu«∏ (written Joshua in the English subtitles), delightfully played by the young Giorgio Cantarini, in his screen debut. On the boy's birthday, Guido and Giosu«∏ are captured by the Nazis and herded onto a train to be transported to a concentration camp. Not being Jewish, Dora is spared such a fate, but she insists that she be taken also, unwilling to abandon her family. In an effort to protect his young son from the horrors taking place around him, Guido cheerfully pretends that the entire concentration camp set-up is a huge game, with the ultimate prize going to the first team to score 1000 points ∂? the ultimate prize being a real, fully-working tank. Young Giosu«∏'s imagination is captured by such a prospect, and he enthusiastically sets about winning 1st prize, his daily duties largely involving remaining hidden and silent on the top bunk of a set of beds. Meanwhile, Guido spends his days performing gritty slave labour, lugging hefty anvils considerable distances, all the while detailing to Giosu«∏ the phenomenal time he had playing hop-scotch and tug-of-war. Whenever Giosu«∏ occasionally expresses his disbelief in the authenticity of his father's explanation, Guido is always able to sway him back. ""How ridiculous. They were just teasing you!"" exclaims he, when Giosu«∏ reveals what he had overhead from a sobbing old man. ""There are wood ovens, but there are no people ovens. Putting people in ovens creates too much smoke!"" The weary, disheartened Jews in the adjoining beds do their very best to perpetuate Guido's glorious fa«ıade. In one highly-amusing incident, to put his son's doubts at ease, Guido volunteers to translate a speech from one of the bad-tempered Nazis ∂? the ""rude men who yell"" ∂? despite not speaking a word of German, substituting the actual speech with the stern rules to his supposed game. There's no doubt that 'La Vita «˘ bella' shields the audience from most of the horrors of the Holocaust ∂? no deaths are actually shown. Indeed, with the exception of one, no deaths are explicitly implied, with most of the murders lying deep in the subtext, only apparent due to our knowledge of history. The death of Jewish children should have been a heart wrenching moment in the film, but somehow Benigni manages to gloss over it. Giosu«∏ comes running to his father during the day, declaring that he refuses to take a shower as he has been told. We immediately recognise that the remainder of the children must now have been led to the gas chambers, but we do not dwell on it. The wider focus of the Holocaust is simply not what this film is about ∂? it is about a loving father and his desire to protect his family with the most powerful weapon he possesses, his sense of humour and imagination.

41621,tt0064116,ackstasis,australia,9,"When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground","Sergio Leone may not have chosen the high-brow subject subject matter of his 1960s European contemporaries, but, boy, his films are pure cinema. Leone may have progressed beyond the charming but erratic editing style of his earliest Westerns ∂? 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' and 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)' ∂? but his use of the camera is unlike any other filmmaker I've ever seen. The director's wide frame, captured in Techniscope, is like a freshly-painted canvas, its watercolours glistening under the intense Western sun, and style dripping from every shot. Mostly gone is the slightest hint of parody that I observed in his earlier films; Ennio Morricone's score, rather than being joyously overwhelming as in 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (1966),' instead meditates gracefully on the passions and losses of its major characters. This added grace recognisable throughout the film emerges no doubt from a far greater budget, the film bankrolled by Paramount Pictures and shot largely in the United States {with Leone paying tribute to John Ford through the use of his favoured Monument Valley}. Leone has stated that ""the rhythm of the film was intended to create the sensation of the last gasps that a person takes just before dying."" That most of his set-pieces end in a bloody shootout suggests the aptness of this analogy. However, like Leone says, the heart of his pictures is not to be found in the moment of death ∂? however gratifying we may find it ∂? but in the final gasps for air. 'Once Upon a Time in the West' opens with an astonishing ten-minute prologue in which three armed outlaws (Woody Strode, Jack Elam and Al Mulock) impatiently await the arrival of a train. The minutes pass by almost without dialogue. In the sweltering heat, the men lazily brush away flies; a windmill creaks as it spins idly in the breeze; a telegraph machine chatters inside the railway station. This simple act of waiting, in less talented hands, could easily have been tedious, but Leone rejects the standard perceptions of time by allowing the viewer to immerse themselves in the canvas that he has just painted. These minutes of waiting become a Danse Macabre - the final moments these three men will ever know. As in the director's previous effort, the film's main characters blur the line between ""good"" and ""bad"" (and ""ugly""), but the clear villain of the piece is, memorably, Henry Fonda as Frank. His against-type performance is wonderful, not because it's a far cry from his usual persona, but because it isn't. Close your eyes, and you'll hear that same righteous drawl that spoke with such rectitude in '12 Angry Men (1957).' But Juror #8 he certainly isn't; Fonda adds a nasty, sadistic sneer, and Leone focuses most closely on the actor's hypnotic blue eyes. It's almost frightening how Fonda's squeaky-clean persona can be corrupted so readily. Claudia Cardinale plays Jill McBain, a stunning widower who refuses to bow down to those who murdered her husband and his family. Morricone's score only has good things to say about Jill, but Leone appears to admire her precisely because she, like her male cohorts, is not a hapless innocent. A former prostitute, this lady from New Orleans has absolutely no qualms about sleeping with the enemy. No pride, only objectives ∂? that's how you survive in the West.  "
45696,tt0034583,ackstasis,australia,10,"I remember every detail. The Germans wore grey, you wore blue.","Ah, 'Casablanca.' What other film can evoke such powerful feelings of nostalgia, can exemplify so completely the golden period of Hollywood film-making? The year was 1942, and the world found itself in the midst of the bloodiest conflict in modern history. Unlike anything our generation could possibly imagine, citizens were faced with an incredible uncertainty about their future. The Nazis marched across Europe, an astonishing, seemingly-unstoppable enemy, and the United States watched with bated breath from across the Atlantic. Most Hollywood productions responded to such ambiguity with fully-fledged, unabashed patriotism, and war-time filmmakers became obsessed with validating audiences' beliefs that the Allied forces would inevitably win out against Germany, and, indeed, many often concluded their pictures with unnecessary epilogues in which we've apparently already won. Such propaganda, while no doubt ensuring commercial success from war-weary cinema-goers, has regularly tarnished and outdated even the most otherwise-impressive contemporary WWII pictures, as the directors' willingness to simulate a happy ending strikes distinctly false from an era in which the overwhelming atmosphere was that of uncertainty and insecurity (see Billy Wilder's 'Five Graves to Cairo (1943)). This is not to say that 'Casablanca (1942)' is not a work of American patriotism; indeed, it might just be the greatest example. The film owes its enduring legacy to how seamlessly director Michael Curtiz, and his troupe of writers and actors, was able to encapsulate the sentiment of the time in which the picture was made. The story ends with Rick and Renault strolling resolutely into the thick mist, their futures obscured by the fog of uncertainty that hovers before their faces. What will the next few turbulent years have in store for these heroes? Will they be overwhelmed by the enemy, or continue their noble fight for freedom? Following Operation Torch, the 1942 Allied invasion of North Africa, there were plans to film one of those dreaded propagandistic epilogues, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship. Owing to Claude Rains' fortuitous unavailability for filming, the original ending was left intact, and producer David O. Selznick was never more correct than when he concluded ""it would be a terrible mistake to change the ending."" When 'Casablanca' was first conceived, the filmmakers apparently had little idea they were about to produce one of cinema's best-loved pictures. A prime example of the studio-bound exotica that was popular at the time, and obviously a war-time off-shoot of Howard Hawks' Colombian aviation adventure 'Only Angels Have Wings (1939)' ∂? perhaps also John Cromwell's 'Algiers (1938),' which I unfortunately haven't seen ∂? the film reproduced the stuffy, humid climate and seedy, corrupt personalities of Morocco on the Warner Bros. sets, which ironically communicate more romantic charm than the real location could ever have provided. The film was shot by veteran cinematographer Arthur Edeson, who had previously worked on the wonderfully-atmospheric 'All Quiet on the Western Front (1930),' 'Frankenstein (1931)' and 'The Maltese Falcon (1941).' His perfectly-framed photography suggests a mixture of stuffy melodrama, glamorous adventure and shadowy noir, though, interestingly, he avoids the sordidness of the latter style's successors, despite the wealth of suitably-seedy characters to be found in Casablanca. Framed through Edeson's lens, it seems that even the most squalid and repulsive of personalities can take on a curious facade of nobility. No less than six people had a hand in the film's justly-celebrated screenplay. The story was based on a then-unproduced play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, ""Everybody Comes to Rick's,"" and was adapted for the screen by Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch, with uncredited input by Casey Robinson. The Epstein twins were initially keen to give the film a few comedic elements; this would, no doubt, have made for entertaining viewing, not unlike a Howard Hawks picture, but might have detracted from the story's core themes of love, loyalty, regret, moral responsibility and self-sacrifice. Koch had perhaps a clearer understanding of the director's preferences ∂? another wonderful film from Curtiz, 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),' also poses a vital moral dilemma ∂? and chose to focus largely on the politics and melodrama of Burnett and Alison's play. That so many conflicting artistic ideas somehow melded together, not only into a cohesive narrative, but also into history's greatest screenplay, is a miracle to be credited only to the cinema gods, particularly in view of the fact that Curtiz commenced filming with an incomplete script that was updated daily. Perhaps another possible explanation for the film's unlikely legacy lies with the distinguished cast, borrowed from all over Europe. Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson and Joy Page were the sole American ""imports,"" and assorted supporting talents were plundered from the United Kingdom (Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet), Sweden (Ingrid Bergman), Austria (Paul Henreid), Hungary (Peter Lorre) and even Germany (Conrad Veidt). Bogart, who had been typecast throughout the 1930s as a lowlife gangster, had been given the opportunity to show some humanity in Raoul Walsh' film noir 'High Sierra (1941),' but it was 'Casablanca' that proved his first genuinely romantic role, and, with several notable exceptions, the remainder of his acting career would comprise of similarly-noble yet flawed heroes. Bergman, despite having a rather passive role, was never more enchanting than as Ilsa Lund, and, photographed with a softening gauze filter and catch lights, positively sparkles with gentle compassion and a tragic sadness. Perhaps it's just the romantic in me, but 'Casablanca' represents one of Hollywood's most unforgettable accomplishments. Even as the film draws to a majestic close, and two men forge a lifelong friendship in the fog-ridden uncertainty of War, we immediately feel like asking Sam to play it again∂? just for old time's sake.

46435,tt0054215,ackstasis,australia,10,"She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.","June, 1960. The movie theatre is quiet; 45 minutes ago, the halls were buzzing with anticipation, but not anymore. Nobody has been allowed into the cinema since the picture began, and the audience is dead quiet. Through the walls of the theatre, one can hear the muffled whirr of running water. Silence. An indistinct shadow is seen approaching through the curtain. Accompanied by the fierce screech of violins, hundreds of voices suddenly utter a deafening chorus of horrified shock; some patrons collapse into the aisle. Bernard Hermann continues to pound the violin with extraordinary intensity, and a bloody streak carves its path towards the drainpipe. Audience members reel with a frantic mixture of stunned confusion and gripping fear. The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, has just painted the most extraordinary masterstroke of his distinguished career. The simple act of taking a shower will never again be the same. Though he produced many films that could justifiably be considered masterpieces, it is unlikely that Hitchcock ever directed anything more popular and influential than 'Psycho (1960).' The first of only two Hitchcock horror films, it shocked many with its unique narrative structure, and the infamous ""shower scene"" has become permanently imprinted in the movie-going public's collective memory. Hitchcock allegedly produced the film in order to reclaim his designation as ""The Master of Suspense,"" as he considered Frenchman Henri-Georges Clouzot to have temporarily seized the title with 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and especially 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' Interestingly, the latter film has a particularly alarming bathtub sequence, and perhaps 'Psycho' was the film through which Hitchcock was able to respond to (and improve upon) the achievements of his chief rival. Gone are the larger-than-life artistic flourishes of 'Vertigo (1958)' and 'North by Northwest (1959)' ∂? this is the Master of Suspense at his leanest and meanest, a film completely stripped of its spectacle and lowered into the unfathomable depths of the disturbed human mind. Adapted by Joseph Stefano and Samuel A. Taylor from a 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' opens with the character of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real-estate secretary who impulsively steals $40,000 from her boss and flees in the direction of her California boyfriend. Her cross-country flight ultimately leads her to the Bates Motel, managed by the awkward and mild-mannered Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a man who submits loyally to the wishes of his mentally-ill, domineering mother. Meanwhile, Marion's boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and sister Lila (Vera Miles) set out in pursuit, their search ending ∂? inevitably ∂? at the Bates motel. The story sporadically shifts from one character to the other; after convincing audiences that Marion Crane is ""the wrong man"" of so many of his previous pictures, Hitchcock deftly strikes at the heart of their sympathies. In his early film 'Sabotage (1936),' the director had condemned his own decision to murder a character with whom the viewer had been asked to identify, though here he once again dared to break his own rules, and we've never forgotten it. Paramount was so aghast at the story's graphic subject matter, labelling it ""too repulsive,"" that Hitchcock's budget was severely restricted, and the director was forced to finance the film through his own Shamley Productions. These budget limitations proved crucial in developing the unforgettable atmosphere, and were a major factor in his decision to film is black-and-white (which he also did to avoid incurring the wrath of the censors). Though 'Psycho' received a mixed critical response upon its release, its commercial success was extraordinary, and film-goers lined entire city blocks to experience the director's latest. Conversely, fellow British director Michael Powell's thematically-similar 'Peeping Tom (1960)' had been severely trashed by critics and audiences alike just months earlier, and the career of the beloved filmmaker was, for all practical purposes, left in ruins. Furthermore, the success of 'Psycho' triggered the emergence of the ""slasher"" flick, and subsequent years saw a slew of inferior, gory and imaginatively-titled knock-offs, such as 'Maniac (1963),' 'Paranoic (1963)' and 'Fanatic (1965).' Though discussions of 'Psycho' rarely stray from the film's more disturbing moments, it's interesting to consider the various crucial scenes of human interaction. Marion's supper with Norman in the parlour room, surrounded by the seemingly-passive but strangely-threatening stuffed birds, is a masterpiece of nervous tension, awkwardness, and the tiny inflections of human speech that communicate more than mere words ever could. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman Bates to quirky perfection, and his character {perhaps modelled from Dennis Weaver's jittery hotel night manager in 'Touch of Evil (1958)' ∂? also starring Janet Leigh} is a man who initially demands our pity and understanding. Even after the atrocity in the shower, Hitchcock, as he also did in 'Frenzy (1972),' builds a suspense sequence around a villain's attempts to conceal the traces of his crime. Martin Balsam is rarely mentioned when discussing the film, but his characterisation of detective Milton Arbogast is letter-perfect, his shrewd but amenable tone successfully lulling Norman into a false sense of triumph, and yet the audience knows full well that the experienced investigator sees the transparency of his lies. Despite the prevalence of cultural spoofs and references, 'Psycho' is a thriller that still holds up exceptionally well, even though most viewers are fully-aware of the first major twist. When I first watched the film several years ago, I was completely ignorant of Mother's true identity, and I gasped aloud at the revelation in the fruit cellar, the swinging lightbulb casting a shifting luminance on the rotting corpse of Norma Bates, as Bernard Herrmann's intense, imaginative and very memorable musical score screeches in the background. Few moments in cinema have succeeded in giving me the same icy chill as the image of Norman in the prison cell, consumed by the mental consciousness of his overbearing mother, and that sinister smile that fades subliminally into the decaying shadow of a human skull. Norman Bates will continue to live on in my nightmares.  "
46842,tt0082971,ackstasis,australia,10,"Well, Jones, at least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time.","It seems utterly implausible that there exists anybody who doesn't love 'Raiders of the Lost Ark.' Undoubtedly one of the most riveting cinematic adventures every committed to screen, the film was released in 1981 to phenomenal critical and box-office success, and made the rugged, handsome, tenacious, whip-cracking treasure-hunter Indiana Jones a household name. The concept of the film was originally envisioned by producer George Lucas, hot off the release of 'Star Wars (1977),' who had wanted to homage and revive the cliffhanger adventure serials of the 1930s. He teamed up with rising director Steven Spielberg, who had also already hit it big with such successes as 'Jaws (1975)' and 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).' Together, equipped with a story by Lucas and Phillip Kaufman, and a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan, they embarked on the production of perhaps one of the most exciting films ever made. The story itself, which takes place in 1936, is deceptively simple. Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford, at the time most noted for playing Han Solo in 'Star Wars') is a respectable tweed-wearing archeology professor at an American college. However, when he is not teaching rather dull lectures in which he represents archeology as a non-exciting profession, Jones is traipsing across the globe in search of treasured ancient artifacts with the goal of historical preservation, donating his pieces to the museum of Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott). We can only watch in awe as, in one of the most breathtaking opening sequences of any film, Jones navigates the perilous Peruvian jungle in search of the golden Hovito Idol, facing such pitfalls as an immense rolling boulder, poison darts and masses of deadly tarantulas. However, after acquiring the idol, Jones is outsmarted by his immoral and greedy French rival, Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman), ultimately leaving Peru with nothing. After his return to America, Jones is approached by two Army Intelligence officers (Don Fellows and William Hootkins). The US military has intercepted a message from Cairo to Berlin, where the evil Fuhrer Adolf Hitler has ordered his men to uncover the legendary Ark of the Covenant, the sacred box reputed to contain the original stone tablets upon which are written the Ten Commandments. In his globe-trotting mission to discover the Ark before the evil Nazis can get their hands on it, Jones receives assistance from an old friend, Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) and an old flame, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen). Once again, Jones finds himself coming up against his old foe Belloq, whilst a Nazi colonel (Wolf Kahler) and their resident torturer (a truly sinister Ronald Lacey) only add to his troubles. In order for 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' to be such a success, everything needed to be done bigger and better than the audience had ever seen before. The film is essentially one lengthy action sequence after another, culminating in a terrifying, effects-driven climax when the Ark is finally opened. With the exception of this final scene (which was engineered by Lucas' company, Industrial Light & Magic, and is probably the only sequence that has begun to show its age), most of the film's daring moments were produced using old-school special effects and clever stunt-work. Interestingly, the brilliant, oft-cited truck chase sequence was actually filmed by the second-unit using Spielberg's extensive storyboards, with Harrison Ford's close-ups added later in production. There's no doubt that countless similar films had been released in the past, and Lucas and Spielberg drew a lot of their inspiration from other works. So what makes 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' so damn amazing? Probably more than anything, it is the wry sense of humour. The film never takes itself too seriously, and the cast certainly looks as though they are having a grand time, with Harrison Ford greeting each of his character's new and perilous challenges with a soft sigh and an adjustment of his trademark fedora hat. The scene in which Jones nonchalantly blasts a cocky swordsman with his Smith & Wesson is one of the most memorable of all time, making you want to stand up and cheer for your favourite hero (the idea itself was conceived by Ford on the day of shooting, when, suffering from dysentery, he decided that he had had enough of filming that fight scene). An uplifting score from long-time Spielberg collaborator John Williams also helps make the film so very memorable. Unlike your typical film hero, Indiana Jones is not an invincible superhuman, getting decidedly battered and bruised at every turn. At one point, his rival Belloq remarks that they are surprisingly alike, despite their antagonistic attitudes towards one another. This is quite accurate; both adventurers often use suspect means to acquire the treasures they seek, the main differences between them being the motivation: whilst Belloq is driven by greed, Jones is concerned with historical preservation of important artifacts. Likewise, Marion is not your typical damsel-in-distress, a proud, independent bar-owner who is (usually) able to take care of herself. At the 1982 Academy Awards, 'Raiders' was nominated for a total of eight Oscars (including Best Picture, though it lost to Hugh Hudson's 'Chariots of Fire'), and it left with four, including Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing and Best Sound. It also received a Special Achievement Award for its sound effects editing. 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' was followed by two extremely enjoyable sequels, 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984)' and 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)' (the latter being my very favourite of the series), and, just a few weeks ago (June 2007), filming for a fourth Indiana Jones adventure commenced.

48225,tt0120689,ackstasis,australia,10,"We each owe a death - there are no exceptions - but sometimes, oh God, the Green Mile seems so long","Every so often, a film comes along that somehow manages to worm its way into your heart, and then stays with you for years afterward. For this staunch atheist, that film inexplicably happened to be a Christ allegory, the poignant story of a miracle-man on death-row during the Great Depression. Director Frank Darabont, who impossibly followed up his debut 'The Shawshank Redemption (1994)' with something even better, is remarkable in his ability to evoke time and place, and to tell a story with a wistful nostalgia that incorporates the audience into its intimacy. Every character ∂? even the minor supporting players ∂? is perfectly drawn, as though we've known them our whole lives; now mere memories in the near-forgotten past. The 1935 setting emphasises the contrast between the general and widespread despair of the Depression, which had brought the entire developed world to its knees, with the arrival on death-row of John Coffey, an immense, mild-mannered African American with a special gift. Like Darabont's previous film, 'The Green Mile (1999)' was adapted from an excellent story by horror icon Stephen King, this one originally released as a collection of novellas. Former prison-guard Paul Edgecomb (Dabbs Greer) awakens from bad dreams to find himself in a nursing home that closely resembles the psychiatric ward in 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975).' Paul seeks solitude in the vast green hills surrounding the home, but the demons of his past inevitably return to haunt him, and he breaks down in tears at the sight of Fred and Ginger dancing cheek-to-cheek in 'Top Hat (1935).' Slowly and painfully, Paul recounts the events that changed his life in 1935, when a gentle Black giant named John Coffey (""like the drink, only not spelt the same"") arrived on the lime-coloured tiles of the Green Mile to pay his due to society, for the vile murder of two young girls. For Paul (now played by Tom Hanks), everything he thinks he knows about life and God suddenly takes an unexpected, miraculous and even frightening turn. It's one thing to have an ensemble of well-written characters, but the task of credibly communicating each personality ultimately comes down to the actors. Simply put, everybody in 'The Green Mile' ∂? both the seasoned veterans and the emerging talents ∂? delivers with a professionalism and sincerity rarely seen in today's big-budget pictures. Tom Hanks, as always, is strong in the lead role, possessing enough honest charm to make Edgecomb strong yet identifiable to the audience. Michael Clarke Duncan, in the role of his career, deservedly received an Oscar nomination for his role as John Coffey, a slow but earnest giant (probably inspired, in part, by John Steinbeck's Lennie Small) who, despite his sheer goodness, has become disillusioned by the corruption of our world. If Coffey is an allegory for Jesus Christ, then Sam Rockwell ∂? as ""Wild Bill"" Wharton ∂? is the film's representation of the Devil, a deranged youth whose only purpose in life is to wreak chaos on those around him. It's a telling sign that we frequently enjoy a chuckle at his mean-spirited (but admittedly creative) misdemeanours. I want to dedicate a paragraph to Doug Hutchison as Percy Whetmore, simply because his supporting performance is one of the most extraordinary I've ever seen, and certainly among the most underrated in recent memory. Hutchison, an unknown actor ∂? except to fans of 'The X-Files' ∂? goes beyond being a straightforward villain, absolutely relishing the detestable guise of an erratic young prison guard with connections in high places. Smug, slimy and impulsive, Percy is a dangerous man to have around death-row, all the more so because he's as stupid as he is influential. Unlike Wild Bill, with whom the audience forms some sort of morbid connection, Percy is loathsome in every sense of the word, the only character since Nurse Ratched that I've genuinely want to wring about the neck. In his excellence, Hutchison is joined by an impeccable supporting cast, which is worth mentioning in its entirety: David Morse, Barry Pepper, Jeffrey DeMunn, Michael Jeter, Graham Greene, James Cromwell, Gary Sinise, Bonnie Hunt, Patricia Clarkson and, always a treat, Harry Dean Stanton. King's original novel included a heartbreaking epilogue in which Paul watches his wife die in a road accident, as the immense black shadow of a recognisable man looms chillingly in the distance, an ominous reminder of Paul's sins. In the film, Darabont alludes only briefly to Jan's (Bonnie Hunt) death, but he strikes a similar note of melancholy as Paul reflects on the friends and family whom he has been forced to outlive as ""punishment"" for executing one of God's miracles. When Paul unaffectedly remarks to his audience, Elaine (Eve Brent), that she, too, will die in due course, the utter loneliness of his predicament truly hits home, and our fascination at his longevity is swiftly replaced with a gutting hollowness. Though Thomas Newman's score is suitably emotional, the most powerful moments are those accompanied by the nostalgic tunes of the era. The sheer blind optimism of ""Cheek to Cheek"" and ""Did You Ever See A Dream Walking?"" is heartbreaking when set against the hopelessness and despair of death-row and the Great Depression. Now I can't watch 'Top Hat' without getting a little teary.  "
48714,tt0027977,ackstasis,australia,9,Buck up - never say die. We'll get along,"By 1936, Charles Chaplin was already an anachronism ∂? albeit, an anachronism who was also treasured as an artistic genius. The arrival of 'The Jazz Singer (1927)' did little to curb the director's enthusiasm for silent cinema, and, though he considered at length the commercial implications of converting to synchronised sound, his first film in the ""talkie"" age was almost completely silent (Chaplin compromised by composing a musical score). Nevertheless, the critical and commercial response to 'City Lights (1931)' was strong, reaffirming Chaplin's status as a cinematic master, and vindicating his decision to linger with an otherwise extinct medium. Thus, 'Modern Times (1936)' was to follow in the same mould, despite a synchronised soundtrack which includes a musical score, sound effects and several lines of spoken dialogue (always spoken through a mechanical ""barrier,"" such as a record-player, radio or loudspeaker). The film is historically significant in that it was Chaplin's first overtly political work, raising concerns inspired both by the economic hardship of the Great Depression, and Chaplin's growing interest in socialism. The title 'Modern Times' is used to deliberate ironic effect. Traditionally, to be modern was to be at the forefront of human progress, a step forwards in Man's noble attempt to assert his dominance over his environment; in short, to further distinguish our species from the lower animals. Yet Chaplin believed that such widespread industrialisation was a step backwards for society. Even from the opening shot, he draws comparisons between the hustling crowds of factory workers travelling to work, and a flock of sheep being herded through a corral. The dehumanisation caused by the workers' monotonous factory work is played for maximum comedic effect, with Chaplin's Tramp eventually driven to a nervous breakdown by Frederick Taylor's apathetic brand of scientific management. In these conditions, direct human interaction is minimal, and almost always channelled through an mechanical mediator. In a scene predating Orwell's ""Nineteen-Eighty Four (1949),"" Chaplin is reprimanded by a telescreen in the bathroom, the image of his boss looming overhead like the spectre of Big Brother. Chaplin may also have been remarking upon the rise of the Hollywood studio system, which by then employed a comparable assembly-line approach to film-making. Chaplin, who was given full artistic control through his co-ownership of United Artists, worked in complete opposition to these practices, though it could be argued that his perfectionism and often improvisational style was so inefficient that only an artist as wealthy as he could have gotten away with it. Truth be told, there's nothing particularly distinguished about Chaplin's direction ∂? despite his strong reliance upon actions over words, his silent films were never as visually accomplished as that of Murnau or Lang, for example. However, his greatest talents as a filmmaker were concerned with the plight of people, and, however much sentimentality he liked to dish out, there can be no doubt that, in Chaplin's characters, one found individuals with whom they shared a very real human bond, of empathy and compassion. For all the director's criticism of modern society, he possessed a genuine belief in the value of human spirit. When Chaplin came under fire for alleged ""communist sympathies"" in the late 1940s, the content of 'Modern Times' was scrutinised for evidence to support the allegations. Certainly, within the director's distaste for industrialisation one may discern an underlying dissatisfaction with capitalism, but Chaplin was definitely not a communist; after all, a prime motivation in his choosing to continue producing silent films was to retain his commercial popularity in foreign-language markets ∂? that's the capitalist spirit! Nevertheless, Chaplin was eerily prescient when he included a scene in which his Tramp is falsely accused of being a communist, mirroring his own intense political troubles, which concluded in 1952 with the retraction of his US re-entry visa. Though he was initially hesitant about breaking his screen silence, as Chaplin's political convictions grew, so too did his desire to have himself heard. For that, he would, however reluctantly, have to embrace the technology of sound, and, for a mouthpiece, he would choose the most hated man in Europe.  "
48869,tt0047396,ackstasis,australia,9,A murderer would never parade his crime in front of an open window,"There can be absolutely no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most gifted film directors ever to work in Hollywood, and 'Rear Window' is one film that demonstrates most exhaustively his enormous talents. I must admit that, on my first viewing of the film, I was quite new to his work, and, whilst I thought it was a solid achievement, it didn't strike me as being anything particularly special. How wrong I was! With subsequent viewings of 'Rear Window,' include one in a cinema, I was able to better appreciate its intricacies: the flawless performances, the 100 minutes of subtle, wonderfully-executed suspense, the shades of delightfully-dark humour, the manner in which Hitchcock places the viewer inside Jeff's tiny apartment. Released in 1954, 'Rear Window' was the second of four Hitchcock films to star James Stewart (the others being 'Rope,' 'Vertigo' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'), and the second of three to feature one of Hollywood's greatest beauties, Grace Kelly ('Dial M for Murder,' 'To Catch a Thief'). On the surface, the plot to 'Rear Window' is deceptively straightforward. The screenplay was written by four-time Hitchcock collaborator John Michael Hayes, and based loosely on the short story 'It Had to be Murder,' by Cornell Woolrich. Confined to his apartment with a broken leg, successful adventure photographer L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (Stewart) passes the tedious days and weeks by peering through the window at his neighbours, watching and learning their daily activities and rituals. When he is not being a voyeur, Jeff is distracted by visits from an embittered insurance company nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and his beautiful, glamorous socialite girlfriend, Lisa (Kelly). Jeff's ""peeping tom"" activities become considerably more serious than simply a means of passing the time, and he is soon immersed in the triumphs and failures of his neighbours. On one particular night, Jeff notices a man in the apartment across the courtyard (Raymond Burr) acting in a suspicious manner, and, despite the doubt of his friends, he begins to suspect that this man has committed an absolutely heinous crime. The sheer genius of 'Rear Window' is not just how well-executed this storyline is, but how Hitchcock ties it together with numerous other narratives, making all of the strings equally-interesting to watch. Each of the apartments visible from Jeff's window acts like a different world ∂? a separate movie ∂? and the combination of all of these creates a rich tapestry of lifestyles, and a range of human relationships that mirror that of Jeff and Lisa. For example, there is hard-working salesmen Lars Thorwald, who arrives home each day to the incessant nagging of his invalid wife (Irene Winston); the woman in the floor below, dubbed ""Miss Lonelyheart"" (Judith Evelyn), is a hopeless romantic who, in her depression, is addicted to alcohol and sleeping pills; a young music writer (Ross Bagdasarian) struggles to make an income; a sexy young dancer, ""Miss Torso"" (Georgine Darcy), practises her dance moves and battles various suitors; two newly-weds frequently culminate their marriage with the blinds drawn, though, by the end of the film, the wife has begun the nagging that is arguably characteristic of the gender! Despite obviously being in love with Lisa, Jeff is apprehensive of approaching marriage, fearing that his gritty, adventurous, globe-trotting lifestyle will not be compatible with Lisa's love of socialising and high-fashion (she is never caught wearing the same expensive dress twice). At first, we notice Jeff using the lives of those in the other apartments to distract from the troubles in his own, and he often uses the examples before him to support the decisions that he must make in his own life. As the film progresses, Lisa reveals a daring, audacious streak in trying to solve the mystery, and Jeff realises that, when love is concerned, small compromises can and should be made in order to make a fateful relationship work. As the film closes, we notice Lisa lying on a bed in common, unglamorous clothing, reading the book, ""Beyond the High Himalayas,"" no doubt in preparation for the couple's next adventure. However, though some compromises have been made, Lisa still remains her own women, suddenly casting aside Jeff's reading material and raising her own ""Harper's Bazaar"" magazine to her face. Of course, despite the multitude of little narratives that comprise the film, the most significant ∂? and, indeed, the one we remember best ∂? is that of Lars Thorwald and his missing wife, Anna. After witnessing the former acting suspiciously during a stormy night, Jeff suspects that the over-worked and under-appreciated Thorwald has brutally murdered his wife, decapitated her body into several pieces and carried out the remains in a suitcase. Though Jeff's police detective ex-War buddy, Thomas J, Doyle (Wendell Corey), believes Jeff's story to be fantastic, Stella and Lisa soon come to accept the theory as fact, helping an immobile Jeff to solve the mystery. That we never fully understand the motivations of the murderer, having to be content with brief glimpses from afar, is crucial to Hitchcock's storytelling, and, by making the audience complicit in his characters' voyeurism, we feel as though our safety is being placed in jeopardy. The entire film possesses a very subtle air of unrelenting suspense, but the final ten minutes or so are among the most thrilling in cinema history.  "
49348,tt0103064,ackstasis,australia,10,"The Terminator wouldn't stop, it would never leave him","Watching 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day (1991)' for the first time in three years made me remember how amazing movies could be. Director James Cameron had previously achieved unexpected success with 'The Terminator (1984),' a moody and relentlessly bleak tech-noir thriller. The inevitable sequel came armed with a blockbuster budget and state-of-the- arts visual effects, and it is a triumph on every level. The two films are very different, of course ∂? just as Cameron's 'Aliens (1986)' was very different from Ridley Scott's 'Alien (1979).' The first Terminator film was a down-and-dirty dystopian sci-fi, where the modern-day setting is just as drab and ominous as the terrifying future. In 'Judgement Day,' Cameron juggles a tricky juxtaposition of hope and despair. The blindingly-vivid 1990s action sequences feel as though they were captured in the flash of a nuclear explosion, and their dazzling intensity make our glimpse of a bleak, war-ridden future all the more horrific. Science-fiction has often tackled the notion that Mankind's technology is destined to rebel, as in '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).' However, unlike most entries to the genre, 'T2: Judgement Day' takes the time to explore the idea. As in Kubrick's film, the fates of humans and machines become inescapably entwined: Man is no longer merely the designer (a la Dr. Frankenstein) who creates an artificial son, but one who must learn from his progeny. Accordingly, John Connor (Edward Furlong) and the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) share a father-son relationship that twists back on itself like a Moebius strip, each half teaching the other. In one haunting sequence, Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton) grimly contemplates the Terminator's unwavering loyalty towards John, and his ironic suitability as a father figure. This grotesque interlacing of familial roles speaks a clear message: if Judgement Day is to be averted, Man and Machine must coexist as equals, though human vanity may never allow it. Throughout the film, Cameron weaves one astonishing action set-piece after another, utilising a seamless combination CGI and optical trickery. The T-1000 Terminator at first glance seems reasonably innocuous, but Robert Patrick brings something icily sinister to the role, a cold intelligence that isn't strictly mechanical but somehow filled with imagination. An equally fascinating character, I thought, was Linda Hamilton's Sarah Connor, a complete reversal from the innocent Sarah Connor of the previous film. Now emotionally hardened by the prospect of nuclear holocaust, Sarah sees only ghosts where she once saw people, her apathy stemmed only by her maternal instincts towards John. In a haunting dream sequence, Sarah Connor is powerless to warn a younger version of herself (representative of society at large) of the coming dangers, her screams consumed by a nuclear blast that levels cities and engulfs her in flames. Hamilton's performance is bold and ferocious, perhaps cinema's most intense female action role (not coincidentally, James Cameron also provided us with the runner-up, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in 'Aliens (1986)).'  "
57245,tt0078788,ackstasis,australia,10,Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror,"Unlike the bulk of war films, 'Apocalypse Now (1979)' is not really about war, or, at least, it is only superficially so. The more significant conclusion to be drawn from Francis Ford Coppola's ambitious masterpiece is how the horror of war reveals the ultimate truths of our existence; how it exposes and illuminates the darkened shadows of the human psyche. The screenplay was adapted, very loosely, from Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness (1899)"" ∂? a novel not without its interest, but one that I found rather tiresome reading. Coppola transplants the story from the Congo jungle to the murky depths of the Vietnam War, which in 1979 still left a bitter taste in the mouths of American audiences. The allegory of a man, on the brink of madness, choosing again and again to pursue his own evil upriver is equally relevant in any setting ∂? Nicholas Roeg's 'Heart of Darkness (1994)' was, from what I gather, a more traditional retelling of Conrad's tale, while Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre, The Wrath of God (1972)' uncovered the darker side of Man in the desolate heart of 16th century Peru. ""We had access to too much money∂? too much equipment. And, little by little, we went insane."" Fresh from the phenomenal success of 'The Godfather (1972),' its sequel and 'The Conversation (1974),' Francis Ford Coppola was among the most respected filmmakers of his era. For his long-awaited next project, he decided upon 'Apocalypse Now,' then oblivious to the extent to which the film would crush his spirit. As grippingly documented in the unmissable making-of documentary 'Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse (1991),' the film's production parallels that of the story it depicts ∂? an intrepid director embarks on an impossible mission, its conclusion unknown, choosing against his better judgement to continue filming at any cost, risking insanity and financial ruin. A modest on-location shooting period soon ballooned into nearly 16 months; typhoons destroyed expensive sets; leading man Martin Sheen suffered a heart attack and battled alcoholism; the Philippine military frequently whisked away their helicopters to be used in active combat against rebel insurgents. It was Hell broken loose ∂? for Coppola, the apocalypse had arrived. The film's screenplay, by Coppola and John Milius (with Willard's memorable voice-over penned by Michael Herr), still retains many of the themes of Conrad's original novella, with Kurtz's distaste for British Colonialism replaced with his disgust at the needless hypocrisy of the United States' interventionism. Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) certainly isn't a typical war hero: even at the film's beginning, he sits at the verge of breakdown. As he lounges in a sweaty Saigon motel room, Willard contemplates the seductive stench of a napalm strike, equates the beating of the ceiling fan with the muffled whirr of a military chopper; he craves the horrors of the jungle combat, and he's not alone. Many lesser war films are content to settle on the age-old clich«∏ that ""war is hell,"" before hypocritically celebrating the overblown heroism of its brave soldiers. Coppola here does no such thing. In Vietnam, soldiers are mere pawns in this absurd, sadistic mockery of life and common sense; and war creates no heroes, but turns us all into monsters. Note the progressive dwindling of humanity as Willard works his way upriver. At the river's mouth, the laid-back Lt. Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) casually goes about his duties, launching an explosive aerial assault on a Vietnamese village (to the bombastic notes of Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkyries"") purely because of the beach's ideal surfing conditions. This nonchalant fool retains enough compassion to bring water to a dying enemy soldier, but discards the canteen as soon as he notices the arrival of a famous American surfer. We progress upstream: a love-sick mob of recruits overrun a USO show, a boatload of Vietnamese civilians are gunned down in a moment of panic, a final American outpost operates frantically without any form of command. By the time they reach Colonel Kurtz's (Marlon Brando) outpost in Cambodia, where natives have idolised him as a demi-god, Captain Willard and his remaining crew have shed every last sliver of humour, purpose and humanity. They progress, as in a drug-induced haze, towards the now-inescapable mouth of madness. Watching 'Apocalypse Now' ∂? particularly in the cinema, as I recently did ∂? was an extraordinarily invigorating experience, and I left the theatre with a cold chill down my spine. As a work of film-making, it is, to quote Colonel Kurtz, ""perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure."" Vittorio Storaro's on-location cinematography is completely breathtaking in its scope and immediacy, shifting gradually from the open-air theatrics of Kilgore's morning aerial assault to the closed, claustrophobic shadows of Kurtz's compound. At the long-awaited premiere, Coppola described his film, perhaps a tad pretentiously, as ""not about Vietnam, it is Vietnam; it's what it was really like."" I'm inclined to agree. With respect to Steven Spielberg's accomplishments in 'Saving Private Ryan (1998),' I'd imagine that the human experience of war is not one of terrifying realism and clarity, but of a dream, the sensation of stumbling through a surreal carnival house of horrors. In the film's final moments, as that shadow of a helicopter flitters across the screen, we know that, wherever he goes from here, Willard will never truly leave the jungle.  "
58098,tt0482571,ackstasis,australia,8,Are you watching closely?,"A good suspense film is very much like a magician's trick: we have absolutely no idea where this remarkable lead-up is taking us, and the final revelation is so mind-blowing that, after the curtains come down, we find ourselves stumbling from the theatre in a delightful daze of exhilaration and satisfaction. Already, we are arguing with the person who was sitting beside us: how was it all accomplished? One by one, most of the pieces slowly fall into place, but the film/magician still retain a sense of mystery, of wonder, of magic. Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is precisely this sort of film. In the grand scheme of things, it is something of a nonentity, destined to become neither significant nor influential; however, it is such a invigorating thrill-ride that you get the sense that it is the promise of films like this that is the very reason we go to the cinema. Having already established his reputation as the director of 'Memento' and 'Batman Begins,' Christopher Nolan here cements his place as one of Hollywood's most exciting talents. 'The Prestige,' a riveting tale of magician rivalry, is set in England at the turn of the 20th century (much like its contemporary, Neil Burger's excellent 'The Illusionist') and stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in top-form. It was adapted from Christopher Priest's successful 1995 novel of the same name, with the screenplay penned by the director and his brother Jonathon Nolan, who, once again, employ the use of their favoured non-linear narrative structure. The title refers to the third of three fictional components of a typical magic trick, as outlined in Priest's story: The Pledge (""The magician shows you something ordinary""), The Turn (""The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary"") and, finally, The Prestige (""making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige.""). Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, an ambitious budding magician who is willing to sacrifice everything to become the greatest of all time. Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier, a born showman, who tragically lost is wife (Piper Perabo) during a failed underwater predicament escape, an accident for which he blames Borden. As the two magicians part ways for separate careers, Angier bitterly despises that Borden has formed a family and found happiness, and their professional and personal rivalry only intensifies when Borden pulls off ""the greatest magic trick∂? ever seen,"" known as The Transported Man. Desperate to upstage his competitor, Angier travels across the world to try and duplicate Borden's trick, his search leading him to the remote American laboratory of physicist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), whose work with Alternating Current electricity has spawned an invention of staggering capabilities. Aside from the passionate performances of its two leads, 'The Prestige' is also held together by numerous supporting roles of varying quality. Michael Caine is excellent as Cutter, the aging mentor whose experience and wisdom helps Angier on numerous occasions, though Angier's decision to neglect his old friend's confidence ultimately leads to his own downfall. Scarlett Johansson is competent as Olivia Wenscombe, the stage assistant who becomes the love interest of both rivals at some point during the film. The role was hardly a demanding one, basically requiring the actress to be on screen and to look glamorous; but, all things considered, she does this very well. David Bowie, rather strangely, has a riveting on screen presence as the real-life inventor Nikola Tesla, and Andy Serkis is enjoyable to watch as Tesla's assistant, Alley. Additionally, Rebecca Hall is pretty good as Borden's wife, Sarah, who is driven into depression by her husband's alternating personality and fierce dedication towards his work. The competition between the two magicians is absolutely thrilling to watch, as each continues to sabotage the other's work, in a grim and futile attempt to gain the upper hand. Obsession is one of the film's dominant themes, with Angier eventually becoming so dangerously infatuated with Borden's magic trick that he loses everything and everyone he cares about. Borden, meanwhile, also loses much that he loves, a sacrifice he is seemingly more-than-willing to make, though he is eventually given the opportunity to redeem himself. Mirroring this bitter antagonism is the rivalry between Tesla and (an unseen) Thomas Edison, with the latter ∂? an advocate of DC electricity ∂? taking numerous drastic steps to destroy the AC electricity experiments of his contemporary. Though largely grounded firmly in reality, 'The Prestige' takes a science-fiction turn in its climax, which may prove something of a cop-out for some, but will delight those who are enthusiastic about the genre. 'The Prestige' is a film with numerous twists to always keep you thinking, and, like a good magic trick, you'll be talking about it for hours after the show is over. Having watched the film a second time, I was pleased to find that the story (which has been described by some to be merely ""gimmicky"") holds up well on multiple viewing. Another interesting thing to note is that the hints towards the final twist are certainly there in full-view for you to notice∂? the only thing is, you won't notice them. Why? Because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled.  "
59809,tt0078748,ackstasis,australia,9,Its structural perfection is matched only by its hostility,"I was recently fortunate enough to experience 'Alien (1979)' at the cinema, and now it's become one of my favourite science-fiction films. That Ridley Scott was partly influenced by Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' is a given. When the Nostromo crew members are exploring the unknown planet in their spacesuits, Scott frames the action so that their space helmets claustrophobically crowd his hand-held camera; in this way, as in the Moon-walk in '2001,' the audience imagines themselves walking alongside these figures. It's this evocation of setting that most impressed me about 'Alien.' Despite a relatively modest budget compared to its sequels, the film does an incredible job of genuinely placing the viewer inside its manufactured reality. For this reason, I may be in the minority in declaring my greatest admiration for Scott's opening act, in which the titular Alien scarcely makes an appearance. Though the excessive parade of sequels and spin-offs has potentially dampened its impact, the Alien body design by H.R. Giger remains unforgettable. The organism's arachnid-like appendages and movements are given life ∂? and even an astonishing sort of beauty ∂? by the tall, slender frame of Nigerian-born Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the Alien in most scenes. Additionally, what separates 'Alien' from most inferior ""monster movies"" is a legitimate affection for its own monster. In one scene, the Nostromo's science officer Ash (Ian Holm) confesses an admiration for the creature's evolutionary purity, an instinct for survival ""unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality."" From this perspective, it's very difficult to hate the Alien. Indeed, in the film's climax, when Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) blasts the organism into open space, I even felt an unmistakable pang of regret.  "
60753,tt0043014,ackstasis,australia,9,I am big. It's the pictures that got small.,"Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Boulevard' is a film about Hollywood. It is not concerned with the happy, idealised version of Hollywood that we would usually expect, but rather it offers a darker, more cynical outlook on the subject, a potent mixture of drama, romance and black comedy. Joe Gillis (William Holden) is a failed hack screenwriter whose car is about to be repossessed. When he stumbles upon a broken-down mansion, he comes to meet silent screen star Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), whose career floundered with the arrival of talkies, but who still maintains delusions of her own fame and grandeur. When Norma offers Joe money to edit the script for her big comeback, he simply can't resist the opportunity, completely oblivious to the fact that, by the time the events of the film are over, he will be dead. Very curiously, the film is shown in flashback form, narrated by Joe Gillis from beyond the grave. We first come across him floating lifelessly in Norma Desmond's pool, surrounded by detectives and photographers. The original edit of the film opened in a morgue, with the assembled corpses ∂? Joe included ∂? discussing how they came to be here. However, audiences considered the scene so ludicrous that they were unsure whether to approach the rest of the film as a drama or a comedy. After the removal of this opening scene, audiences reacted more favourably, and Joe Gillis' post-death voice-over adds a darkly humorous touch to the film, also successfully evoking the feel of a classic film-noir, of which Billy Wilder was a veteran (see 'Double Indemnity (1944)' for an archetypal classic of the genre). 'Sunset Boulevard' really is a surprisingly contemptuous anti-tribute to Hollywood. Aside from casting Gloria Swanson as the long-forgotten silent star (who, herself, had struggled to adapt to the introduction of sound films), Wilder also makes somewhat sadistic use of Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilsson and H.B. Warner. In a brief cameo appearance (credited as themselves), and described by Joe as ""waxworks,"" the three silent stars play similarly ""has-been"" actors who attend a bridge game at Norma's mansion. Furthermore, Erich von Stroheim ∂? who plays Norma's sinister servant, former-director and first husband, Max ∂? is forced to sit through a screening of 'Queen Kelly,' a disastrous unfinished 1929 film in which he directed a younger Gloria Swanson. Re-enforcing the theme that a certain level of corruption has seeped into new Hollywood, many of the characters are portrayed as being deceitful or manipulative. In a futile bid for self-validation and intimacy, Norma manipulates Joe into staying at her mansion, even threatening suicide on numerous occasions to prevent him from leaving her. Joe, on the other hand, exploits Norma's misguided delusions of success to provide him with financial security. Nonetheless, it is to Wilder's credit that he makes both of these characters appear somewhat sympathetic to the audience. By the end of the film, Joe partly compensates for his devious past behaviour, coming clean with Norma and convincing young budding writer, Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olson), that she would be happier with her fianc«∏ (Jack Webb) than with him. However, in typical Wilder fashion, having finally learned an important lesson about life, Joe is promptly rewarded with his own murder. By showing the decline of many of old Hollywood's finest stars, Wilder hints at the corruptive, devastating influences of new Hollywood, and of the modern studio system. This view was not accepted kindly by some in the industry; producer Louis B. Mayer famously confronted the director in public, declaring that ""you have disgraced the industry that made and fed you. You should be tarred and feathered and run out of Hollywood."" Fortunately, most in Hollywood disagreed, and 'Sunset Boulevard' was honoured with eleven Academy Award nominations, including three wins (Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music and Best Writing). Paradoxically, whilst the film explores the tragic degradation of Hollywood at the turn of the 1950s, this Billy Wilder masterpiece proves beyond doubt that, in that era, Hollywood film-making was in a golden age.

61521,tt0095765,ackstasis,australia,8,Life isn't like in the movies. Life is much harder.,"Filmmakers often possess a deeper passion that is noticeably reflected in their work. However, there is one passion that all directors inevitably share, and that is for cinema itself. Films like Woody Allen's 'The Purple Rose of Cairo (1985)' and, more recently, Michel Gondry's 'Be Kind Rewind (2008),' exhibit such affection towards movies and movie-making that no film-lover can help but like them. In 1988, Italian director Giuseppe Tornatore released 'Nuovo cinema Paradiso / Cinema Paradiso,' his personal ode to the magic of movies and the humble small-town cinema. After a poor local performance, the film was sheered down to 123 minutes (from 155 minutes), and subsequently went on to win both the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival and the Best Foreign-Language Film Oscar. In 2002, a 170-minute director's cut {marketed in the United States as 'Cinema Paradiso: The New Version'}, which restored all of the original future, was released into theatres. As the director's cut was the only version to which I had ready access, this was the one that I watched for the first time. The director's cut is notable in that it greatly expands on Alfred's role in Toto's life and career. In the hustle-and-bustle of modern Rome, acclaimed film director Salvatore ""Toto"" Di Vita (Jacques Perrin) returns home to a sad message from his elderly mother: ""Alfredo has died."" During the night, the man reflects on his childhood, when, as a bright and fervent young boy (played by Salvatore Cascio), he used to frequent his small town's local cinema, where the friendly projectionist, Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) taught him, however reluctantly, the tricks of the trade. Flash forward several years, and Toto is now a mature and intelligent teenager, falling for the first (and only) time into the throes of young love. Though I have not seen the shortened theatrical version, from what I've been able to gather, the story doesn't delve too deeply into the adventures of the adult Toto. In the director's cut, most of the additional running time is dedicated to his home-town return, as he is drawn almost overwhelmingly into the regretful ghosts of his past. These sequences are, of course, not without interest, but Tornatore is at his strongest in the first act, with Toto as an impressionable young boy immersed in the joy of cinema. Philippe Noiret is wonderful as the warm and occasionally brusque film projectionist, and his interactions with Toto (especially young Salvatore Cascio) develop into a powerful father-son relationship. The director's cut intriguingly suggests that Alfred deliberately mislead Toto about Elena (Agnese Nano, later Brigitte Fossey) in order to preserve his chances of succeeding with his #1 love of all, movies. Alfred suspected that, had Toto married Elena, he would never have been able to become an accomplished film director ∂? as a beloved father figure for the boy, he made the difficult decision that Toto could never have made. The ethical complications of Alfred's decision are problematic, but one can at least follow his logic, and his motives, however misguided, were certainly well-intended. At the film's end, as the adult Toto is doubting his love for cinema, his passion is reassured with a wonderful montage of the romantic moments that the town's prudish priest had once sliced from every film to be screened in his theatre. This is the magic of cinema. It's not just the films themselves, but also the flood of personal memories that accompanies each forbidden screen embrace.  "

Rather than simply showing us the horrors of warfare and declaring that 'war is hell,' this films genuinely fills us with unbridled hate and anger, revealing the sheer folly and uselessness of combat. There are heroes in war, of course ∂? namely Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) and his brave fighting soldiers ∂? but certainly not the generals, who sit back in their comfortable armchairs and send thousands of their men to certain death without a trace of guilt or remorse. In the treacherous front-line trenches of World War One, a regiment of soldiers is ordered on a suicidal mission to seize the German-occupied ""Anthill."" French General Mireau (George Macready) is at first hesitant about the attack, citing the unacceptably high fatality rate and his duty to his loyal soldiers, but he is very quickly swayed in his convictions when his superior, General George Broulard, (Adolphe Menjou), hints at the possibility of a promotion. And so, led by a doubtful but loyal Colonel Dax (Douglas), the soldiers ∂? in perhaps the most realistic war combat scene this side of 'Saving Private Ryan' ∂? proceed with the attack, suffering immense losses and ultimately being forced to retreat. Furious about the perceived ""cowardice"" of his troops, an enraged General Mireau orders his artillery to open fire on his own men, but the artillery commander refuses to obey without a confirmation of written orders. Rather than taking the blame himself for the failed attack, Mireau decides to execute three men to set an example to the soldiers. Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker) is chosen for execution because his commanding officer has a personal vendetta against him; Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), one of the most courageous soldiers in his regiment, was chosen randomly; Private Ferol (Timothy Carey) was chosen because he was something of a social outcast. Colonel Lax passionately defends the actions of his men during the court-martial, but, despite the utterly ridiculous cases made against them, all three men are inevitably found guilty of ""cowardice in the face of the enemy"" and sentenced to death by firing squad. Later, in one of the most suspenseful sequences ever committed to film, accompanied by the slow steady beat of an army drum, the three condemned men are lead to their place of execution, tied to posts and shot down by the weapons of their own army. Any other film from this era would have baulked at the final moment, offering its prisoners a last-minute reprieve, and the swift persecution of every general in charge of the original attack. Kubrick reportedly toyed with this option at one point, but it is to his credit that he stood firm on his daring and controversial ending. Indeed, French authorities considered the film such an offence to their army's honour that it was banned until 1975.  "
63181,tt0081505,ackstasis,australia,9,"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in","As do most, I can clearly remember the first time I saw 'The Shining (1980).' I must have been thirteen or fourteen, and had just read Stephen King's novel. There was something cold and clinical about the film that really shook my spine; I could never quite put my finger on exactly why. Perhaps it was the drab colours, the detached camera-work, an overwhelming sense of apathy towards the characters' fate. Just recently, I took the opportunity to see 'The Shining' at the cinema (on a double-bill with 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)') and my appreciation for the film hasn't faded. An unhappily-married couple (Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall) are employed to caretake the Overlook Hotel over winter. As the long, bleak months progress, the Hotel's rich and dark history begins to manifest physically, and Jack's alcoholism and unstable psychological state begins to crumble into maniacal madness. Jack Nicholson's grotesquely over-the-top performance is terrifying, and hilarious, and insanely watchable; Kubrick encouraged Nicholson to overplay the role to its demented maximum. Not surprisingly, his favourite actor was James Cagney, who frequently eschewed realistic method acting in favour of a broiling intensity that suggested a time- bomb on the verge of exploding. Shelley Duvall, meanwhile, does a very good imitation of a complete mental breakdown (in fact, the director himself drove her to the brink with his endless insistence on re-takes, sometimes as many as 100). The exaggerated central performances are strangely at odds with John Alcott's detached cinematography, which surveys the carnage of Jack's mental breakdown with a disquieting aloofness. However, the camera doesn't merely act as an observer; Kubrick uses it to tell the story, his peculiar use of quick zooms serving to claustrophobically constrict the viewer's field of vision and emphasise an element of interest. Throughout the film, frequent (but irregularly-spaced) title cards signal the passage of time, as though counting down to a historical moment. Jack's plummet into insanity thus becomes set in stone, inevitable, and every preceding frame is plagued by the hand of Fate, gently nudging the man towards a predetermined end. In the film's ambiguous epilogue, Jack's image appears in a photograph dated July 4, 1921. Hence, even before we see Jack Torrance first enter the Overlook Hotel, he has already become a part of its history (just as the previous caretaker Charles Grady had formerly known the Hotel through his historical doppelganger Delbert Grady, the butler). Alternatively, these visions could be a manifestation of Jack's alcoholism ∂? note that, in every scene featuring a ghost, there is a mirror present. It can't be mere coincidence that Jack's axe-assault on a bathroom door was clearly inspired by a sequence in Victor Sj«Ùstr«Ùm's 'K«Ùrkarlen (1921),' which concerns an alcoholic husband and father.

Alone on a near-lifeless Earth centuries after the evacuation of the human race, a lone garbage robot, the last of his kind, obediently continues to carry out his duties, compacting rubbish into solid cubes and piling them into lofty buildings. The sky is brown and dusty, smothered by the detritus of Mankind's wastefulness, and the garbage cities are often bombarded by stinging dirt storms that ravage the filthy landscape. But, thanks to WALL∂?E (an acronym for ""Waste Allocation Load Lifter ∂? Earth-class""), there is still life to be found on our planet's barren remains. As he goes about his day, our delightful little hero picks up any odd item that happens to catch his eye ∂? a Rubik's cube, a plastic ""spork"", a light bulb, and, dearest to his heart, a battered VHS tape of Gene Kelly's 'Hello, Dolly! (1969),' which inspires the romantic in him. One day, WALL∂?E befriends a lonesome and resilient cockroach, and the pair carry on with their job each day, even discovering a single, tiny plant growing in sterile soil. Then, one day, love comes erupting into this little robot's life. A slick, white (and female!) robotic probe named EVE (""Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator"") arrives on the planet in search of photosynthesising organisms, blasting any perceived threats with her trigger-happy plasma cannon. Needless to say, WALL∂?E, however rusty his exterior, falls immediately in love with this beautiful feminine visitor, and what ensues is a genuinely-touching love story that serves as a charming amalgamation of Chaplin's 'City Lights (1931)' and Trumbull's 'Silent Running (1972).' Best of all, and very daringly for a children's film, this entire opening act unfolds with minimal dialogue, the two robots restricted to shrill buzzes and brief electronically-articulated utterances. Thus, their communication is almost exclusively through body language, and more meaning and emotion is recognised behind WALL∂?E's deep, sincere eyes than is to be discerned from most real-life actors. Had Pixar sustained this level of brilliance for the remainder of the picture, I would have had little reservations in declaring 'WALL∂?E' a masterpiece. However, for its final acts, the film descends slightly from the stratosphere of excellence, and eventually begins to acknowledge its human participants. After WALL∂?E hitches a ride on a departing spaceship, he ends up at a distant space station named ""Axiom,"" where the surviving human civilisation, now hopelessly obese beyond belief, idles away their lives before computer screens, allowing machines to cater for their every need. This commentary on our increasing over-reliance on technology (and technology's inevitable revolt) has been done to death in science-fiction, comprising everything from '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)' to 'Alien (1979)' to 'I, Robot (2004).' In contrast to the deep, earthy colours of the earlier segment, here the colour palette is bright, vivid and almost migraine-inducing, the visual equivalent to being injected with an overdose with caffeine. These sequences work to a degree, but the human characters are ill-defined, and so all we really care about is WALL∂?E. This being Pixar, of course, the film contains countless minute details that will thrill parents who are observant enough to catch them. There's the mutinous HAL-like ship computer, that nostalgic Mac start-up chime whenever WALL∂?E recharges, the adorable cleaning robot who feverishly scoots around the ship chasing foreign contaminants, the obligatory inclusion of both ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" and ""The Blue Danube""; I was also amused to notice a brief snippet of D.W. Griffith's 'A Corner in Wheat (1909)' when the ship captain (Jeff Garlin) requests a definition for ""earth"" {this, I suppose, is how you distinguish the true film buffs from the fakers!}. Younger audiences will probably find the film's second half ∂? with its zany colours, funny characters and chase sequences ∂? to be more appetising, but perhaps the more mature among us will lament the passing of that lovely, wholesome innocence in WALL∂?E and EVE's silent courtship, a style of art practically lost in time since the Little Tramp told his girl, ""Buck up - never say die. We'll get along.""  "
71655,tt0087843,ackstasis,australia,9,I like the stink of the streets. It cleans out my lungs.,"The director's final film, Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon a Time in America' is a spectacular sprawling epic of the lives of a group of Jewish Prohibition-era gangsters, witnessed through the memory of one member, Noodles (Robert De Niro), many decades afterward. Grand in both conception and execution, the film brilliantly combines flawless acting, a poetic script, stunning cinematography and a memorable musical score from long-time Leone-collaborator, Ennio Morricone. Despite weighing in at a hefty 229 minutes (Leone had originally envisioned a 6-hour epic), the film never fails to hold the audience's interest, flashing backwards and forwards between three eras in Noodle's life in an almost dream-like fashion, offering a compelling and comprehensive glimpse into his years as a gangster. If you're planning on watching this film, it is absolutely imperative ∂? at least for your first viewing ∂? that you track down the 4-hour version, which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival in 1984 and was seen throughout most of Europe. For its American release, the film was infamously massacred into a heavily-cut, fully-chronological 139-minute version, which became a marked critical and commercial flop and failed to garner a single Oscar nomination. Fortunately, the European version has gained greater prominence over the years, and is now quite easily obtained on DVD. The film is mostly inspired by an autobiographical novel, 'The Hoods,' written by a gangster-turned-informant under the pseudonym Harry Grey. Leone has wanted to adapt the novel since the 1960s, but had long been unable to secure the rights. Interweaving three chapters of the characters' lives ∂? 1921, 1933 and 1968 ∂? the film focuses primarily on two main characters: the quiet, reflective David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (played by Scott Tiler as a child, and Robert De Niro as an adult) and the very ambitious, quick-tempered Max Bercovicz (Rusty Jacobs as a child, James Woods as an adult). Also significant are the other younger members of the gang: Patsy (Brian Bloom, James Hayden), Cockeye (Adrian Curran, William Forsythe) and Dominic (Noah Moazezi), as well as Noodles' long time love interest, Deborah (Jennifer Connelly as a child, and Elizabeth McGovern as an adult). In 1968, after thirty-five years in hiding, Noodles returns to New York City to confront his past and the death of his long-time acquaintances, for whose death he blames himself. The acting in 'Once Upon A Time in America' is absolutely stellar, with highly-dependable leading men De Niro and Woods delivering brilliant performances as life-long friends in a constantly changing personal and professional relationship. The success of the film also hinged largely on the skills of the younger actors, who would be forced to carry lengthy sequences of the narrative on their own. Perhaps surprisingly, they each give assured performances that are very much equal to that of the acting veterans, with particular praise going to Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs and Jennifer Connelly (the now-famous actress who, at just fourteen years of age, was making her cinematic debut). Morricone's low-key but very effective soundtrack, largely employing the use of a pan flute, is soft and reflective, very suited to the sombre tone of the film. At nearly four hours in length, 'Once Upon a Time in America' is not a film that you can just sit down and watch at any time. It requires a little bit of patience and dedication, efforts that will not go unrewarded. When it was released ∂? much to the director's disgust ∂? critics touted the film as ""a Jewish 'Godfather.'"" Perhaps this was not what Leone particularly had in mind, but many parallels can be drawn between the themes and subject matter of these films, and it is highly likely that fans of Francis Ford Coppola's masterpieces will also thoroughly enjoy this film.

71812,tt0033467,ackstasis,australia,9,I don't think any word can explain a man's life,"Orson Welles' debut feature 'Citizen Kane' stands as one of the twentieth century's most revered films, and, indeed, the title of ""The Greatest Film Of All Time"" has often been bestowed upon it, from as early as Sight and Sound's 1962 rankings, when it indefinitely dethroned De Sica's 'Bicycle Thieves (1948).' After two viewings, I can't say that I find it to be the greatest film of all time, but any work with such a label would find it extremely difficult to live up to impossible expectations. Having said that, however, 'Citizen Kane' is nothing short of masterful. In 1939, in an unprecedented studio contract, RKO offered young prodigy Welles, fresh from his success on the stage and the radio, a two-picture contract with full artistic control (a promise that ultimately wasn't kept). Borrowing elements from the lives of tycoons Robert McCormick, Howard Hughes, and Joseph Pulitzer, but especially American newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst, Welles and fellow screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz weaved together the tragic story of Charles Foster Kane, poignantly highlighting the inescapable shortfalls of American Dream. Charlie Kane (Welles) rises from humble beginnings to become one of the most famous and powerful people in America. At a very young age, Kane's mother inherits a gold mine and becomes suddenly wealthy, sending away her son to live with Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), his mother's banker. Proving something of a disappointment for Mr. Thatcher, Kane shows little aspirations for success until the age of twenty-six, when he decides to head the 'Inquirer,' for the simple reason that he ""thinks it would be fun to run a newspaper."" Kane eventually becomes rich and powerful through publishing ""yellow journalism,"" which, though frowned upon by most critics, proves immensely profitable. Decades later, after two unsuccessful marriages and a failed bid for public office, Kane sits alone in his massive, unfinished Xanadu mansion (the most massive, impersonal and even sinister abode ever to grace the silver screen), pining for the lost innocence of his childhood. This is the story of a tragic life, and the ultimate testament that money can't buy happiness. The most remarkable thing about 'Citizen Kane' is its narrative structure. The film opens with Kane's death. As the image fades into a large ""NO TREPASSING"" sign on the gate of Kane's vast and lonely dwelling, we progressively cut to images closer and closer to his house, witnessing the enormity of Kane's wealth, and yet all his riches seem to be in disrepair. A lone lit window stands eerily amidst the snow, before the light inexplicably goes out, the figure hunched within suddenly plunged into darkness. We see Charles Foster Kane's withered hand clasping at a snow-globe, and his lips utter the mystifying words, ""Rosebud."" With a sudden crash, the snow-globe slips from Kane's hand and shatters on the floor. A maidservant enters the room and covers the dead man's body with a blanket. Following his death, the producer of a newsreel about Kane asks a reporter, Jerry Thompson (William Alland), to uncover the significance behind Kane's final words, a well-meaning but rather naive attempt to encapsulate a man's entire life in a simple seven-letter name. A criticism often levelled at 'Citizen Kane' is that it feels less like a warm, involving biopic than a formal masterclass in film-making technique. It's true that Welles was exploring largely unmapped cinematic territory at the time, and there's a certain sense of experimentation about the film. Mankiewicz and Welles constructed the screenplay as a series of fragmented, non-chronological flashbacks, each sequence filling in the missing parts of Kane's life, sometimes even showing the same event from differing perspectives. Greg Toland's elaborate cinematography makes unprecedented use of deep focus, in which everything in the frame ∂? foreground, background and anything in between ∂? is constantly held in sharp focus; the end result is a film that feels far more dynamic and ""animate"" than anything preceding the French New Wave. All innovation aside, anybody who suggests that the life of Charles Foster Kane is somehow uninvolving really needs to revisit the film; Welles pours his heart and soul into portraying the arrogant, tormented and ultimately lonely millionaire, and it's uncanny how the director's own tragic career drew clear parallels with that of his most memorable character.

73004,tt0051201,ackstasis,australia,8,I am constantly surprised that women's hats do not provoke more murders.,"Alfred Hitchcock once remarked that he often had fans approaching him to say how much they enjoyed 'Witness for the Prosecution (1957).' Knowing Hitch's wicked sense of humour, he probably would have gone along with it, but that doesn't change the fact that the film belongs to Billy Wilder, however reminiscent of a Hitchcock picture it might be. Adapted from a short story, and subsequently a play, by mystery author Agatha Christie, the film has a distinct theatrical feel to it, the story gradually unfolding mostly through dialogue, with the occasional important flashback. Just as 'Witness for the Prosecution' feels like the work of the Master of Suspense, it noticeably lacks the classy style of the actual director, with the confines of the courtroom drama perhaps unsuited to Wilder's trademark sparkling repartee {though Charles Laughton certainly gets in a few masterful wise-cracks}. Nevertheless, it is a genuinely thrilling and engaging mystery with an ensemble of terrific characters. Charles Laughton's Sir Wilfrid Robarts is an outrageously entertaining creation. Though having only recently recovered from a crippling heart attack, the attorney maintains a constant state of grumpiness, gruffly dismissing the well-meaning instructions of his insistent nurse, Miss Plimsoll (Laughton's wife, Elsa Lanchester). Though his health often causes him problems, and he hardly seems to be paying attention in the courtroom, Sir Wilfrid is the finest defence lawyer that the city has to offer, a shrewd and calculating legal genius, and a firm believer in the judicial process. When an agitated and seemingly-innocent young man, Leonard Steven Vole (Tyrone Power), is charged for the murder of an older lady friend (Norma Varden), our weary hero commits himself to proving the man's innocence in court, even though their chances of acquittal are seriously marred when the accused man's German ""wife"" (Marlene Dietrich) testifies against him. Much too often, time has ruined some of cinema's greatest twist-endings, and it always grieves me to have the finales of classic thrillers spoiled before I have the opportunity to watch them. In the case of 'Witness for the Prosecution,' I can happily say that I was caught completely off-guard, having not even been aware that the film contained a twist. Better yet, Agatha Christie manages, in the story's final moments, to cram in a quick succession of unexpected plot-turns, with the ending leaving us stunned and dazed, feeling as foolish and devastated as Sir Wilfrid must have been when he realised that he had just unknowingly rescued a certain murderer from punishment. Most definitely in the top five courtroom films I've ever seen, Billy Wilder's 'Witness for the Prosecution' is a different kind of classic for its legendary director, and a motion picture that, yes, I'm sure even Hitchcock would have loved.

He certainly gave us one. 'North by Northwest (1959)' might just be the most outright entertaining of the director's pictures, a film that exists solely to give its audience a rollicking good time. Throughout his career, Hitchcock often utilised his established stars ∂? for example, Cary Grant in 'Suspicion (1941)' or James Stewart in 'Vertigo (1958)' ∂? as an opportunity to deconstruct their ingrained public image. Here, instead, he simply goes with the flow. In his fourth and final film for the Master of Suspense, Cary Grant plays with a familiar persona ∂? debonair and charming, cocky and mischievous. His Roger O. Thornhill (the arbitrary middle initial an overt jab at producer David O. Selznick) is an advertising executive, superficial and self-serving, but with the charisma to support these dastardly qualities. Such a man is surely in need of a comeuppance, and Hitchcock delights in every plot twist that sees Thornhill plunged ever further into a sadistic practical joke cooked up by the Cold War. Ernest Lehman's screenplay outwardly appears to be little but a selection of spectacular set-pieces strung together by Hitchcock's trademark ""wrong man"" motif, but it nonetheless amply supports its running-time (among the director's longest). Cary Grant's charming banter with double-agent Eva Marie Saint is tinged with sly sexual innuendo, and only Hitchcock could have ended a film with the hero's train entering the leading ladies'∂?. well, you get the picture. James Mason brings a dignified vulnerability to the role of Commie spy Phillip Vandamm, but Hitchcock seems only marginally interested in the character, and, indeed, his ultimate fate is completely skipped over (instead, Martin Landau's vicious henchman is given an arch-villain's death). Hitchcock's climax atop a studio reconstruction of Mount Rushmore is only effective thanks to Bernard Hermann's momentous score, but other sequences reek of the director's astonishing aptitude for suspense. The breathless crop-duster ambush is worthy of every accolade that has been bestowed upon it, and Grant's comedic talents shine during both a drunken roadside escape and an impromptu auction-house heckle. That the audience learns of George Kaplan's fictitiousness long before Thornhill ever does may admittedly weaken the suspense, but Hitchcock's motives are instead to recruit the audience into his own position, as director, of omnipotent power. Beneath its surface, 'North by Northwest' appears to be a subtle swing at Cold War politics, and particularly the power wielded by the FBI and government committees like the HUAC. As Thornhill fights to unravel himself from a tangled web of deception and espionage, Hitchcock unexpectedly crosses to a panel of FBI agents, headed by Leo G. Carroll, who bicker indifferently over the mess into which they've got this oblivious pawn. These government employees are happy to sit listlessly by as citizens place their lives on the line, their quarrels bizarrely resembling the conversations of the gods in 'Jason and the Argonauts (1963).' Indeed, like deities, the FBI men wield the power to invent (Kaplan), destroy, or even resurrect (Thornhill) human beings, and intercede sporadically in a suitably Deus Ex Machina-like fashion.  "
73594,tt0052357,ackstasis,australia,9,Give me your hand. Give me your hand,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson has a fear of falling. As the detective dangles precariously from the unstable guttering of a tall building, he impulsively looks downwards to glimpse the distant ground seemingly rushing towards him, all the while paradoxically shifting further and further downwards to maximise his inevitable plummet. This optical effect, sometimes known as a ""contra-zoom,"" ""trombone zoom"" or even the ""Vertigo effect,"" was invented by Irmin Roberts, a Paramount second-unit cameraman, and Alfred's Hitchcock's use of the technique is pivotal to the success of 'Vertigo (1958),' the director's final collaboration with James Stewart. Human eyes interpret the relative dimensions of objects using a combination of size and perspective signals, and the simultaneous forward zoom / reverse track, which alters perspective while maintaining object size, instantly perplexes our eyesight, triggering sensory confusion and successfully mimicking the dizzying sensation of acrophobia. It may not be an incredibly subtle means of communicating Scottie's vertigo, but it's effective, and, particularly in the film's second half, Hitchcock employs a seamless combination of subtle and blatant film-making techniques to polish his landmark thriller. Just a few nights ago, I was fortunate enough to attend a double-bill cinema screening of Alfred Hitchcock's classic thrillers 'Rear Window (1954)' and 'Vertigo (1958),' both starring James Stewart and both among the finest pictures in the director's distinguished repertoire. Both films deal quite substantially with the notion of voyeurism, a topic further explored in Hitchcock's crowning masterpiece, 'Psycho (1960).' 'Rear Window' was the greater crowd-pleaser among the two, replete with gleefully-dark dialogue and a delicious murder mystery glimpsed through the rear window of Stewart's cluttered apartment. 'Vertigo' succeeds on distinctly-different terms: though rather lumbering and morose in comparison, the film is easily the Hitchcock's most intense thriller, with little of the playfully-black humour to be found in most of the director's acknowledged classics. This being my second viewing, it was interesting to note a film divided into two rather-incompatible halves, one a leisurely, borderline-supernatural ghost story, and the other a vivid exploration of loss and obsession. It's a curious combination, but it's also an altogether fascinating one. The film's opening half concerns acrophobic detective Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart), who has retired from the police force after his disability caused the death of a colleague. An old colleague, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), hires Scottie is surveil his wife Madelaine (Kim Novak), whom he tentatively suspects of having been inhabited by the spirit of a tragic-afflicted ancestress. Hitchcock confidently strings together a series of surveillance episodes, as Scottie tails Madelaine across San Francisco, observing her fixation with her nineteenth-century counterpart, culminating in an attempted suicide at the base of the Golden Gate Bridge. These sequences move at an unhurried pace, usually with extended periods of silence, underscored by Bernard Hermann's eerie soundtrack. However, to one with prior knowledge of the story's eventual conclusion, these comprehensive episodes of observation seem rather superfluous, a deception that exists as a trifling footnote to the film's primary concerns, of obsession and doomed passion. In any case, Scottie soon finds himself falling in love with Madelaine, and, when she is tragically wrenched from his grasp, his own grip on reality begins to falter. The film's second half, following Madelaine's apparent suicide, marks a crucial turning-point in both the story and our perception of the major characters. James Stewart, long considered the ""everyday man"" with his shy and polite demeanour, suddenly descends into darkened territory, emerging from his cocoon of self-pitying isolation only after attaining a streak of relief from the face of a passing stranger, Judy Barton (Kim Novak again). In a wretched bid to recapture the passion of his lost love, Scottie forcefully alters Judy's appearance to reconstruct Madelaine's image, and, in one of Hitchcock's all-time most powerful moments, the pair embrace in a hotel room, the camera spinning deliriously about them as their surroundings modify to momentarily evoke the memory of Scottie and Madelaine's final, blissful kiss. However, in choosing to construct a superficial duplicate of his love, Scottie has effectively thwarted any romantic future, and, when it is revealed that Judy and Madelaine were the very same person ∂? the fabrication of an elaborate murder plot ∂? he comes to realise that, not only had he initially ""fallen"" for an illusion, but his own self-made illusion was equally unviable, if not more so.

There are two things happening in this film: one that Kubrick inherited from Burgess' writing, and another that is endemic to the cinematic medium. The first role of 'A Clockwork Orange (1971)' is as a rather vicious political satire, dryly mocking the hypocrisy of the government and its policies on institutionalisation and criminal rehabilitation. In the film, the Minister of the Interior (Anthony Sharp) is depicted as opportunistic and self-serving, latching onto the unproven Ludovico technique in a bid to stem his party's failing popularity with voters. When public opinion turns against the therapy, the Minister very swiftly back-peddles, reversing the treatment so that Alex may return to his former ultra-violent ways: ""I was cured alright!"" The UK edition of Burgess' novel contained a final chapter in which Alex sees the error of his former ways, and vows to reform into a productive member of society. Kubrick was unaware of this addition until he had almost completed the screenplay, and never considered using it in the film. This was, I think, a good decision. Burgess' ending shies away from the problem: by letting human nature run its course, he seems to be implying that the problem of juvenile delinquency will sort itself out. Kubrick, admittedly, doesn't offer any solutions of his own, but the corrupt manner in which he ends the film leaves a sour taste. The Ludovico technique involves the screening of movies, which also allows Kubrick room for a degree of self-referentiality. It is in the audiences' nature to recoil from acts of sex and violence, and Kubrick's hard-nosed, deliberately-subversive approach (utilising the perspective of its biased protagonist and narrator) only encourages this response. Just as Alex is exposed to the Ludovico aversion therapy, Kubrick is exposing his audience to the same treatment. Does it work? Do we become desensitised to the violence, or do we begin to associate socially- accepted cues (i.e. Beethoven's Ninth, ""Singing in the Rain"") with acts of evil?  "
80487,tt0056172,ackstasis,australia,10,Nothing is written.,"The parched vastness of the desert stretches beyond the horizon in every direction. The glorious morning sun begins to rise from beneath the earth, casting brilliant rays of searing light across the scorched landscape. In the distance, barely noticeable to the human eye, a dark speck appears. We watch, we wait. The tiny approaching figure, ever so gradually, moves tantalisingly closer, and we lean forward to discern it, the enormity of the Arabian desert instantly enveloping us, consuming us. We are there. When a character gazes up at the blazing overhead sun ∂? an immense ball of fire in the sky ∂? we feel it burning our skin, and we, too, yearn for that life-saving swig of water. David Lean's epic masterpiece, 'Lawrence of Arabia,' is one of those precious few films that is capable of completely absorbing the audience into its world. Just like Stanley Kubrick's sci-fi masterwork '2001: A Space Odyssey' of 1968, the plot of the film is not what we ultimately remember. When asked why it is such a great film, we can only recall the sheer majesty of the images that have been permanently seared into our minds ∂? Lawrence blows out a burning match, which becomes the rising desert sun; a stranded soldier, stumbling across the sands, gazes up in horror as the first rays of morning sunlight beam across the land; a triumphant Lawrence, dressed in flowing white robes, poses at the summit of an enemy trainwreck, the sun glimmering behind him as if he is a god. Minute after minute, for the entire four-hour running time, we are simply bombarded with unforgettable images, thanks to the Freddie Young's acclaimed Super Panavision 70 cinematography, a stirring score from Maurice Jarre and director David Lean's epic cinematic vision. Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward ""T.E."" Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) died on May 19, 1935 after a horrific motorcycle accident. He was honoured with a bust in St. Paul's Cathedral for his liaison role during the Arab Revolt of 1916-18, his achievements made famous by the sensationalised newspaper writings of American journalist Lowell Thomas, who is represented in the film by the character of Jackson Bentley (Arthur Kennedy). Lawrence's funeral leaves us with several unanswered questions regarding what sort of man he really was: was he a ""poet, a scholar and a mighty warrior,"" or, as Bentley suggests after the departure of the reporter, ""the most shameless exhibitionist since Barnum & Bailey?"" 'Lawrence of Arabia,' very loosely based on Lawrence's personal memoirs, shows how, throughout his exploits in Arabia, he was a man trapped between two cultures, torn between his allegiances to Britain and its army, and to his newfound comrades within the Arabian desert tribes, to whom he had promised freedom. He also battles to understand his own emotional reactions towards violence in war, his uncertainty beginning with the shocking satisfaction he experiences upon executing one of his companions. Early in his exploits, Lawrence embodies the qualities present in all great historical heroes: courage and determination, self-assurance and loyalty. Nearing the end of a harrowing march across the impassable Nefud Desert, though ragged from exhaustion and desperate for hydration, Lawrence turns his camel around in search of Gasim, a fellow comrade who was unknowingly left behind after succumbing to sleep and falling off his mount. However, as Lawrence's victories become many, he finds that his humility has been replaced with arrogance, and his bravery with blood-thirsty cowardice. The acting performances in this film are absolutely stunning all-round. Peter O'Toole (""The Lion in Winter"") is undeniably brilliant as T.E. Lawrence, masterfully portraying a complex character in his debut high-profile role. It is perhaps unfortunate that he came up against Gregory Peck's equally memorable role as Atticus Finch in 'To Kill A Mockingbird' at the 1963 Oscars, otherwise he most certainly would have won Best Actor. To this day, despite a total of eight nominations, O'Toole remains without a competitive Oscar, though he did receive an Academy Honorary Award in 2003 for his collective body of work. A stunning supporting cast complements O'Toole's performance, and the film simply could not have been as powerful if any of the supporting roles were anything less than perfect. Alec Guiness (""The Bridge on the River Kwai"") ∂? who had originally wanted the role of Lawrence, but was turned down due to his age ∂? plays Prince Feisal, the Arab leader who learns to value Lawrence's advice and assistance. Anthony Quinn (""Zorba the Greek"") portrays Auda ibu Tayi, the leader of the Howeitat tribe of Bedouin Arabs, whom Lawrence convinces to invade the city of Aqaba. Omar Sharif is brilliant as Sheriff Ali, a man who inexplicably becomes Lawrence's most loyal comrade, though he fears what his good friend has become in the face of success. Other notable performances in the film come from Jack Hawkins, Claude Rains, Anthony Quayle, Arthur Kennedy and Jos«∏ Ferrer. In terms of David Lean's vast artistic vision, 'Lawrence of Arabia' is one of the most ambitious cinematic undertakings of all time. This is truly one of the grandest epics ever made, demanding to be witnessed only in the cinema; put quite simply, a minute television screen just does not do this film justice. This is an life-changing experience like few others, and, for 220 glorious minutes, you can almost see yourself in the desert, sitting atop a camel, trekking across the sands alongside one of the twentieth century's most fascinating historical figures.

80983,tt0056592,ackstasis,australia,10,You never really understand a person... until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it,"'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' has stayed with me since the time I first saw it, perhaps because the film caught me at an impressionable age. This was in 2004, not a particularly long time ago, but it feels an age away. High school greets you at a young, idealistic age, when the world sits at your fingertips just waiting for you to take it. Having just read Harper Lee's Pullitzer Prize-winning novel in English class, we followed it with Robert Mulligan's film adaptation, which scored an Oscar for Gregory Pick and would have won Best Picture had David Lean not hustled in with his masterpiece. Even when lamentably broken up into fifty-minute intervals, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' left me captivated by its magic ∂? and, yes, there is magic. Though typically celebrated as a statement on racial prejudice in the American South, the true core of both Lee's novel and Mulligan's film is distanced from Tom Robinson's rape trial, and lies in terrible, wonderful and beautiful experience of growing up. The film, as in Lee's novel, is told through the eyes of Scout Finch (Mary Badham; voiced by Kim Stanley as an adult), the tomboyish daughter of small-town lawyer Atticus (Gregory Peck) and younger sister of Jem (Phillip Alford). Along with visiting neighbour Dill (John Megna), the two siblings whittle away their summers obsessing over local recluse ""Boo"" Radley, an agoraphobic, mentally-ill man towards whom the children develop both a fear and fascination. Meanwhile, Atticus is appointed to defend an African American (Brock Peters) accused of raping a white woman, and his determination to give the man a fair trial leads to heated racial tensions in the bigoted Southern township. 'To Kill A Mockingbird' follows Jem and Scout as they go about the processes of growing up, learning of the bitter immorality and prejudice that lurks beyond the security of their home. Ironically, the film is weakest during its narrative crux ∂? Tom Robinson's courtroom trial ∂? as Mulligan strains to keep the story focused around the children, though Peck's virtuous performance compensates for the lapse. I've never quite been able to put my fingers around why 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is, to me, such an emotionally-draining (and fulfilling) picture. Perhaps it's Elmer Bernstein's musical score, sad and wistful, like the lamentation of a fairy-tale punctuated by reality. Childhood itself is not unlike a fairy-tale, a time of infallible ideals and black-and-white ethics. Mulligan justly celebrates the steadfast moral courage of Atticus Finch, but the overriding emotion at Tom Robinson's sentencing is instead one of sinking disillusionment: while Scout watches on, uncomprehending, Jem buries his head in his arms, his childish conviction in the goodness of adults irreparably shattered. Yet, even then, hope survives for those who, like the Finch family, preserve their moral integrity. The film's fairy-tale mood, at times reminiscent of Laughton's 'The Night of the Hunter (1957),' is enforced most strongly in the children's' final walk through the forest, described as their ""longest journey together."" Arthur ""Boo"" Radley, a mockingbird who might have been destroyed by less sympathetic souls, ultimately becomes their saviour.  "
82016,tt0338013,ackstasis,australia,9,How happy is the blameless vestal's lot,"After a long-term relationship goes sour, Joel (Jim Carrey) is shocked to learn that Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had him erased from her memory. Joel decides to undergo the same procedure himself, but decides midstream that some memories are worth hanging onto. Charlie Kaufman's films explore the workings of the human mind: 'Adaptation (2002)' traced the neurotic exchanges between an artist and his art; 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)' is about how memories influence our relationships with others; I'm yet to work out what 'Being John Malkovich (1999)' was all about, but at least it had fun going about it. As was the case with Spike Jonze, Kaufman found in Michel Gondry a director who shared his unique perspective on life and art. 'Eternal Sunshine' is eccentric without being outwardly quirky, and Gondry's creative flair for optical trickery (sharpened through his work on music videos) is perfect for recreating the labyrinthine cubicles of the human mind. 'Eternal Sunshine' is perhaps the only film I've seen whose narrative moves both forwards and backwards at the same time. It has been said that ""those who forget history are doomed to repeat it."" The film concludes with a single memory skipping back on itself, suggesting that Joel and Clementine are trapped in this endless cycle of ""love,"" heartbreak and erasure for the rest of their lives {indeed, an early screenplay draft depicted this idea more explicitly}. This outcome is mirrored in the relationship between Dr. Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson) and secretary Mary (Kirsten Dunst), who repeat their affair even after Mary undergoes the Lacuna procedure. As in 'Adaptation,' this ending demonstrates Kaufman's talent for depicting failure in the misleading guise of hope; just as Nicolas Cages' screenwriter flounders in his attempts to write an original Hollywood script, Joel and Clementine willingly doom themselves towards a life almost entirely devoid of lasting memories.

83216,tt0086879,ackstasis,australia,9,"God was singing through this little man to all the world, unstoppable, making my defeat more bitter with every passing bar.","Though Milos Forman is rarely mentioned among the greats of Hollywood directing, he has certainly left an indelible mark on cinema. Creator of at least two indisputable masterpieces, Forman's films have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards on two occasions, and he has also won the Best Director Oscar for these two same films. The film that brought most of his initial fame was the glorious 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' of 1975, based on the popular novel by Ken Kesey and starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. In the next nine years, Forman only produced another three films: 'Hair,' 'Ragtime' and 'Amadeus,' respectively. Released in 1984, 'Amadeus' is based on the 1979 stage play by Peter Shaffer, which was inspired by Aleksandr Pushkin's short play, ""Mozart and Salieri,"" and loosely traces the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The film opens with Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in a mental institution, after having attempted suicide. Now old and frail, he speaks to a young priest (Herman Meckler),who has come to hear his confession. Salieri expresses bitterness that his former-talents have faded into obscurity with passing time, whilst the works of the young prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce) have become legendary. Having known of the talented composer for most of his life, and having developed a hatred towards Mozart because of his own inferiority, Salieri ultimately blames himself for his death. Through his confession to the priest, Salieri explains how his association with Mozart destroyed his entire life. It is perhaps surprising to newcomers that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is not the main character in the film. As the skilled but envious Antonio Salieri, F. Murray Abraham is the epitome of good acting, delivering a dark and brooding performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Abraham is mesmeric as the successful composer who makes a pact with God to be the greatest in history, in exchange for his complete and unwavering devotion. When it appears that this gift has been bestowed upon another, Salieri rejects the Lord, and makes it his life's mission to destroy the talented young man through whom God speaks His voice. Tom Hulce, despite also being nominated for Best Actor for his role, is often cited as the one misstep of the film. I completely disagree, since the idea that Hulce feels out-of-place is the very point that the film is trying to make. When he hears of all that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has accomplished, Salieri was expecting to meet a sombre, respectable genius, only to first come across Mozart crawling on the floor, engaged in vulgar sex-games and uttering jokes about flatulence. This is what ultimately leads Salieri to abandon his pact with God: after all his own unwavering loyalty, how could the Lord have chosen this ""unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat"" through which to channel His voice? Of course Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart was juvenile and somewhat irritating, since it was supposed to be. Hulce based his character's annoying laugh on real descriptions of the composer, which referred to it as ""an infectious giddy"" and ""like metal scraping glass."" Also, though the historical accuracy of Shaffer's play was met with much scrutiny, it appears authentic (if slightly over-exaggerated) that Mozart had something of a vulgar and loutish personality. For example, it is known that the famed composer wrote canons on the the words ""Leck mich im Arsch"" and ""Leck mich im Arsch recht fein sch«Ùn sauber"" as party pieces for his friends. However, the supposed rivalry between Salieri and Mozart is most likely completely fictional. In real life, Salieri frequently lent Mozart musical scores from the court library with which he was charged; he often chose compositions by Mozart for performance at state occasions, and Salieri taught Mozart's son, Franz Xaver. Despite running for almost three hours, 'Amadeus' is a surprisingly easy movie to sit through, helped along by brilliant performances and a brisk pace. The use of a classical musical score ∂? mostly comprised of Mozart's pieces, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner at the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields ∂? is positively perfect for the film, proving that, even though he lived many centuries ago, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is still far better than even the most gifted cinema composers of the twentieth century.  "
84595,tt0062622,ackstasis,australia,10,Its origin and purpose still a total mystery,"Beauty is an often-overlooked component of modern film-making. We are often so overwhelmed by complex story lines and fast-paced action that we forget to simply sit back and admire the sheer beauty of celluloid. Engineered with intricate precision by passionate, experienced hands, a film can transcend the boundaries of simply being a film. It can become a work of art. '2001: A Space Odyssey' is not a film to be watched by one in any hurry. To the unprepared viewer, the leisurely pace of the narrative may first come across as ""slow"" or ""tedious."" However, to those lucky enough to be able to appreciate its brilliance, the film is a relaxing, meditative journey that you can't expect to forget any time soon. The film relies, not on dialogue, but on stunning visual imagery and an eerily appropriate classical score, to explore its themes and advance the limited plot. In fact, the first spoken word appears almost thirty minutes into the film, and, in total, less than forty minutes of dialogue constitutes the total running time. Following the enormous success of his classic apocalyptic black comedy, 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964),' director Stanley Kubrick became enthralled by the possibility of extraterrestrial life, and so collaborated with noted English sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke to create ""the proverbial good science fiction movie."" The two decided to adapt and expand Clarke's early short story, ""The Sentinel,"" written in 1948 and first published in 1951. In a nutshell, and at its most literal level, '2001: A Space Odyssey' tells the story of Mankind's evolution, either prompted or surveilled by ominous black Monoliths, the tools of an unseen advanced extraterrestrial civilisation. Through the coldly-sinister HAL9000 computer (chillingly voiced by Douglas Rain), Kubrick also explores the expanding role that technology will play in the future, and whether or not our complete dependence upon it will inevitably result in our own destruction {also an important theme in 'Dr. Strangelove'}. Many of the film's detractors often complain that the story poses complex questions about Mankind's origin and place in the Universe, but without offering any answers of any kind. I can see how the film's ""open-endedness"" might be infuriating to those who are eager for a neatly-packaged explanation, but I wouldn't have it any other way. Though one might miss it on first viewing, Kubrick has plenty to say about the way he views humanity. For example, the opening ""Dawn of Man"" sequence depicts the crumbling society of the early hominids, as they attempt futilely to scrounge out an existence in the arid landscape. The inexplicable arrival of the Monolith (accompanied by Gy«Ùrgy Ligeti's endlessly-creepy ""Requiem"") precipitates a profound change in the mental capabilities of the Apemen ∂? they are now able to exploit tools to stay alive. That famed match-cut from the soaring bone to the orbiting spacecraft four million years later is so simple, and yet it conveys so much about the human race. Worth noting is that Kubrick originally intended those spacecraft to be orbiting nuclear weapons {the Cold War being at its peak around the time of the film's production}. The cut is a way of enforcing that, given his intelligence, Man will always use it to develop ways to destroy himself (remembering that the bone was used to kill the leader of an enemy tribe). Another sequence that remains hotly-debated almost four decades after the film's release is the controversial ending, a psychedelic wormhole of colour produced by effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull using slit-scan photography. Following his journey through the ""Stargate"" ∂? a breathtaking trip across the bizarre expanses of the Universe ∂? Dave Bowman is deposited in a sort of fourth-dimensional observational chamber, its classical decorations both familiar and alien, where the greater beings who engineered the Monoliths can keep an invisible eye on him. In this room, having finally defeated his tools, Man must face one final challenge: his own death. Throughout history, human evolution depended so much upon its technology/tools that it almost replaced us. In the end, it tried to destroy us (i.e. HAL). Now, just moments from the death of Mankind, separated from his tools, what do we have left? The final act of a dying Dave is to reach out his withered hand towards the Monolith that stands before him. This image of 'reaching out' with an extended finger was directly borrowed by Kubrick from the famous painting found in Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel artwork -- of Man extending his finger to touch God's hand. Note how, following Dave's epic transformation/rebirth into a Starchild, Kubrick juxtaposes the Earth's razor-thin atmosphere with the frail fetus in its womb, stressing the fragility, preciousness and vulnerability of the planet on which we dwell. There's really no adequate way to explain why '2001' is such a magnificent and special film to me. It is, above all else, a motion picture that appeals to our emotions, and the feelings of awe, wonderment and terror that overcome me are simply indescribable. In judging films, I prefer to reserve the term ""masterpiece"" for the films capable of completely drawing me into their world, of making me forget that I'm watching a movie. I want to feel as though I am there. Shortly put, '2001' achieves this more effectively than any other film I have ever experienced. If you need any further explanation of why I value this film so greatly, then consider my experiences with one particular sequence: Dave Bowman, in order to re-access the Discovery and disconnect HAL, must enter the spaceship through the emergency airlock, exposing himself to a total vacuum for an extended period of time. As the breathable air finally began to fill Dave's surroundings, I found myself taking a breath for the first time in almost half a minute. I was there.  "
85425,tt0040522,ackstasis,australia,9,You live and you suffer.,"Sometimes the most beautiful stories ever told are also the simplest. Unburdened by sudden plot twists or multiple character arcs, these stories are able to take the time to truly focus on their characters, allowing us to absorb every minute detail, each moment presented to us with stark realism. Vittorio De Sica's 'The Bicycle Thief' (or, if you take the literal translation from the Italian title, 'Bicycle Thieves') is such a story. The plot itself is surprisingly simple: a poor family man, Antonio Ricci (Lamberto Maggiorani) manages to acquire a well-paying job, in an era when well-paying jobs are almost impossible to find. To keep the job, however, he needs to have his bicycle, and when it is stolen from him when his back in momentarily turned, Antonio fears that his job ∂? and his family ∂? is doomed to suffer. Accompanied by his bright-eyed, intelligent young son, Bruno (Enzo Staiola), Antonio travels across Rome in search of his bicycle. 'The Bicycle Thief' is often cited as one of the most accomplished examples of neorealism, and rightly so. Though I was initially unfamiliar with the term, neorealism is a cultural movement that brings elements of true life in the stories it describes, and the movement was primarily developed in Europe after World War Two. In this film, we are not treated to an happy endings, of always-loving characters with broad smiles departing into the glorious sunset. Antonio and Bruno, having not recovered the bike, disappear soundlessly into a crowd of disheartened poor men, their meagre problems amounting to nothing amidst the widespread poverty in post-war Rome. We may not necessarily enjoy this bleak, somewhat pessimistic conclusion, but the film is all the more poignant and emotionally moving for it. Cary Grant and Henry Fonda were originally considered for the main role in the film, before director Vittorio De Sica opted to use nonprofessional actors. The two main stars, Maggiorani and Staiola, were, in fact, chosen for their respective roles based solely on the styles of their walks. Lamberto Maggiorani does a remarkable job in his film debut as the hopeless and anguished poor man battling to provide for his family, whilst Enzo Staiola's wide-eyed curiosity ∂? always looking upwards towards his father for guidance ∂? is perfect for the role of the young son. Together, Antonio and Bruno display a fascinating father-son intimacy. And, even over just a few days, we are able to witness the ever-so-subtle highs and lows of their relationship. Also notable is Lianella Carell, likewise in her film debut, as Antonio's ever-worrying wife, Maria.  "
86559,tt0045152,ackstasis,australia,9,The new Don Lockwood. He yodels; he jumps around to music!,"Just to get the record straight, I don't really like musicals. Whilst I'm fond of most cinematic genres, the musical has been one to which I have been rather averse. Perhaps it is the sheer absurdity of a character suddenly breaking into song at the most inopportune moment, or maybe it is the films' tendencies to have a flimsy story connecting the numerous song-and-dance numbers. In any case, it is the mark of a truly great musical when it makes me completely forget that I don't really like musicals, and 'Singin' in the Rain' is certainly one example. It must also be telling that, after seeing the film, I spent the rest of the day treading down the rain-soaked paths and singing the title song to myself, and I continued to do this for at least the next three days, even after any traces of precipitation had long-since cleared. Following the great success of 'An American in Paris' a year earlier, 'Singin' in the Rain' was co-directed by Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly, and is set in 1927 ∂? appropriately, the year of cinema's transition from silent films to ""talkies."" Don Lockwood (Kelly) is silent cinemas biggest star, featuring in a string of monumental financial successes for Monumental Pictures, usually opposite the glamorous Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen), who can't comprehend that Lockwood only acts affectionate towards her for his films' publicity. With the release of 'The Jazz Singer,' every studio is eager to cash-in on the demand for talkies, but Don and Lina find themselves with a problem: Lina's shrill New York accent definitely does not complement her glamorous public image. After their share of difficulties ∂? including one hilarious, trouble-plagued test screening for Don and Lina's new film, ""The Dueling Cavalier"" ∂? a possible solution is happened upon. Don's energetic best friend Cosmo Brown (Donald O'Connor) and pretty, young Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds, just 20 years of age when the film was released) suggest turning the disaster of a movie into a musical ∂? ""The Dancing Cavalier"" ∂? with Kathy dubbing all of Lina's dialogue and singing. Of course, not everything goes quite to plan, particularly when the selfish and arrogant Lina finds out about this and tries to have Kathy stripped off all the credit for her excellent work. What sets 'Singin' in the Rain' apart from almost every other musical is the story. Whilst it's obvious that most of the songs were selected well before the plot was formulated ∂? sometimes the musical numbers go off on an unnecessary tangent that is irrelevant to the story ∂? no true fan of cinema can go past a film about Hollywood itself. The actual storyline is genuinely engaging, and Lina turns into quite a loathsome villainess by the end of the film, especially when her selfishness threatens to destroy the career of one so innocent and promising as young Kathy. Gene Kelly is great in the main role, his superb confidence and boyish charm, coupled with flawless singing and dancing skills, helping to make him one of Hollywood's most fondly-remembered stars. Debbie Reynolds was also very good, despite reportedly having a difficult time on set, her underdeveloped dancing skills often incurring Gene Kelly's frustration. Donald O'Connor, who I can't believe I've never heard about before, is absolutely phenomenal throughout, his every appearance funny, energetic and memorable. Likewise, Jean Hagen savours every moment as the dim but influential Lina Lamont, earning an Oscar nominations for her troubles. Of course, the true highlights of ""Singin' in the Rain' are the musical numbers. Whilst very few of the songs are original to the film (for example, the title song was taken from 'Hollywood Revue of 1929'), the use of each is so inspired that they now forever associated with it. I'm not particularly a fan of the slow, romantic love songs, but some of the more lively tunes appealed to me greatly. ""Singin' in the Rain,"" performed by Gene Kelly on a rainswept nighttime street, has now becoming legendary, superbly demonstrating how Don's love for Kathy has eradicated all of his troubles and left him blissfully happy. O'Connor's energetic rendition of ""Make 'Em Laugh,"" in which he somersaults off the walls of a movie set, left him in a state of extreme exhaustion. ""Good Morning,"" a catchy little tune performed by Kelly, O'Connor and Reynolds was also nice to watch. Perhaps the film's centrepiece, Kelly's ""Broadway Melody Ballet"" has little to do with the plot of the film, but it is such an astounding flurry of colour and excitement that I am willing to forgive its running a bit overlong. For fans of musicals, 'Singin' in the Rain' is a treat for the eyes and the ears. Indeed, even for people who have little interest in watching musicals, you shouldn't give up on the genre until you have at least seen this one.  "
88096,tt0012349,ackstasis,australia,8,The Tramp goes feature-length,"Charles Chaplin was born on April 16, 1889, in East Street, Walworth, London. Though his parents, both music hall entertainers, separated before his third birthday, they also raised him into the entertainment business. His first appearance on film was in 'Making a Living (1914),' a one-reel comedy released on February 2, 1914. It didn't take long for Chaplin to find his niche in the film-making industry, and his character of the Tramp ∂? who first appeared in 'Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914)' ∂? guaranteed his popularity and longevity in the industry. After a string of successful short films, among the most accomplished of which are 'Shoulder Arms (1918)' and 'A Dog's Life (1918),' Chaplin commenced production on his first feature-length outing with the Tramp. 'The Kid (1921)' proved an instant success, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1921 {behind Rex Ingram's 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921)'} and ensuring another fifteen years of comedies featuring Chaplin's most enduring character. 'The Kid' opens in somewhat sombre circumstances, as a struggling entertainer (Chaplin regular Edna Purviance) emerges from the hospital clasping her unwanted child. Unable, or perhaps unwilling, to care for the infant, she regretfully abandons the baby in an automobile, which is promptly hijacked by unscrupulous criminals. The car thieves discard the orphan in a garbage-strewn alleyway, at which point our humble vagrant hero comes tramping down the street. Upon his discovery of the little bundle-of-joy, Chaplin demonstrates the most practical response, and glances inquiringly upwards, both at the apartment windows through which residents like to toss their leftovers, and at the Heavens, who conceivably might have dropped a newborn from the sky. After several awkward attempts to unload the baby on somebody else, Chaplin lovingly decides to raise the kid himself, crudely fashioning the necessities of child-raising (a milk bottle, a toilet seat) from his own modest possessions. Five years on, the Kid (Jackie Coogan) has blossomed into a devoted and energetic sidekick, a partner-in-crime if you will, and it is then that Chaplin's fatherhood is placed in jeopardy. The Tramp's young co-star was the son of an actor, and Chaplin first discovered him during a vaudeville performance, when the four-year-old entertained audiences with the ""shimmy,"" a popular dance at the time. Chaplin was delighted with Coogan's natural talent for mimicry, and his ability to precisely impersonate the Tramp's unique expressions and mannerisms ∂? becoming, in effect, a childhood version of Chaplin ∂? was crucial to the film's success. The domestic bond exhibited by the pair is faultless in every regard, and, adding to the poignancy of their relationship, Chaplin began work on the production just days after the death of his own three-day-old newborn son, Norman Spencer Chaplin (during his short-lived marriage to child actor Mildred Harris). The mutual compassion and understanding underlying the central father-son relationship remains very touching nearly ninety years later, particularly when the pair employ their combined talents to promote the continued prolificacy of the Tramp's window-repair business. However, even during proceedings as ordinary as a pancake breakfast, that the two share a genuine affection for one another is beyond question. According to Chaplin's autobiography, actor Jack Coogan, Sr (who plays several minor roles throughout the film, including the troublesome Devil in the dream sequence) told his young son that, if he couldn't cry convincingly, he'd be sent to a workhouse for real. We can never know for certain if this was the case, but what we do know is that, during the separation sequence, young Coogan delivers one of the most heart-wrenching child performances ever committed to the screen, his hands stretched outwards in a grief-stricken plea for mercy. His performance is intercut with Chaplin grappling frantically with the authorities, his widened eyes staring directly at the camera, as though actively pleading for the audience's sympathy and assistance; it's one of the director's all-time most unforgettable moments, and first decisive instance that Chaplin was able to so seamlessly blend humour and pathos. In the 1970s, Chaplin ∂? ever the perfectionist ∂? re-released the film with a newly-composed score, and deleted three additional sequences involving Purviance as the orphan's mother, which might explain why the kid's father (Carl Miller) apparently serves no use to the story.

89226,tt0059578,ackstasis,australia,7,"When the chimes end, pick up your gun","Watching 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)' is a bit like experiencing vertigo, the camera zooming in and pulling back at the same time. Sergio Leone's explosive Spaghetti Western debut 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' was produced on a shoestring budget, and, though the financial restraints are easily noticeable in the final cut, the film has such a unique visual style that it didn't really matter. For his follow-up, Leone had a considerably-larger budget with which to toil, and the result is a more coherent and assured editing style, the work of consummate professional. However, at the same time, this creative progression has a simultaneous detrimental effect. Leone, in attempting to craft a (slightly) more conventional picture, was now less inclined to indulge in the unashamedly erratic editing ∂? such as instant cuts from vast landscapes to sweat-soaked eyes ∂? that had made his previous film so utterly unique. Nevertheless, great film-making is about finding that ideal balance, and it's reassuring to note that the director did eventually strike it with his next picture, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).' In a decade when the Western was beginning to fall out of favour, many Italian directors decided to attempt their own interpretations of the genre, none more successfully than Sergio Leone. These ""Spaghetti Westerns"" dispensed with all respectability that the genre had once possessed, saturating the cinema screen with sweat, blood and smoke. His films are not particularly intellectual, but generations of audiences have delighted in the director's sheer enthusiasm for providing entertainment, and his ""Dollars"" trilogy is now regarded as a classic. 'For a Few Dollars More' was produced second in the loose trilogy, but, chronologically, its storyline is the last to take place. Clint Eastwood returned from his previous star-making performance as the enigmatic ""Man With No Name"" {though he does, in fact, go by the title Monco}, and Gian Maria Volont«˘ is deliciously-evil as the ultimate bad guy, El Indio. Though I had fully expected Lee Van Cleef to be also playing a villain, Douglas Mortimer, a respected colonel-turned-bounty hunter, turned out to be a highly-reputable figure, and his performance is marked by a subtle humour that contrasts well with Eastwood's ""straight man."" The film opens with an ominous intertitle: ""where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared."" These bounty-hunters turn out to be the film's heroes, and we can only watch in awe as Manco and Mortimer expertly go about their daily profession, tracking down wanted fugitives, swiftly murdering them (typically after offering an opportunity to defend themselves) and claiming the hefty reward. Beyond their grizzled exterior, each man has a very definite reason for their chosen line of work: Monco wishes to amass enough money to retire somewhere quiet, and Mortimer is out to avenge the rape and death of his sister. But what happens when the two professional killers set their sights on the same target, perhaps the most lucrative prize of all? Will they decide to cooperate, or will they end up shooting each other in the back? There is a wonderful sequence where the two bounty-hunters match wits, progressively humiliating each other in a bizarre ritual that involves shooting the other man's hat. Also watch out for Klaus Kinski, in that ""psycho"" mode that only he could play to perfection.  "
89306,tt0042876,ackstasis,australia,8,I don't understand my own soul.,"Akira Kurosawa is unquestionably the most recognised film-making talent ever to emerge from Japan, his string of reputed masterpieces including 'The Seven Samurai (1954),' 'Yojimbo (1961)' and 'Ran (1985),' each of which I have yet to enjoy, my experience with Asian cinema worryingly limited. After recently enjoying my first Kurosawa picture, the powerful but slightly-overlong 'Nora inu / Stray Dog (1949),' I was keen to watch another, though I couldn't yet find the time to commit myself to one of the director's three-hour-long epics. 'Rash«Ômon (1950)' proved the perfect alternative. Kurosawa's film, the first to bring him into the international limelight, uses a simple story ∂? of a husband's death in the woods ∂? to reveal a simple but worryingly-accurate truth of human existence: that the truth itself is unknowable. The unique narrative structure of the film, of replaying the same event four times from differing perspectives, had the potential to become nothing more than a curious gimmick, yet Kurosawa makes it all work wonderfully, aided by the exquisite cinematography of Kazuo Miyagawa and electric performances from all involved, most particularly Kurosawa-regular Toshir«Ô Mifune. The film opens in a bleak, bitter rainstorm ∂? one of those mighty skyward torrents that makes us drought-stricken Australians green with envy ∂? where three men are sheltering in the ruins of a gatehouse. Three days previously, the oldest of the three, Woodcutter (Takashi Shimura), discovered the body of a man in the woods, and has recently returned from a police inquiry. The coarse, unkempt Commoner (Kichijiro Ueda) demands to hear the remainder of the Woodcutter's story, and so he recounts three ""versions"" of the shocking rape/murder, told from the perspective of the Bandit (Toshir«Ô Mifune), the husband (Masayuki Mori) and the wife (Machiko Ky«Ô), each story differing substantially from the other two. The existence of subjectivity, it seems, has permanently obscured any chances of ever knowing the absolute ""truth"" of the incident, with each perspective ∂? perhaps deliberately, perhaps subconsciously ∂? distorting the truth to conform to their own interests. It is revealed that even the seemingly-passive observer, Woodcutter, has his own reasons for adjusting the facts, this final revelation almost permanently denting the honest Priest's (Minoru Chiaki) belief in the goodness of Mankind. After portraying a modest, tentative rookie detective in Kurosawa's 'Stray Dog,' Toshir«Ô Mifune is an absolute revelation as the notorious Taj«Ômaru. Regardless of the specific version of events, Mifune unequivocally dominates the screen, his maniacal energy and frenzied cackle certain to imprint on your mind. The basis for the film was derived from two stories by RyèÆnosuke Akutagawa, with ""Rashomon"" providing the setting, and ""In a Grove"" supplying the characters and plot. The flashback components of the story unfold under the dappled light of the trees, and, on several occasion,s Miyagawa films the Sun directly through the leaves of the forest canopy, perhaps representative of the ""light of truth"" that is being obscured by the inherent dishonesty in Man {personified in the selfish Commoner}. Of course, Kurosawa couldn't bring himself to end the film in such a pessimistic fashion, and the Woodcutter redeems his previous deception by offering to care for an abandoned newborn baby discovered in the gatehouse. As the rainstorm ceases, and the glorious sunlight once again begins to beam down upon the lands, the Priest finally regains his faith in the goodness to be found in a man's heart.  "
89935,tt0053604,ackstasis,australia,9,That's the way it crumbles... cookie-wise.,"If I ever had any doubts that Billy Wilder was one of Hollywood's all-time greatest directors, you may now consider me totally convinced. My ninth film from Wilder is among his very best, a sophisticated, sensitive and cynical comedy/drama/romance that satirises and critiques corporate big business and America's fading moral standards. Jack Lemmon, following the success of the director's previous film ∂?the hilarious cross-dressing farce 'Some Like It Hot (1959)' ∂? here proves his worth as a dramatic actor, bringing to the character of C. C. Baxter the charm and sincerity of an average, working-class American employee, trying to making an honest living from his powerless position as an office clerk at a large, impersonal insurance firm. In a society where power leads to corruption, Baxter finds his own steadfast morals beginning to slide, having agreed to loan out his apartment to higher-ranked business executives for the purposes of their underhanded extra-martial affairs. It is an act through which Baxter hopes to climb the corporate ladder, though he is simultaneously disgusted by the moral implications of his actions; lending out his apartment is the business equivalent of prostitution, and he recognises that he is merely being exploited in a manner than harms his moral integrity. 'The Apartment (1960)' was written by Billy Wilder and regular-collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, and is every bit as intelligent, witty and classy as the likes of 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' and 'Double Indemnity (1944).' Though certainly not as laugh-out-loud hilarious as 'Some Like It Hot,' the film dispenses comedy, romance and drama in such perfectly-portioned satchels that only a master could have helmed the production. Cinematographer Joseph LaShelle shot the film in crisp black-and-white, subduing the otherwise festive atmosphere of the Christmas-time setting and creating an air of bittersweet melancholy, the sort of sensation one feels when left alone with a joyful celebration ∂? its sounds muffled by the adjoining walls ∂? taking place in the next room. 'The Apartment' is also a meditation on loneliness. Though Baxter has developed an unearned reputation as something of a ""party animal"" {allowing for some amusing confrontations with his neighbour, Dr. Dreyfuss (Jack Kruschen)}, he is very much a solitary figure, disheartened by the general slackening of society's moral standards and left wondering why nice guys always finish last. Of course, I couldn't review 'The Apartment' without also mentioning the performances of Shirley MacLaine and Fred MacMurray, who help form the film's pivotal romantic triangle. MacLaine's Fran Kubelik, one of the building's elevator operators, is bright and independent in most respects, but has found herself romantically exploited by the insurance firm's director, Jeff D. Sheldrake (MacMurray), who has promised her a steady future but refuses to divorce his current wife. MacLaine brings a beautifully-balanced combination of intelligence and vulnerability to the role, at first appearing to be a carefree, upright young lady before slowly revealing vital flaws in her character. MacMurray, who I'd previously enjoyed as Walter Neff in Wilder's definitive film-noir, brings just the right amount of smug condescension to his interactions with Baxter, and his character's attempts at earnestness are immediately transparent as acts of unashamed manipulation. At the 1961 Academy Awards, voters were obviously impressed with the film's ability to tell a great story without the usual syrupy hijinks, and 'The Apartment' took away a deserved five Oscars, including Best Writing, Best Director and Best Picture ∂? the final black-and-white film to do so before Steven Spielberg's Holocaust epic, 'Schindler's List (1993).'  "
90626,tt0097576,ackstasis,australia,10,The quest for the Grail is not archeology; it's a race against evil.,"In 1981, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg astonished the cinema-going world with the brilliant rip-roaring adventure of 'Raiders of the Lost Ark,' featuring Harrison Ford as the rugged, handsome, whip-cracking archaeologist Indiana Jones. A phenomenal critical and box-office success, the film inevitably resulted in the production of sequels, which, happily, did not diminish greatly in quality. 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom' was released in 1986, to a rather more mixed reception, but the noticeably darker overtones and awe-inspiring effects-driven action sequences nonetheless make it one of cinema's supreme adventures. The third film in the series, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was released in 1989, partially as Spielberg's ""atonement"" for the perceived faults in his previous instalment. This one, superficially a rough retread of the original film, is my personal favourite of the lot, in no small part to Sean Connery's inspired casting as Professor Henry Jones. The story opens with a prologue from Indiana Jones' childhood, as a boy scout in Utah in 1912. After stumbling upon a group of grave robbers, young Indiana (played with gusto by River Phoenix, who tragically died of a drug overdose in 1993 at the brink of a successful career) steals the valuable Cross of Coronado, with the intention of presenting it to a museum. As he scrambles desperately across the carriages of a moving circus train, in flight from his experienced pursuers, we come to witness the origin of some of the hero's trademarks: the fear of snakes, the bull-whip and, of course, the fedora hat. Returning to 1938, we find Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) as the clean-shaven, tweed-wearing professor at a New England college, lecturing to his students about the lack of adventure in the field of archeology (""X never ever marks the spot""). Following the disappearance of his father, respected archaeologist Prof. Henry Jones (Sean Connery), Indiana strikes off across the world in search of him, unwittingly throwing himself into a race to discover the Holy Grail, the sacred cup used by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper. However, to make matters worse, Indiana finds that his old enemies ∂? the Nazis ∂? have also launched a frantic bid to acquire the Grail. Aided by museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and beautiful Austrian historian Elsa Schneider (Alison Doody), Indiana must rescue his father, beat the bad guys and uncover the ultimate archaeological treasure. 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' was, once again, directed by Steven Spielberg, working off a story by George Lucas and Menno Meyjes, and a screenplay from Jeffrey Boam. What ultimately makes the film such an enjoyable ride is its fantastic sense of humour, and Connery's character delivers a large portion of the comedy, whether he is smashing his son over the head with a fake Ming Vase, setting the floor alight or blasting away the tail of his own plane with a machine gun (before blaming it on the Nazis). Ford and Connery have their own share of playful father-son banter, which becomes particularly farcical when it is revealed that they have both slept with the same woman (a favourite piece of dialogue: ""I'm as human as the next man""; ""I was the next man!""). Denholm Elliott is also highly entertaining as Marcus Brody, who, despite Indiana's great respect for him, is so hopelessly inept that he ""once got lost in his own museum."" The film, just like its predecessors, is one long string of action sequences, the centrepiece in this one taking place on and around a heavily-armoured Nazi tank. Clever, witty and impeccably acted, 'Indiana Jones' was and remains one of the most entertaining motion pictures ever produced, and a flawless addition to an excellent trilogy. Bring on the fourth instalment!  "
92294,tt0042192,ackstasis,australia,8,It's about time the piano realised that it has not written the concerto,"I don't know what it was about 1950. Perhaps filmmakers had sufficiently recovered from the destruction of WWII to finally take stock of themselves, but it is in this year that Hollywood suddenly became self-aware; and it apparently didn't like what it saw. Billy Wilder's 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)' is cinema's most scathing satire of Hollywood's demented and destitute moral values. Likewise, Nicholas Ray's 'In a Lonely Place (1950)' demonstrates how the studio system snuffs out genuine talent through its intent upon ""selling popcorn."" But it was 'All About Eve (1950)' that truly took America by storm that year, uniting an ensemble of the industry's most charismatic stars and giving each of them acerbic mean streak that is both wonderfully compelling and entertaining. Though the film, scripted and directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz {who is also responsible for 'The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947)' and 'Sleuth (1972)'}, specifically concerns itself with the theatre, the parallels to Hollywood are unmistakable, and such is the screenplay's apparent distaste towards the film industry that I'm almost surprised of its success. On the brightly-lit stages of Broadway, respected but aging theatre star Margo Channing (Bette Davis) clings extravagantly to roles for which she is far too old; as though Mankiewicz and Billy Wilder were exchanging ideas, you can almost see her turning into Norma Desmond a few years down the track. One night, Margot is introduced to ostensibly her biggest fan, a meek and sincere young woman named Eve Harrington (Anne Baxter) ∂? now, remember that name! Had I known beforehand that Eve is considered one of American cinema's finest villains, the first half of the film would have severely confused me ∂? what detestable qualities could possibly be exhibited by this shy, modest and frankly adorable admirer of theatre? I decided that the mutual looks of contempt with which Margo and Karen (Celeste Holm) greet Eve's theatre award (a less-prestigious version of the Oscars) were merely the result of unfounded jealousy, and their resentment that such a modest girl could have received the high honour. When the penny finally dropped, oh, how I felt like a fool! Bette Davis, late in her career, was one of the few actresses with enough sheer charisma to persevere in Hollywood despite her relative lack of glamour or traditional beauty. In 'All About Eve,' her aging features look tired and almost grotesque ∂? I say this not derisively, but as an observation for how well Davis suits her character. Margo Channing could never have been played by an actress still completely at ease with her looks. In comparison, Anne Baxter illuminates every room, particularly after her selfish intentions are revealed to the audience. The moment of revelation, when she stands, still in costume, positively pulsating with ambition, desire and lust, is a shocking betrayal that really took me aback. The film uniquely emphasises female dominance, with the inconsequential, malleable husbands (Hugh Marlowe and Gary Merrill) frequently relegated to the sidelines. However, George Sanders, as the sharp-tongued columnist Addison DeWitt, holds such contemptuous views towards society that he recognises Eve's game from the very beginning, watches it with amused, admiring eyes, before promptly reasserting his male superiority over her in the final scenes.

95085,tt0040897,ackstasis,australia,10,I know what gold does to men's souls.,"John Huston's 1948 classic 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' is one of the most fascinating, thrilling and, above all, entertaining adventure films ever made. Huston teamed up with legendary Hollywood star Humphrey Bogart on six occasions, but never with more success than here, though one could certainly make a case for 'The Maltese Falcon (1941)' or 'The African Queen (1951).' The story concerns two young Americans in Mexico (Bogart and Tim Holt) who team up with wizened old gold-digger Howard (Walter Huston, the director's father) to strike it rich in the remote Sierra Madre Mountains. They do, indeed, strike it rich, but human greed leads the group to gradually turn against each other, inevitably leaving them with nothing. Though Bogart began his career playing the sleazy villain, he truly made his name as a cinematic hero, a proud and decent gentleman who we could cheer for. 'The Treasure of the Sierra Madre' marks an anomaly in Bogart's later work, as we witness the promise of more gold tear apart Fred C. Dobbs' steadfast morals, ultimately sealing his own demise. His transformation is truly unsettling to watch, as Dobbs breaks down into a paranoid, mumbling wreck of a man. After attempting to murder one of his comrades, he tries desperately to justify his actions to himself: ""Conscience. What a thing. If you believe you got a conscience it'll pester you to death. But if you don't believe you got one, what could it do t'ya?"" Regardless of how brilliant Bogart was, it's been argued that he was upstaged by Walter Huston as the tough and experienced old goldminer who's seen it all before. Huston Sr. won an Academy Award for his troubles, and, with his son winning both for Best Director and Best Screenplay, it was the only time in Oscar history that both father and son had won awards in the same year. Tim Holt, whose film appearances were generally limited to cowboy westerns, is also very good as Bob Curtin, the comrade whose loyalties are never swayed by the temptations of the gold. Also notable is Bruce Bennett as James Cody, a lone American who happens upon the site of the gold digging, and requests to be included in the venture. The film's screenplay, penned by John Huston, is loyally based on mysterious author B. Traven's 1927 novel of the same name. The film preserves much of the original story's dialogue, most notably by including the well-known (and often misquoted) ""stinking badges"" line, though the exact wording has been changed slightly. Whilst most film-goers erroneously exclaim ""we don't need no stinking badges!,"" the precise wording in the film goes as follows: ""Badges!? We ain't got no badges. We don't need no badges! I don't have to show you any stinking badges!"" The line itself is spoken by Mexican actor Alfonso Bedoya, who plays Gold Hat, a Mexican bandit leader. With 'The treasure of the Sierra Madre,' great writing, directing and acting wonderfully combine to create one of the most memorable cinematic experiences of the twentieth century. Filmed largely on location in Mexico ∂? almost unheard of at the time ∂? the film has an authentic sense of adventure about it, ensuring that Huston's masterpiece will be remembered for many years to come.

To date, I've seen three of his films {the other two being 'Double Indemnity (1944)' and 'Sunset Blvd. (1950)'}, and every single one absolutely brims with class, a triumph of witty writing and procificient direction. Even though 'Some Like It Hot (1959)' was voted #1 in the American Film Institute's '100 Years∂? 100 Laughs,' I didn't initially consider it the sort of film that I would enjoy. After all, who wants to watch a movie about men dressing up as women? Needless to say, I had completely underestimated the talent of both Wilder and his terrific cast, and 'Some Like It Hot' revealed itself to be a very funny film, indeed. Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon star as two jazz musicians who witness the Saint Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929 and are forced to flee Chicago posing as two members of an all-girls band. Comedic sparks fly when both men fall for sexy blonde vocalist ""Sugar Kane"" Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and, maintaining their female disguises, begin to fight for her affection. The most astonishing thing about 'Some Like It Hot' is that it never goes to where you expect it. The script, co-written by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond {from a story by Robert Thoeren and Michael Logan}, is basically a romantic screwball comedy, but with flourishes of the film-noir and gangster genres, most noticeable in the scenes featuring hardened mob-boss Spats Colombo (George Raft). Not many comedies open the proceedings with the brutal, cold-blooded murder of seven men, but Wilder's film does, and it's executed in such a way that, somehow, the unexpected scenes of violence never seem out of place. At the very least, these sinister events provide the perfect incentive for Curtis and Lemmon to throw on a dress, a wig and some make-up, their facade wholly believable in the face of such an unpleasant alternative. Wilder filmed 'Some Like It Hot' in black-and-white, not only to evoke the appopriate time-period, but, more importantly, to obscure the unavoidable imperfections in the men's make-up. Though the end result isn't very convincing at all ∂? as a male, I certainly wouldn't make the mistake of approaching either Josephine or Daphne ∂? it requires a suspension of disbelief that we're more-than-willing to make. The comedic duo of Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon works extremely well. Curtis tends to appear rather self-conscious posing as a woman, finding more comfort as the multi-millionaire heir to Shell Oil, as whom to poses to win over Sugar Kane. On the other hand, Lemmon is entirely uninhibited as Daphne, exploding into feverish episodes of feminine behaviour that lead us to believe that perhaps his performance as a woman has convinced even himself. While Curtis' Joe (a.k.a. Josephine) spends his time attempting to woo Marilyn Monroe (whose character, self-described as being not particularly bright, absolutely oozes sexuality), Lemmon's Jerry (a.k.a. Daphne) finds that he has larger problems, as an obsessed old millionaire, Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown), falls in love with him. Keeping the entertainment level as high as possible at all times, Wilder thankfully denies us the seemingly-inevitable, clich«∏d moral lesson that usually arises once the supporting characters discover the true identity of their girlfriends. Most legendary of all is the reaction of Osgood Fielding, in the film's final line, as Jerry admits that he is merely a man posing as a woman: ""Well, nobody's perfect.""  "
96434,tt0041959,ackstasis,australia,10,The world doesn't make any heroes outside of your stories.,"They call it film noir. But to do so would imply that the film adheres closely to the stylistic and thematic rules of its predecessors, when, put simply, there's never been anything quite like 'The Third Man (1949).' Carol Reed's post-War masterpiece differs from traditional noir in that it is a distinctly British production, equipped with a wry, almost whimsical, sense of humour that places it alongside the Ealing films of the era, particularly 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949)' and 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951).' Set in post-WWII Vienna, the film depicts a crumbling community of wretched thieves and black-market racketeers, effectively capturing the decadence and corruption of a city that has been brought to its knees. Instantly recognisable through Robert Krasker's harsh lighting and oblique, distorted cinematography, as well as Anton Karas' unique and unforgettable soundtrack ∂? performed on a peculiar musical instrument called a zither ∂? 'The Third Man' is one of the most invigorating cinema experiences to which one may be treated. Into the rubble-strewn ruins of Vienna comes an American pulp-novelist, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), who arrives without a dime in his pocket in search of an old friend named Harry Lime. However, upon his arrival, Martins is horrified to learn of Lime's tragic death in a traffic accident. Unsatisfied with the explanations he receives from the authorities and witnesses, he teams up with Lime's ex-girlfriend Anna Schmidt (Aldi Valli) to solve the mystery of his best friend's death. Was it an accident? Was it murder? Who was the ""third man"" who was seen carrying Lime to the roadside? Of course, as you and I both know, Martins' childhood friend, having faked his own death, is very much alive, and intent on keeping his continued existence quiet. The extraordinary moment, when Harry Lime's face is abruptly illuminated in a doorway, as a cat affectionately nuzzles his shoes, hardly comes as a surprise after fifty years, but the magic is very much still there. Orson Welles' amused boyish smirk, wryly taunting Martins across the roadway, signals the entrance of one of cinema's most charismatic supporting characters. Despite being absent for the first half, Lime's presence is felt throughout, his darkened shadow continually towering over Martins as he seeks to ascertain the circumstances of his friend's death. Lime is a perfect example of the anti-hero, a vibrant, likable and identifiable personality who commits atrocities that should immediately warrant our detestation. Graham Greene's brisk and intelligent screenplay gives Lime all the best lines, particularly on the Ferris Wheel ride when he muses on the value of those inconsequential ""little dots"" walking below, though Welles himself takes credit for penning the celebrated ""cuckoo clock"" monologue; a rapidly-delivered acknowledgment of the creativity born from ""warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed."" Though Welles justifiably receives a lot of the praise, every other cast member delivers a wonderful performance, particularly Cotten as the bemused and morally-conflicted foreigner, Valli as Lime's steadfast lifelong disciple, and Trevor Howard as the Major who wishes that Lime had remained underground. Director Carol Reed famously clashed with producer David O. Selznick over various facets of the film's production, with Selznick insisting on pivotal casting decisions, and allegedly suggesting that the film be titled ""Night Time in Vienna."" However, in the case of the suitably downbeat ending, both producer and director saw eye-to-eye, and Greene's original optimistic conclusion (in which Holly and Anna reconcile) was shelved in favour of the wonderful static long-shot, in which Martins is completely ignored by the women whose trust he is perceived to have broken. 'The Third Man,' perhaps as a result of these contradictory artistic influences, has acquired, like no other film I've seen, a distinct personality of its own. Karas' zither soundtrack, as though consciously flouting traditional noir conventions, adds an element of whimsy to the proceedings, and somehow complements perfectly the larger-than-life distortion of Krasker's photography, in which ordinary human shadows tower three storeys in height, and even the most commonplace of interactions take on the warped dimensions of a drug-induced dream. In Vienna, the truth can be as elusive as a ghost.  "
97414,tt0081398,ackstasis,australia,8,Deserving Of Its Classic Status,"After hearing about the brilliance of 'Raging Bull' for months and months, I was delighted when I managed to find a copy of the film. Whilst I must honestly say that I didn't enjoy the film as much as many others before me, I can certainly see why it is considered a masterpiece. First of all, the acting is absolutely flawless. Robert De Niro, in perhaps his greatest role (I'm still deciding between this and 'Taxi Driver'), stunningly portrays Jake LaMotta, a vicious and talented fighter but a paranoid husband. De Niro earned himself an Oscar for this performance, and it is easy to see why. The scene where LaMotta is thrown into a jail cell for selling alcohol to minors- overweight, disliked and alone- is one of the great acting scenes of all time. The supporting performances are also very notable, especially Joe Pesci (Casino, 1995) as LaMotta's brother and agent, and Cathy Moriarty as LaMotta's husband. The boxing scenes, though unexpectedly scarce throughout the film, are moments of utter beauty, and a testament to outstanding direction, editing and cinematography. The viewer is cast within the boxing ring, and they flinch with every blow, as if struck themselves. In watching this film, it is essential to first understand that this is not supposed to be a ""boxing film."" In other words, you won't be getting an inspirational, underdog film like 'Rocky.' 'Raging Bull' is a biographical character study of Jake LaMotta and a classical examination of masculinity. I must admit that I felt the film was a bit slow in some places, and had a drawn-out, anti-climactic ending, but I think that's merely because I was in a 'Rocky' sort of mood. With every scene, I found myself yearning for another of those brilliant boxing scenes, and I was slightly disappointed when we find LaMotta overweight and lazy - a sure sign that his boxing days were now over... I've heard that 'Raging Bull' is a film that benefits substantially from a second viewing. With my expectations of another 'Rocky' put aside, I think I can appreciate this film a lot more, something that it certainly deserves. So this is what I'll do: I'll give it a few weeks, and then I'll try the film again. You'll be hearing from me soon!  "

You do what you do best, try to stop guys like me","Like him or not, director Michael Mann has his own distinctive style, but what matters is how well he is able to use it to tell a story. 'Manhunter (1986),' a solid and well-acted thriller, was tarnished by Mann's excessively ""trendy"" style, and a musical soundtrack that has kept the film perpetually trapped in the 1980s. More recently, 'Collateral (2004)' demonstrated a precise and balanced combination of style and substance, making excellent use of the digital Viper FilmStream Camera, perfect for capturing the low-key lighting of Mann's favoured night-time urban landscape. His follow-up, 'Miami Vice (2006),' was almost entirely devoid of substance, a meandering crime story redeemed only by a thrilling shoot-out in the final act. 'Heat (1995)' is among Mann's most lauded achievements, and I'm happy to say that it's probably the finest of the director's films I've seen so far. Most noted for being the first film in which Al Pacino and Robert De Niro shared the same screen (they were separated by decades in Coppola's 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'), 'Heat' is sizzling, action-packed drama. Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) is something of a clich«∏, the hard-working homicide detective who is distant from his family. However, Pacino gives the character depth, a hard-edged, street-wise cop who is basically good at heart. When writing dialogue for Al Pacino, the temptation is always there to make him shout a lot, and there are several scenes when Mann does exactly that, but the character is strongest when he's not talking at all, lost in silent contemplation or embracing the hysterical mother of a murder victim. Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) sits on the opposite side of the law, a principled professional thief who has dedicated his entire life to crime. McCauley has a motto: ""don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."" His failure to adhere to this advice is ultimately what gets him killed, for, though he is prepared to discard his relationship with a sincere art designer (Amy Brenneman), McCauley unable to walk away from his own principles. 'Heat' boasts an impressive supporting cast ∂? including Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Dennis Haysbert and Jon Voight ∂? but it's no surprise that Pacino and De Niro dominate the film. Their single face-to-face encounter is a corker, as they sit opposite each other sipping coffee (the table between them representing not only the border between police and criminal, but also a mirror of sorts). Hanna and McCauley exchange terse pleasantries like old friends, despite having never met before, and the two master actors coolly and effortlessly exude charisma with every word. The film's promotional tagline boasts ""a Los Angeles crime saga,"" suggesting that Mann was attempting something akin to his own 'The Godfather (1972),' though he doesn't quite pull it off as readily as Coppola. His film could have done with a few trimmings, excising a few largely superfluous personal subplots, including an impromptu suicide attempt that came right out of left-field. Nevertheless, 'Heat' is a gripping crime story, with great performances, and one of the best shootouts that you'll see anywhere.  "
99269,tt0071315,ackstasis,australia,8,"You've got a nasty reputation, Mr. Gittes. I like that.","Upon its release, Roman Polanski's 'Chinatown' was a critical success, and was lauded as one of the greatest neo-noirs of its time. Furthermore, over thirty years later, the film remains standing as one of the few post-1960 productions that can credibly be compared with the likes of 'Double Indemnity' and 'The Maltese Falcon.' Jake 'J.J' Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is a Los Angeles cop turned private investigator, who specialises in spying on and photographing cheating partners. Gittes is hired by a woman named Evelyn Mulwray to investigate her cheating husband, Hollis Mulwray, the chief engineer for the city's water department. However, shortly after, Mr. Mulwray is found murdered in the reservoir, and the supposed Mrs. Mulwray turns out to be an impostor. Nevertheless, we know that the real Evelyn Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) is tied into this mystery somewhere; how simply remains a matter of time. Polanski beautifully evokes the time and place of 1930s Los Angeles, never straying too far from that iconic film-noir style. Despite being filmed in colour, we are always reminded of the film's roots, complemented by Richard Sylbert's wonderful production design and W. Stewart Campbell's art direction. Missing, also, is the Jake Gittes narration outlined in the original script ∂? this typical noir component was, no doubt, simply excluded for its redundancy. Through Nicholson's terrific acting, we already know what Gittes is thinking; we don't need to be told again. Furthermore, by not including narration, we only learn the newest developments in the crime as Gittes does, heightening the suspense and uncertainty of the ultimate outcome. Technically, the film is near flawless. John A. Alonzo's cinematography is stellar, as is the shadowy original score from the always-reliable Jerry Goldsmith. The acting is also top-notch, with Jack Nicholson notably receiving most of the acclaim, and picking up his fourth unsuccessful Oscar nomination for Best Actor (he would eventually win the following year for 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'). The supporting cast, however, is equally good, with Faye Dunaway brilliant as Evelyn Mulwray, legendary film director John Huston great as her wealthy, scheming villainous father and an enjoyably memorable cameo from Polanski himself as the knife-wielding thug who slices Gittes' nose. The shocking and tragically downbeat ending to the film certainly came as a surprise to me, though it probably wouldn't have to devoted fans of the film-noir genre. It is he with the money and power that ultimately emerges triumphant, we are told. When Evelyn is trying to escape her father, brandishing a weapon in his direction, Jake warns her to ""let the police handle this."" ""He owns the police!"" she replies, before desperately shooting her father in the arm. Just seconds later she is shot down by police. Jake is led away from the scene, all too aware that it was his actions that led directly to this outcome. However, he is now powerless to do anything. The rich and the powerful have, and will continue to, get their way. Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.  "
100527,tt0457430,ackstasis,australia,9,My mother told me to be wary of Fauns.,"The success of Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings (2001-2003)' and Tim Burton's 'Big Fish (2003)' demonstrated that adult audiences still enjoy stepping into the magical and wonderful worlds that captivated them throughout their childhoods. Mexican director Guillermo del Toro has made fantasy his speciality, having achieved critical success in the past with such films as 'The Devil's Backbone (2001)' and mainstream comic-book adaptation 'Hellboy (2004).' Though I had previously never seen any of his films, I now consider del Toro to be a director-to-watch, since his most recent release, 'El Laberinto del fauno / Pan's Labyrinth' is one of the favourite films of 2006, second only to fellow Mexican director Alfonso Cuar«¸n's dystopic futuristic sci-fi, 'Children of Men (2006).' An ""adult fantasy"" in every sense of the word, 'Pan's Labyrinth' unfurls a marvellous fantasy fairytale amid the bloody backdrop of the aftermath of Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). A young girl learns to endure the violence and devastation of warfare by retreating into a world of fantasy, occupied by fairies, fauns and other similarly-wondrous and terrifying creatures. Young Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) is an intelligent and imaginative girl with a fondness for fairy tales. After the death of her father, a simple tailor, Ofelia's mother, Carmen (Ariadna Gil), marries an ambitious and sadistic Falange commander, Captain Vidal (Sergi L«¸pez), who has been assigned to an old homestead from which to root out the remaining Marxist guerrillas. Vidal is ruthless in his attempts to exterminate the sympathetic rebels, often employing torture and intense violence to achieve his objectives. His primary ambition in life is to be remembered as a brave soldier, and, like his father, he wishes to die in battle so that his own son {currently developing in the womb of Ofelia's heavily-pregnant mother} will know the exact moment of his death and will be proud of him. With her mother seriously ill in bed, Ofelia is generally neglected by the household, with the exception of a kind-hearted servant (Maribel Verd«ß) whose sympathies lie with the rebels. In order to escape the horrors of the ongoing conflict, Ofelia devises an elaborate fantasy-world in which she is the returned spirit of Princess Moanna, destined to return to her glorious underground kingdom. Whether Ofelia's fantasies are, indeed, authentic or not {I tend to believe that the creatures are figments of her imagination, stemming from a subconscious desire to escape the violence of the real world}, there's no doubting the magnificence of del Toro's creations. Intricate make-up, puppetry and computer-generated imagery combine to create an assortment of the most mesmerising fantasy creatures I've ever seen: Doug Jones' Faun {named as the Greek god Pan in the English-translated title, though del Toro has denounced this due to the possible sexual connotations} is absolutely spellbinding in his every single word and movement, and one need only compare him to the rather ordinary faun in Adam Adamson's 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)' to confirm the superiority of del Toro's artistic vision. 'Pan's Labyrinth' brilliantly blurs the borders of the story's real and fantasy worlds, and young Ivana Baquera delivers an assured and mature performance in the leading role, lending credibility to her character's interactions with each fantastic creature. Guillermo del Toro's picture proved successful at the 2007 Oscars, winning awards for Art Direction, Cinematography and Make-up from six nominations.  "
102300,tt0050212,ackstasis,australia,9,Do not speak to me of rules. This is war! This is not a game of cricket!,"Nobody could craft an epic film better than David Lean, as I learned earlier this year when I watched the magnificent 'Lawrence of Arabia' for the first time. Though he had achieved earlier success with such films as 'Brief Encounter (1945)' and 'Great Expectations (1946),' 'The Bridge on the River Kwai' was the first of Lean's multi-million dollar wide-screen spectaculars, for which he is now most fondly remembered. Shot on location in the jungles of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), the film concerns the building of a railway bridge by Allied prisoners-of-war during World War Two. As it becomes less and less likely that the bridge will be constructed before the deadline, conflict escalates between the proud British leader, Col. Nicholson (Alec Guinness) and hot-tempered Col. Saito (Sessue Hayakawa). The film proved very successful at the 1958 Oscars, taking home seven awards (including Best Picture) from eight nominations. Whilst William Holden's cynical, hard-edged American was likely considered the main star attraction, the film's most memorable character ∂? and, indeed, one of the greatest in cinema history ∂? is Alec Guiness' Col. Nicholson. The embodiment of British courage and dedication, Nicholson finds himself in a battle of wills with the ruthless Col. Saito, who, despite representing the enemy, nonetheless exhibits many of the same qualities: egotistical pride, obstinacy and unwillingness to compromise. For Col. Nicholson, the construction of the railway bridge becomes something of an obsession, its completion symbolic of ""Western methods and efficiency that will put {the Japanese} to shame"" and the culmination of his 28 years in the military. When he uncovers the plot to destroy the bridge, Nicholson betrays his fellow countrymen to the Japanese, his narcissistic pride in the landmark prompting him to neglect his sworn duty to Britain. I'd like to take some time to consider the film's climax, undoubtedly one of the most awe-inspiring cinema spectacles of all time. I had initially anticipated that, after the intricate task of planting the explosives overnight, the detonation of the bridge would be a rather straightforward task. However, David Lean weaves so much action and suspense into the finale that the closing credits left me reeling. As the distant rumble of a train announces its impending arrival, Col. Nicholson notices that the reduction in river-level has exposed the wires connecting the explosives to the detonator. Not yet comprehending the situation, he summons Col. Saito and they both descend to the riverside to investigate. Once his fears are confirmed, Nicholson ∂? to his subsequent dismay ∂? attempts to thwart his army's attempt to destroy the enemy bridge, and both Lt. Joyce (Geoffrey Horne) and Cmdr. Shears (William Holden) are fatally shot. Interestingly, there have been suggestions that Maj. Warden (Jack Hawkins) fired the lethal shots at his own comrades, abandoning the mission objective in an attempt to prevent their live capture by the merciless Japanese. Whilst this isn't explicitly shown in the film itself, it reportedly corresponds with Pierre Boulle's original novel (in which, notably, the bridge is not destroyed) and would certainly explain why, afterwards, Warden tries to rationalise his actions: ""I had to do it. I had to do it. They might have been captured alive. It was the only thing to do."" Alternatively, Warden didn't shoot them, but is attempting to justify his use of the mortars, which basically obliterated any slim remaining chances on their survival. Meanwhile, Nicholson, struck by shrapnel from a mortar attack, crumbles hopelessly onto the detonator (either intentionally or inadvertently) just as the train begins to cross the river. The actual collapse of the $250,000 bridge, a shot which owes a lot to Buster Keaton and 'The General (1927)', is an amazing spectacle, and Maj. Clipton (James Donald) sums up the entire climax - and war in general - with his horrified exclamation of ""Madness! Madness!""  "

Here are just a few words that can be used to describe Frank Capra's brilliant 1939 film, 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' Bringing together a stellar cast of both fresh and seasoned actors, Capra manages to reach into each of our chests, and wrench almost painfully at our heartstrings. Jefferson Smith (James Stewart, 'It's A Wonderful Life'), is a young, enthusiastic patriot who resides in an unnamed American state, but is known throughout it (most especially by the young boys of the region) as an unsung hero. Head of the Boy Rangers, Smith has a love of his country and of nature, once quenching a potentially devastating forest fire single-handedly. After the unexpected death of a current Senator, Governor Hubert Hopper (Guy Kibbee) is forced to choose a replacement. Whilst his corrupt political boss, Jim Taylor (Edward Arnold), urges him to appoint a handpicked stooge, Hopper surprisingly decides to follow the confident advice of his own children, awarding the job to Smith. Smith arrives in Washington, excited and idealistic, no doubt modestly considering himself to be unsuitable for such a prestigious position. He is proud to accompany the other current state Senator, Joseph Harrison Paine (Claude Rains, 'Notorious'), a highly-esteemed man who was once great friends with Smith's father. Unbeknownst to Smith, however, Paine had long ago abandoned his political ideals, seduced by the promise of power and political longevity to make ""certain compromises."" Whilst Smith works tirelessly to submit a bill regarding the creation of a national boy's camp at Willet Creek, which he hopes will teach a new generation the value of freedom and liberty, the devious Paine schemes to dam that same locality, an act that will serve nobody but the power-hungry Jim Taylor. When Paine's cynical secretary, Clarissa Saunders (Jean Arthur), informs Smith of these plans, he determinedly attempts to speak his mind, only to be quashed by the almighty ""Taylor Machine."" Frank Capra, who had previously supplied Columbia Pictures Corporation with two Academy Award Best Picture winners ('It Happened One Night,' 1934 and 'You Can't Take It With You,' 1938), once again proved his undeniable genius, something he would continue to do throughout his film-making career. One often-cited example involves the romantically-awkward Smith's second encounter with Paine's beautiful daughter, Susan (Astrid Allwyn). Rather than focusing on faces, as would be the typical style for such a scene, Capra keeps the camera firmly on Smith's hat, as he restlessly shuffles it between his fingers, frequently dropping it to the floor and stooping to reclaim it. This shot tells us more about Smith than any facial close-up ever could! Finally, James Stewart is unquestionably brilliant as the young, idealistic Smith, in one of his first critically recognised roles. The look of absolute awe and wonderment on his face upon first witnessing the Capitol Dome appears truly genuine, despite the fact that Stewart was merely acting against a projection. For his highly memorable filibuster speech at the climax of the film, Stewart dried out his throat with bicarbonate of soda to make himself sound hoarse, an act that could potentially have destroyed his later ability to speak. As we witness Jefferson Smith, ragged and exhausted, determinedly continuing to shout hoarsely at the Senate members, we immediately understand that his voice is reaching much, much further. He is not just shouting at the Senate, but he is shouting at the people; he is shouting at his country; he is shouting at us. And we are right there alongside him, quietly urging him along.  "

He stands upon a rocky beach shore ∂? tall, proud, inescapable ∂? his gaunt face staring expectantly towards his next victim. War-weathered knight Antonius Block (Max von Sydow, ""The Exorcist"") is not surprised to see him. The Black Death has already descended upon Sweden, killing all in its path, inciting terror in every village. ""I have long walked at your side,"" proclaims Death. ""That I know,"" is Block's reply. He understands that his time has now come, but he fears death. He cannot undertake what he does not understand. Is there a God? Following death, will he experience the rewards of Heaven, or the vast emptiness of nothing. Block likens faith in God to ""loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call."" His faith is lost; he cannot move on until he has decided upon his beliefs. Desperate for several more days to come to terms with his faith, Block challenges Death (Bengt Ekerot) to a game of chess. His opponent is actually quite a skillful chess player, but the knight hopes to be able to hold him off for long enough to acquire the ""knowledge"" that he so desires. And so Block, accompanied by his brave and loyal squire J«Ùns (Gunnar Bj«Ùrnstrand), strikes off to see his wife just one final time, each day bringing him several moves closer to the end. Meanwhile, a small travelling troop of actors, comprising playfully-natured Jof (Nils Poppe), his wife Mia (Bibi Andersson), their one-year-old son Mikael and partner Skat (Erik Strandmark), try to make ends meet through their theatrical performances. The paths of these two parties will eventually meet, and all those who travel alongside Antonius Block will risk suffering the same fate as he, should the fateful chess game prove unsuccessful. This being my first film from Ingmar Bergman, I was immediately astonished at how beautiful the film was. Whether it be the unforgettable close-ups of Death's ghostly white face and captivating gaze, two horses drinking solemnly from the ocean's edge, the ghastly procession of bloodied penitents who haul hefty wooden crosses and sacrificially flog themselves or the distant image of Death leading his followers in a Danse Macabre (Dance of Death) across a grassy mountain-top, 'The Seventh Seal' is brimming with beauty. The acting is absolutely stunning. Max von Sydow, the only name I recognised due to his significant later work in such films as Friedkin's 'The Exorcist (1973)' and Spielberg's 'Minority Report (2002),' is superb as Antonius Block, the knight who must decide who or what he believes in before his time runs out. Of the many representations of Death in cinema, Bengt Ekerot's portrayal in this film must be one of the finest ∂? with his icy black stare, his arrogant and merciless manner and all sorts of devious trickery up his sleeves, 'The Seventh Seal's' Death has to be one of the most memorable villains of all time. Though not subtle in its symbolism by any standards, this directness is one of the film's strengths. By regarding good and evil with the same physical simplicity as its hero does, we are forced to make up our minds either way. Stunningly beautiful, endlessly thought-provoking, chilling and mesmerising, Ingmar Bergman's 'The Seventh Seal' is a masterpiece of existential cinema.  "
105101,tt0055031,ackstasis,australia,7,Once more it is being done for love of country,"Stanley Kramer was more active as a producer rather than a director, but, when he stood for something, he would often take up the reigns himself. Kramer made no apologies for producing ""message films,"" and, though his transparent motives have the potential to age poorly, there's no doubt that he had the stature to approach controversial issues ∂? such as racism {'The Defiant Ones (1958)'}, religion {'Inherit the Wind (1960)'} and the Holocaust ∂? with confidence and dignity. 'Judgement at Nuremberg (1961)' wears its pretensions on its sleeve, a film so utterly convinced of its own importance that Kramer must surely have already known about the eleven Oscar nominations before he opened production. Fortunately, much of this self-importance is quite justified. The epic 186-minute courtroom drama tackles some of the fundamental issues in the aftermath of WWII, such as the accountability of higher citizens for the Holocaust and how patriotism has the ability to corrupt human morals. With a mighty cast of Hollywood stars, Kramer impartially dissects the Nuremberg trials, exposing tragedy and hypocrisy. Courtroom dramas have remained such audience favourites because they are a showcase for emotional outbursts and impassioned monologues. 'Judgement at Nuremberg,' in keeping with the tone of its subject matter, is largely gloomy and subdued, only occasionally reaching the thrilling highs of Sidney Lumet's '12 Angry Men (1957),' Robert Mulligan's 'To Kill a Mockingbird (1962)' or Kramer's own 'Inherit the Wind (1960).' Any speech by Maximilian Schell {who won the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role, despite being billed fifth} keeps you fixated on the screen, and, likewise, Burt Lancaster's confession and Montgomery Clift's interrogation are must-see moments. The remainder of the film occasionally falls in stagnation, perhaps an inevitable consequence of its format and length, though the drama remains quite watchable, even if I wouldn't fancy a re-viewing until several years from now. The performances are impressive across the board, though Judy Garland, who somehow still retains the rosy cheeks of her childhood, seems terribly out-of-place in such a grim drama. When he isn't in court, American Chief Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) experiences the post-war German lifestyle, as its defeated citizens attempt to reconstruct their shattered lives amid the humiliation of being branded ""evil"" by the rest of the world. Screenwriter Abby Mann has it both ways on this issue: on the one hand, he represents the ordinary German civilians as proud and resourceful people, who could never have known the true extent of Hitler's regime. However, Judge Haywood later lambasts this perception, asserting that this argument is merely a self-made delusion, and that their inaction ∂? and, indeed, the inaction of the whole world ∂? was just as contemptible as the acts of those who physically committed the atrocities of the Holocaust. In stating what he believes to be the truth, Haywood invokes the ire of the American government, and severs his close friendship with Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), whose husband was executed for his leadership of the German Army. The truth, it seems, was not something that most people wanted to hear, but Stanley Kramer said it, and we listened.  "
105313,tt0050986,ackstasis,australia,8,I have a habit of recalling scenes from childhood to calm me. So it was this evening.,"'Wild Strawberries' was my second film from Swedish master director Ingmar Bergman, and it couldn't have come at a more appropriate time, just one month after the director's death, age 89. After 'The Seventh Seal' left me in absolute awe of its flawless beauty, 'Wild Strawberries,' released in the same year, did little to disappoint. Each and every frame is utterly perfect, and Bergman's hand so incredibly assured. Even in the most common situations ∂? a close-up of Dr. Isak Borg's face, for example ∂? the images on the screen seem to exude beauty; we see the character's aging, withered features and a sense of irreconcilable sadness lurking behind his eyes, and we, too, are crestfallen. 'Wild Strawberries' stars Victor Sj«Ùstr«Ùm, then 78, as Dr. Isak Borg, an aging professor who travels across the country from Stockholm to Lund to receive an honorary university degree. Sj«Ùstr«Ùm himself was one of Sweden's greatest directors, no doubt a great influence upon Bergman, and he also directed 'K«Ùrkarlen {The Phantom Chariot} (1921),' among my favourite films of the silent era. As he makes the day-long car journey, Isak begins to re-evaluate his entire life, prompted by memories, daydreams and unsettling nightmares. His wife has passed away some years ago, the end to a somewhat frictional marriage, and now Isak is fully aware that his own minutes are slowly ticking away. In the truly frightening opening dream sequence, he finds himself in a deserted city, with an ominous blackness looming ominously over his lonely form, and the complete and utter silence leaving him only too aware of the frantic beating of his failing heart. Approaching a coffin that has toppled from a carriage into the street, Isak finds within it his own expressionless corpse. Accompanying Isak on his journey to Lund is his daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), who is currently facing marital problems with her husband and possesses a certain bitterness towards his father. The marriage between Marianne and Evald (Gunnar Bj«Ùrnstrand) is very much like that between Isak and his long-deceased wife, and one of Isak's final wishes is that he can convince his son not to make the very same mistakes that he did. Also along for the trip is young hitchhiker Sara (Bibi Andersson), who reminds Isak of his lost childhood love, and her two friends Anders and Viktor, who both love her. A bickering married couple whom they pick up after a car accident (played by Gunnel Brostr«Ùm and Gunnar Sj«Ùberg) act as a cold reminder of Isak's many unhappy years with his wife, Karin (Gertrud Fridh). Considering the solemn subject matter, Bergman includes quite a few amusing moments in his film, many arising from Anders and Victor's childlike bickering over the existence of God. There is a genuine air of optimism infused throughout the story, and the ending ∂? though I thought it came all too soon ∂? is both gratifying and heartwarming. 'Wild Strawberries' is a beautiful tale of life, death and redemption, and nobody tells it more beautifully than Ingmar Bergman.  "
105395,tt0017925,ackstasis,australia,8,If you lose this war don't blame me.,"It was an early Saturday afternoon, and I was searching about for a light-hearted comedic adventure film to keep me amused until dinner was ready. My eyes suddenly fell upon 'The General,' starring the inimitable Buster Keaton, and released in 1927. I had never seen it before, but ∂? having greatly enjoyed the absolutely hilarious 'Sherlock Jr.' of three years earlier ∂? I was more than willing to give it a shot. On its initial release, 'The General' was a mammoth box office flop, by and large disparaged by the critics, though time has been kind to the film. Today, it is rightly considered a comedy masterpiece, and is often the first stepping-stone for newcomers to discover the treasure-trove of silent comedic classics released by ""The Great Stone Face."" Johnny Gray is Keaton's usual glum-faced character, a young man with courage, bravery and a thirst to prove himself, but ultimately without the means to do so. First in line to join the American Civil War to fight the Union, Johnny is turned away at the enlisting office due to his importance as a railway engineer, and he suffers the shame of not being able to fight with his fellow countrymen. Aside from his engine, The General ∂? a type 4-4-0 steam locomotive ∂? Johnny has but one love, Annabelle Lee (Marion Mack). However, when she is wrongly told that Johnny never even stood in line to enlist, she believes him to be a coward, and refuses to be with him until he is in uniform. One year on, Johnny finally stumbles upon a means to prove himself, when Union Army spies (headed by prolific silent film actor Glen Cavender) hijack his beloved General, and Annabelle finds herself a prisoner at the mercy of a group of cunning and unpredictable soldiers. Determined to recover what he loves, Johnny single-handedly gives chase, acquiring another locomotive, The Texas, to assist in the cross-country chase, which is based on true events. Facing setbacks at every turn in the railway, Johnny must use every inch of intellect he possesses in order to outwit his adversaries, rescue his loved ones (both the General and Annabelle) and save the day for the Confederacy. Technically, 'The General' is a cinematic marvel. A considerable portion of the movie was filmed on an actual moving train (you'll find no miniature plastic models here), and the actors ∂? especially Buster Keaton ∂? do a remarkable job of completing their performances with the additional burden of wind, motion and the potentially fatal consequences of a single misstep. As in all his films, Keaton's dedication to the medium is instantly apparent, with his character completing a wide assortment of hair-raising stunts, including jumping from the engine to a tender to a boxcar, sitting on the cow-catcher of the slow moving train while holding a railroad tie, and running along the roof. The final climactic crash of the locomotive, in which a bridge crumbles as the Texas attempts to cross it, was the single most ambitious and expensive scene of the silent era. The laughs come thick and fast, with Johnny persevering forwards despite any number of obstacles that may come his way. The film does slow down a bit during its centre portion, namely because there is temporarily not a train in sight, but, once Johnny manages to reclaim his General, things get exciting again. The second half of the film is a complete reversal of the first, with Johnny now at the helm of the locomotive being chased. Some absurdly-dangerous stunt work, and some high-speed railway thrills, makes this ride a highly entertaining one. 'The General' is currently sitting in the public domain. This is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows practically anybody to access a copy of the film, whether it be on DVD or the internet, increasing public awareness of Keaton's films and perhaps even inspiring an interest in the silent classics that are too often neglected. On the other hand, being in the public demand means that any distributor can digitize a poor-quality print and sell it as 'The General' to make a few quick dollars. The version I uncovered was decent enough, but the soundtrack was a rather random assortment of classical music, which was passable but not ideal. Needless to say, if I were to ever encounter a high-quality print of the film, I would have absolutely no hesitation in purchasing it.  "

I found myself simply unable to drag my eyes from the screen, but I wouldn't want to, anyway. The character of John Merrick (based on the real-life ""Elephant Man"" Joseph Carey Merrick), whilst initially repulsive to the eye, has an aura of beauty about him. The sheer courage of this man - in the face of unimaginable discrimination and adversity - left me in constant awe, and the moment when the hideous ""imbecile"" is revealed to be an intelligent and sensitive being is truly a memorable moment. The acting is simply superb. Anthony Hopkins, who would rise to fame a decade later in the chilling 'The Silence of the Lambs,' is brilliant as Frederick Treves, a doctor who initially exploits Merrick's condition to advance his career, but inevitably falls in love with the man. Likewise, John Hurt is so perfect as John ""The Elephant Man"" Merrick that I feel I don't even need to express how good he was! The famous scene in which Merrick, unfairly cornered at a train station by a mob of angry men, desperately cries ""I am not an animal! I am a human being! I...am...a man!"" is one of the great moments in cinema. I would consider this film to be absolutely perfect, but for the very end. As Merrick lays himself down on the bed, determined to sleep and die as a normal man, I would have been blissfully content with a brief pan to his mother's photograph, a pause of several seconds and a soft fade into black. However, we instead have the stars in the sky flying past the camera and, as I interpreted it, the spirit of Merrick's beautiful mother offering him comfort in his final moments. Perhaps I am missing the significance of this final scene, but I simply felt it was unnecessary. We shouldn't let this minor nitpick detract too much from the brilliance of the film. Afterall, it is not often that I am so completely captivated by a film. Not since 'Apocalypse Now' (a completely different film, I realise) have I been left in such awe as the credits begin to roll. Of course, considerable credit should be given to David Lynch. 'The Elephant Man,' his second film, is my first exploration into the films of Lynch, and it certainly will not be the last!  "

Upon losing a game of Go to a fellow student, Nash tries desperately to figure out what went wrong, recalling ""I had the first move, my play was perfect,"" before declaring that ""the game is flawed.""

Afterall, if it is his mind itself that is the problem, how could he possibly use his own impeccable logic to solve it? Most likely, Nash decides, it is everybody else who must be wrong. Despite winning the 2000 Best Actor Oscar for ""Gladiator,"" it is in this film that Russell Crowe delivers his greatest performance, announcing unquestionably to the world that he is one of the most gifted talents of his generation. Contrasting starkly with his previous character, Maximus Decimus Meridius, John Nash is shy and softly-spoken, often exhibiting a complete disregard for social conventions. With his first spoken lines, Nash insults a man's choice of necktie, before informing another fellow student that ""there's not one seminal or innovative idea"" in either of his pre-prints. Unaware on how to communicate with women, Nash sometimes matter-of-factly declares to an interested female, ""I don't exactly know what I am required to say in order for you to have intercourse with me. But could we assume that I said all that,"" before requesting that they cut straight to the ""fluid exchange."" This statement is often met with a nasty slap to the face. Nash initially struggles through his time at Princeton University, simply unable to inspire that ""truly original idea"" that is ""the only way he will ever distinguish himself∂? the only way he will ever matter."" He has few friends; his only true support comes from his chatty, laid-back roommate, Charles (Paul Bettany). After graduating from Princeton, Nash becomes a doctor of mathematics, but, to his disgruntlement, his duties include teaching a class. It is here that he meets Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), who is able to accept him for the man he is, but soon sets about giving him a ""beautiful heart"" in addition to his ""beautiful mind."" However, Nash's world is suddenly plunged into chaos when a federal agent named Parcher (Ed Harris) approaches him to perform top-secret code-breaking work for the Department of Defense. 'A Beautiful Mind' is a haunting and inspirational biopic from Ron Howard (""Apollo 13""), who gives us perhaps his greatest film to date. Adapted by Akiva Goldsman from the biography by Sylvia Nasar, this film features terrific performances from a stellar cast, including a phenomenal Russell Crowe at the top of his game. You could argue that the screenplay sometimes embellishes on the truth for dramatic effect, but this can be easily forgiven in light of the often heart-wrenching drama we witness on screen. After all, like I've always said, ""don't let the truth get in the way of a good story!""  "
106683,tt0018455,ackstasis,australia,9,"For wherever the sun rises and sets... life is much the same; sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet.","'Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)' is simply one of the most breathtaking motion pictures of the silent era, and certainly one of the most effective to have originated in Hollywood. However, the film's creative talent arrived from overseas, when William Fox, founder of the Fox Films Corporation, lured German director F.W. Murnau over to the United States with the promise of a greater budget and complete artistic freedom. Murnau, who had previously brought German Expressionism to its creative peak with 'Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922)' and 'Faust - Eine deutsche Volkssage (1926),' spared no expense at his new American studio, and the result is quite possibly his most extraordinary storytelling achievement, blending reality and fantasy into a wonderfully-balanced melodramatic fable of love and redemption. Though inevitably overshadowed by the arrival of ""talkies"" with 'The Jazz Singer (1927),' the film was also the first to utilize the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system, which allowed the inclusion of roughly-synchronised music, sound effects and a few garbled voices. Just as he did in 'Der letzte Mann / The Last Laugh (1924),' Murnau makes sparing use of intertitles, and so the film relies very heavily on visuals in order to propel the story and invoke the desired mood. During his mercilessly short-lived career, the German director subscribed to two distinct film-making styles: German Expressionism, which deliberately exaggerated geometry and lighting for symbolic purposes, and the short-lived Kammerspiel (""chamber-drama"") genre, most readily noticed in 'The Last Laugh,' which bordered on neo-realistic at times, but also pioneered the moving camera in order to capture the intimacy of a character's point-of-view. 'Sunrise' appears to have been influenced by both styles. The fable of The Man (George O'Brien) and The Wife (Janet Gaynor), its time and place purposefully vague, fittingly takes place in a plane of reality not quite aligned with our own, without straying too perceptibly into the realm of fantasy. Murnau also had mammoth sets created for the city sequences, fantastically stylised and exaggerated to re-enforce the picture's fairytale ambiance. The characters in 'Sunrise' are best viewed as archetypes, performing a very specific function in Murnau's moral parable. The story's primary themes are forgiveness and redemption. The Man, a misguided fool torn between two lovers, is driven to the brink of murder, but manages to stop himself at the final moment. The remainder of the film involves The Man's attempts at, not only understanding the gravity of what might have been, but also to recall his former love for his wife. I can't imagine what camera filters must have been used to transform Janet Gaynor into the supreme personification of innocence and vulnerability, but she is the most heartbreakingly-helpless figure since Lillian Gish in 'Broken Blossoms (1919).' Even so, for the bulk of the film, the power to reconcile their estranged marriage lies solely within the hands of The Wife, whose role in the story is to recognise the remorse of her husband, and, in accordance with their sacred wedding vows, to forgive him his shameful transgressions. The development of the moving camera was a crucial step towards the dynamic style of cinema that we now enjoy. Though the first notable use of the technique was in 'The Last Laugh,' and Murnau is said to have used it even earlier, some of the sequences in 'Sunrise' are simply beyond words in their gracefulness and beauty. In easily the most memorable long-take of the film, and perhaps even the decade, Karl Struss and Charles Rosher's camera sweeps behind The Man as he makes his way through the moon-lit scrub-land, before overtaking him, passing through a swathe of tree branches and arriving at The Women From the City (Margaret Livingston), who applies her make-up and waits for the married suitor whom she is about to convince to murder his wife. I first caught a split-second glimpse of this wonderful shot in Chuck Workman's montage short, 'Precious Images (1986),' and it's a telling sign that, of all the four hundred or so movies briefly exhibited in that film, it was this one that caught my eye.

110547,tt1205489,ackstasis,australia,7,What the hell does everybody want with my Gran Torino?,"One can approach 'Gran Torino (2008)' as a sort of coda to the two roles that made Clint Eastwood famous: The Man with No Name and Harry Callahan, both of whom fought for justice, but did so by whipping out a gun and shooting a whole lot of people. Having presumably become more conservative in his old age, Eastwood's grouchy hero here comes to learn that vigilante justice isn't necessarily the right way to do things (though, admittedly, having a firearm close at hand does occasionally prove useful). Eastwood's sympathetic lead performance is what gives the film its strength. Walt Kowalksi is a bitter, grumpy and bigoted old man, but he apparently has every reason to be so: his wife has passed on, his own children can't stand to be around him, and his only companionship comes from the sleepy labrador at his side. As we come to learn, however, this is a prison that Walt may arguably have built for himself, so embittered by his Korean War service that he has shuns the affections of all those who reach out to him. Eastwood's lead performance is complemented by sincere (if slightly unconvincing) work from the supporting players, particularly Bee Vang and Ahney Her as Hmong-American youths who move in next door, much to Walt's consternation. In any case, it is the tired, weathered face of Clint Eastwood that dominates the film; few actors could make the phrase ""get off my lawn"" sound quite so menacing, and yet his lines also project a certain frailness, of a once-potent force dwindling in body and spirit. 'Gran Torino' is one of Eastwood's most enjoyable dramas of the decade.  "
111220,tt0118715,ackstasis,australia,6,I Was A Bit Underwhelmed By This Film...,"First of all, I love the Coen brothers. Just about every one of their films is stunningly written, with enough wit in their dialogue to rival Tarantino in his 'Pulp Fiction' form. Stunningly directed, riotously funny and brimming with unique and colourful characters, their films are always a pleasure to watch. Jeff Bridges portrays Jeffrey Lebowski, a man who'd rather just be called The Dude. However, when criminals mistake him for a rich Jeffrey Lebowski (The Big Lebowski), a misinformed break-and-entry results in The Dude's prized rug getting urinated upon. ""That rug really held the room together,"" a dejected Dude remarks, and so he goes to visit The Big Lebowski, whom he considers responsible for such an unpleasant occurrence. Little does The Dude realise that his visit will bring about considerable more trouble than just a soiled rug... 'The Big Lebowski,' like most Coen brothers' films, is certainly a funny and reasonably well-written story, however, I found myself slightly underwhelmed by it. A lot of the time, it felt like weird characters were simply thrown into the mix simply to be weird, without serving any real purpose. I'm yet to work out the reasons for including the Stranger (Sam Elliott), whose cowboy-type character narrates the the beginning and the end of the story, with a brief cameo appearance somewhere in the middle. The completely unnecessary breaking of the ""fourth wall"" at the end of the film just seemed out of place with the rest of the story. And how did the Stranger even know about the Dude's story, having just exchanged a few words with him at the bowling bar? It beats me, but perhaps I'm just completely missing the point. However, these grievances aside, it must be said that there are many genuinely funny moments in this film, most of them arising from John Goodman's perfectly-played character, Walter Sobchak. With stunning comedic timing, the Coen film regular (Barton Fink, O Brother Where Art Thou) hilariously spouts out his well-written dialogue, which usually (for no apparent reason) references Sobchak's own service in the Vietnam War, or otherwise belittles his under-appreciated and often-ignored bowling partner Donny Kerabatsos (Steve Buscemi). 'The Big Lebowski' is a funny film, and well worth your time. However, I was simply unable to take it seriously as a film (nor should I have tried), so I couldn't rate it any higher. It just didn't have the professional class of the Coen brothers' other films...  "
112538,tt0046912,ackstasis,australia,8,Do you really believe in the perfect murder?,"1954 was an excellent year for fans of the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. Not only did he release 'Rear Window' ∂? widely considered his best film ∂? but also 'Dial M for Murder,' his lesser-revered, but certainly not inferior suspenseful murder film. The first of Hitchcock's three collaborations with the beautiful Grace Kelly (along with 'Rear Window' and 'To Catch a Thief'), it was arguably 'Dial M for Murder' that cemented Kelly's reputation as a genuine acting talent, assuring her enduring legacy despite a painfully short-lived film career. The film was adapted very closely by Frederick Knott from his own stage play of the same name, which had previously premiered as a BBC television play two years earlier. 'Dial M for Murder' bears certain resemblances to Hitchcock's 1948 film, 'Rope,' in that both are based on stage plays (the latter adapted from a play by Patrick Hamilton), both take place largely in the one setting, and both plots entail characters attempting to get away with ""the perfect murder."" The setting for 'Dial M for Murder' is an upper-class flat at 61A Charrington Gardens, Maida Vale, London. Most of the film's plot unfolds within these walls, though there is also a single scene set in a restaurant, and a very brief, highly-stylised courtroom montage. Staying true to its stage roots, the film relies heavily on character conversation to advance its plot, a style that could potentially become tedious in less experienced hands. However, the mastery of Hitchcock, coupled with the quality of the acting performances, successfully infuses the film with an ever-present atmosphere of intrigue and suspense. When famous former tennis star Tony Wendice (Ray Milland) discovers that his beautiful and wealthy wife Margot (Grace Kelly) has been cheating on him with American crime writer Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), he begins to plot the perfect revenge. Enlisting ∂? via blackmail ∂? the services of an ex-college acquaintance (Anthony Dawson), Tony plans to orchestrate the perfect murder of his unfaithful wife without implicating himself. However, as Mark points out to him, the ""perfect murder"" might not be quite as achievable as it seems: ""because, in stories, things usually turn out the way the author wants them to; and in real life, they don't... always."" Just like in many of his films, Hitchcock heightens the suspense by subversively enlisting our sympathies for the villain. Nobody in their right minds would wish for the lovely Grace Kelly to be murdered, but somehow we are manipulated into almost hoping that Tony's plan is a success, and we revel in his sly brilliance as he recovers from his initial failure to implement an equally-devious Plan B. By doing this, Hitchcock makes the audience feel as though they are, themselves, a part of the crime, and as though their own fates hinge on the outcome of Chief Insp. Hubbard's (John Williams) investigation. Nonetheless, it is inevitable that the villain be brought to justice, and Tony's inability to accurately predict human behaviour becomes the single, gaping flaw in his flawless plans. To counteract the potential tedium of a film set almost entirely in the one room, Hitchcock makes clever use of colours and camera angles. To trace the downward spiral of an innocent woman who became the focus of sinister deeds, Hitchcock arranged for Grace Kelly to be dressed in bright colours at the start of the film and made them progressively darker as time goes on. A viewer would also, no doubt, have noticed the prevalence of low-angle shots with household objects sometimes, such as lamps, standing between the cast members and the camera. This was done to exploit the 3D-format in which the film was originally shot, though, by the time of the film's release, interest in this gimmick had substantially waned, and only a handful of cinemas showed the film in this way. Nonetheless, even without the 3D, this style of cinematography places the viewer in a unique position, as though they are hidden within the room and secretly observing the characters' most intimate moments. Whilst 'Dial M for Murder' managed to keep my attention throughout its running time, the first half of the film was noticeably more suspenseful than the subsequent half. This ""drop-off"" might well have been because, in the film's final act, the audience's perspective parts from that of the villain and meets up with the shrewd Englishman detective, Hubbard. From this moment forth, the outcome of the investigation was never really in any doubt, and Tony was bound to be arrested and tried for attempted murder. Every moment up to this point, however, was completely unpredictable, and one hundred percent genuine Alfred Hitchcock suspense.  "
113175,tt0031381,ackstasis,australia,8,It's an historic moment you can tell your grandchildren about - how you watched the Old South fall one night.,"Producer David O. Selznick must have known in advance that 'Gone with the Wind (1939)' would become the highest-grossing motion picture ever made. He purchased the rights to Margaret Mitchell's bestselling novel for an unprecedented $50,000, heaped a truckload of money into the project and exhausted the efforts of no less than three directors ∂? Victor Fleming, George Cukor, Sam Wood and possibly a few others, including William Cameron Menzies and B. Reeves Eason. Such was Selznick's passion for the project that he is typically credited as the prime architect of the film's success, a definitive exception to the auteur theory ∂? unless, of course, one simply considers Selznick to be the auteur. The extravagance of the production is instantly recognised in the film's elaborate costume and set design, in addition to Ernest Haller's sweeping epic cinematography. If it weren't for such lavishness, the picture might easily have vanished into the background as a stuffy, overwrought melodrama; but film-making of this magnitude leaves a considerable imprint on one's memory, and audiences have come to epitomise 'Gone with the Wind' as the embodiment of Hollywood's Golden Age. The most exciting acts of the story, which was adapted by Sidney Howard from Mitchell's novel, take place during the Civil War, when the triumphant Yankees are marching towards Atlanta, casting an ominous shadow over the ill-fated city. The grandiose scope of the photography ∂? the seemingly-endless sprawl of wounded soldiers, the desperate last-minute dash past the blazing munitions factory ∂? would go unrivalled until the late 1950s, when David Lean discovered the widescreen camera. Clarke Gable was the fans' only choice for the role of the roguish but noble Rhett Butler, but it's Scarlett O'Hara whom I find most interesting, even if I disliked her more and more as the film progressed. The 1930s was very much a decade of change in how women were portrayed in cinema, with actresses such as Mae West ('I'm No Angel (1933)') and Bette Davis ('Dark Victory (1939)') achieving success as smart, independent characters, shifting away from the notion of the ""damsel in distress."" Scarlett, a role eventually given to unknown Vivien Leigh, was the apex of the independent woman ∂? so independent, in fact, that she could never be happy in love with a man. The film has a fascinatingly-ambivalent relationship with its main protagonist, Scarlett O'Hara. She is obviously a very strong female character, and her resourcefulness and enterprise in difficult times is justly-celebrated∂? however, at what price? In order to spite the Yankees for destroying her way of life, Scarlett essentially becomes those whom she holds in such contempt, surrendering any remaining traces of honour or integrity. There's no doubt that she commits damnable atrocities, often at the expense of those who love her, but the film can't quite bring itself to hate her ∂? the audience is left suspended in midstream, presented with a wolf in sheep's clothing, but nonetheless expected to celebrate the clothing for its practicality and expediency. Conversely, Melanie Hamilton (the lovely Olivia de Havilland) embodies kindness and selflessness, but she is inevitably doomed to a premature death, perhaps a product of her inability to adapt to this new lifestyle. In the gritty aftermath of the American Civil War, the kind and decent are condemned to an uneasy demise, whereas the crass, opportunistic Scarlett lives to greet another day. The film should have ended with Clarke Gable's immortal parting words, a fade to black as his figure disappears forever into the mist, with our selfish and unprincipled anti-heroine having finally received her comeuppance, three times filled and running over. After stopping at nothing to obtain what she wants, Scarlett ultimately finds that she has been chasing an illusion, and, in the meantime, she has pushed away all that she still holds dear in this world, the one man who potentially offered her a lifetime of happiness. But, alas, Selznick had a lot of money riding on this picture, and it certainly would not have done to disappoint the ladies in the audience. Instead, the film concludes with Scarlett's optimistic epitaph ∂? ""after all, tomorrow is another day!"" ∂? implying that she may eventually win Rhett back, or, at least, that she'll never stop trying. Whether I want her to succeed is an entirely different matter. Scarlett is almost the female equivalent of Tim Holt's George Amberson-Minafer, arrogant and thoroughly deserving of a comeuppance, and neither deserved a happy ending, regardless of whether or not the studio provided one.  "
113946,tt0116282,ackstasis,australia,7,"Blood has been shed, Jerry.","It's probably inevitable that, after hearing so much about its greatness, 'Fargo' proves something of a minor disappointment. After numerous critical successes {including their finest film to date, 'Miller's Crossing (1990)' and the Palme d'Or-winning 'Barton Fink (1991)'}, Joel and Ethan Coen apparently struck gold with 'Fargo (1996),' the ""true story"" of a kidnapping and murder in the icy wastelands of Minnesota. The film is a thematic retread of the brothers' debut picture, 'Blood Simple (1984)' {of which I was not overly-fond}, and explores how a seemingly-simple crime can escalate into the tragic and devastating destruction of innocent (and not-so-innocent) lives. The Coens would return once again to this popular theme with the accomplished film-noir, 'The Man Who Wasn't There (2001),' which is arguably one of their best efforts. 'Fargo' was the filmmakers' first real Oscar success, retrieving seven Academy Award nominations and two wins (Best Writing and Best Actress in a Leading Role {Francis McDormand}). However, the film's Best Picture chances were upset by Anthony Minghella's majestic wartime romance epic, 'The English Patient.' In a dreary small-town region of the United States, where the road is perpetually covered in frost and a sheet of ice affixes itself to your car windscreen, money-troubled father Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) plots a simple, fool-proof method of acquiring funds. He hires two dubious-looking thugs (Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare) to kidnap his own wife (Kristin Rudr«¨d), in order to extort ransom money from his wealthy, domineering father-in-law (Wade Gustafson). However, things don't go quite to plan, and after the two low-life criminals murder a state trooper and two passing witnesses, local Brainerd Chief of Police Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) arrives to investigate. She, like almost every other character in the film, has the jovial disposition and exaggerated mannerisms of typical Midwestern small-town folk, discussing a triple-homicide as though somebody has just stolen a cookie from the jar, and making frequent use of such quaint phrases as ""You betcha,"" ""Aw Jeez,"" ""Okie-Dokie"" and ""Yah."" The Coens have done a lot right with 'Fargo.' Their decision to blend a thrilling tale of deceit and murder with moments of satirical ∂? almost slapstick ∂? comedy creates a unique and interesting contrast that sets the film apart from most thrillers. William H. Macy is at his jittery best as a potential con-man so hopelessly inept that he can't call off the dangerous ruse because he never acquired the kidnappers' phone number. Steve Buscemi is, likewise, fantastic as Carl Showalter, a ""funny-looking"" weasel with a hot temper. Peter Stormare is suitably psychotic as the sullen but dangerous Gaear Grimsrud, even if his role just required him to remain silent and look creepy. Then we come to Frances McDormand (a.k.a. Mrs. Joel Coen), who, regardless of her talents as an actress, has annoyed me in every film in which I've seen her {which basically just covers 'Blood Simple,' 'Fargo' and 'The Man Who Wasn't There,' though to a lesser extent in the latter}. I know that Marge Gunderson is supposed to be one of the Coen Brothers' most entertaining creations, but her character somehow seemed so pointless. We spend all our time following her lightweight attempts at an investigation, and yet all I cared about was the kidnapping and how Jerry was coping with it all. Perhaps to hide the fact that Marge has almost nothing to do, the Coens toss in a couple of extraneous, dead-end minor characters who serve no purpose other than to distract me from the more exciting segments of the story. All things considered, 'Fargo' is a solid, albeit flawed, thriller/comedy that is characteristic of the Coens in every respect. Allow me to reiterate that William H. Macy was absolutely phenomenal, and definitely gives the film's greatest performance, though I did think that his character gave himself away too easily. In the grand scheme of things, 'Fargo' could certainly scrape into the directors' top five films, though my hope is that their latest release, 'No Country For Old Men (2007),' will oust it from the list.

114227,tt0032976,ackstasis,australia,9,She knew everyone that mattered. Everyone loved her.,"By the end of the 1930s, working for Michael Balcon at the Gaumont-British Picture Corporation , director Alfred Hitchcock was heading towards the peak of his artistic potential. Films such as 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934),' 'The 39 Steps (1935)' and 'The Lady Vanishes (1938)' became both critical and commercial successes, and so it was only a matter of time before he was tempted over to Hollywood to pursue even greater fame and fortune. Though his working relationship with independent producer David O. Selznick proved constantly frustrating ∂? Selznick often demanded a large amount of creative control over his films ∂? their very first collaboration proved one of Hitchcock's most successful, with 'Rebecca (1940)' becoming his only film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Based on Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel of the same name, 'Rebecca' is a tense, atmospheric Gothic melodrama about the lingering influence of the story's unseen title character, long after her own death. Relative newcomer Joan Fontaine plays a young, modest woman who falls in love with a wealthy widower, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier), who still apparently mourns the death of his wife, Rebecca. Following a humble wedding in Monte Carlo, the two lovers return to Maxim's sprawling Manderley estate in Cornwall, England, where the servants ∂? especially the chillingly creepy Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) ∂? find it difficult to accept this young bride as the new Mrs. de Winter. Whenever Fontaine's character finds herself within the walls of her new home, the atmosphere in each of the rooms is discomforting, even suffocating, as she struggles vainly to assimilate into a world for which she is unsuited. Her character symbolically remains without a given name, reinforcing the story's stance that she is without an individual identity; as long as she remains with Maxim, she will continue to be evaluated against Rebecca, and will be forever in the lingering shadow of Maxim's long-dead, ""perfect"" previous wife. The Master of Suspense certainly knew how to make an entrance into Hollywood, and 'Rebecca' is definitely one of his top ten films {out of the twenty-seven that I've seen thus far}. Though, at 130 minutes, it is one of the longest motion pictures that Hitchcock ever produced, the film never drags nor feels overly cumbersome, with the extended running time merely prolonging the suffering that the audience must endure through Fontaine's innocent, continually-threatened character. This isn't the sort of thriller that lulls you into a false sense of security and then shocks you, since that was simply not Hitchcock's style. Like another Gothic thriller of which I am fond, George Cukor's 'Gaslight (1944),' the main character is forever at ill-ease with her surroundings, and we, as the audience, are never afforded the luxury of feeling safe and secure. Rebecca de Winter is one of the most meticulously-detailed unseen characters in the history of cinema, and, without the story ever straying into supernatural territory, it seems as though her lingering presence is somehow orchestrating the disturbing events of the film.

Having experienced a lifetime of difficulty and oppression, Luke is one man who never learned to conform to society, and who is willing to sacrifice himself in order to avoid compromising his own integrity. On many occasions, the motivation behind Luke's actions are dubious at best {his numerous escape attempts appear to have been orchestrated for the mere sake of rebellion}, but this all adds to the lure of his enigmatic personality. Many critics have noted the film's scattered Biblical references, with some proposing that Newman's character is an allusion to Christ, who mentored a group of ""disciples"" before offering his own life in the face of tyranny. Directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and wonderfully captured by cinematographer Conrad L. Hall {whose final film, 'Road to Perdition (2002)' is among the most beautiful of the new century}, the story of ""Cool Hand Luke"" remains one of cinema's most definitive prison dramas. Influencing, in some way or another, just about every prison movie that followed, and bearing more than a passing resemblance to Milos Forman's masterpiece 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975),' the film's legacy has continued to stretch into the present, and the Captain's (Strother Martin) memorable line ""What we've got here is failure to communicate"" continues to be quoted often. Of course, it is Cool Hand Luke whom we shall always remember so vividly, his nickname representative of his independence, individualism and unwillingness to conform. Newman's superb performance was nominated for an Academy Award at the 1968 Oscars, but he was beaten by an equally-memorable Rod Steiger for 'In the Heat of the Night (1967).' Unthinkably, the film itself was denied a Best Picture nomination, presumably to make way for the epic musical 'Dr. Dolittle (1967),' a childhood favourite of mine that nonetheless should never have been nominated. The picture's single award went to George Kennedy, who is marvellous as Dragline, a tough, imposing but supportive inmate who strikes up a very close friendship with the prison's resident ""messiah.""

121570,tt0477348,ackstasis,australia,8,"Even in the contest between man and steer, the issue is not certain.","There are very few filmmakers working today who can match up against Joel and Ethan Coen. Since their neo-noirish debut with 'Blood Simple. (1984),' the brother directors have dominated modern cinema with their unique brand of writing and storytelling, evoking the atmosphere of classic films while always maintaining a distinct sense of originality. 'No Country for Old Men (2007)' comes after a somewhat disappointing five-year stretch, during which they produced the second-tier remake, 'The Ladykillers (2003),' and the fun but inconsequential 'Intolerable Cruelty (2004).' Adapting the 2005 novel by Cormac McCarthy, the Coens have created one of the most harrowingly-intense cinema experiences you'll have all year, a cat-and-mouse game of drugs, violence, money and murder that will leave you gasping for air, and clawing at your armrest in search of some comfort. While this film is not the pair's most respectable outing ∂? there's a certain roughness to the film that I couldn't quite connect with ∂? they've certainly never delivered anything so chillingly gruesome and suspenseful. The year is 1980. When local hunter Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) happens upon the site of a massacre in the middle of the parched, Texan desert, the apparent aftermath of drug deal gone wrong, his discovery of the $2 million payment, bunched neatly in a leather suitcase, prompts him to make a few decisions he'll come to regret later on. A psychopathic hit-man, Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a grotesque killer with no scruples, arrives at the scene to recover the money, only to find the loot missing and the remains of Llewelyn's abandoned vehicle. While the two men play a deadly game of hide-and-seek across the Texan countryside ∂? Anton killing fellow conspirators, law enforcers and innocent victims at every turn ∂? soon-to-be-retired sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) reluctantly follows, disillusioned by the overwhelming amount of evil present in the current world. The exploits of these three main characters, though they rarely share the screen, seem to blend feverishly among one another, and the eventual outcome of the story is one that you're unlikely to see coming. Anton Chigurh is certainly one of the more formidable villains to come our way in recent years. Though lacking the complexity of somebody like Hannibal Lecter, Chigurh is most terrifying because he is the complete opposite: silent, methodical, ruthless∂? His actions are almost mechanical in their simplicity and practicality; he will do whatever is needed to get the job done, with little thought for human life {it would not be unreasonable to liken Chigurh to the Terminator (1984)}. His opening scene is the cinematic equivalent of a violent kick in the gut, a sequence as shockingly violent as I've seen in the first five minutes of any movie in recent memory {though, admittedly, I do tend to stay away from any film that promises a lot of bloodshed}. After this, the Coens show no signs of letting up, and, time after time, we are treated to one graphic death after another. The presence of a few off-screen murders does show that the two filmmakers' awareness that a cut-away is often more appropriate, but I think perhaps their penchant for blood takes the film a bit too far. I'm generally all right with violence if it contributes to the story, but at what point does it simply become gratuitous? Sprinkled amongst all the tattered bodies in Anton Chigurh's wake is a Coen Brothers script that delivers the black humour and witty dialogue of most of their previous films. The screenplay cleverly interweaves the extreme violence of the story with an amusing combination of droll banter and uneasy conversation, most noticeable in the scene in which Chigurh challenges a nervous service station owner to a coin toss (""what's the most you ever lost on a coin toss?""). Though I chuckled quite regularly, I also feel the need to denounce the film-goer in the row ahead of me, who, rather distractingly, laughed at every single line as though it was the greatest thing since Charles Chaplin got himself caught on the conveyor belt. 'No Country for Old Men' is most stylistically similar to the Coens' debut effort, 'Blood Simple. (1984),' and, thematically, it deals with the same issues explored in both this and 'Fargo (1996);' namely, the corrupting power of money. The ending for the film, which was greeted by a hushed moment of universal confusion in the cinema, remains true to the source material. Though it was undoubtedly interesting to hear Sheriff Ed Tom Bell recounting his confused and insightful dreams, the tension in the final twenty minutes drops off so dramatically that ""anti-climax"" is the only word that comes to mind. The Sheriff's vision of his long-deceased father ""riding on past"" and ""fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold"" is an obvious allusion to death and the possible afterlife. As near as I can tell, and I have a history of missing the point on such thing, the dream seems to be summarising the film by declaring that there is evil in the world, there always has been evil in the world, and there always will be. Perhaps the only way you can escape this evil is in death, where the Sheriff's father is waiting for him by a roaring fire in the depths of the cold, dark night.  "
125591,tt0469494,ackstasis,australia,8,There are times when I look at people and I see nothing worth liking.,"For several decades at the turn of the twentieth century, oil was the life-blood of the United States of America. Ordinary men became millionaires practically overnight, and thriving towns sprung up wherever an ocean of oil was discovered underground. Then again, many men failed in all attempts to achieve wealth through oil drilling, and countless lost their lives in the feverish pursuit of ""black gold."" Though the period, in the decades before the Great Depression would bring an entire world to its knees, proved a particularly prosperous time for America, it is also marked by significant incidents of corruption, bribery and betrayal. My first film from director Paul Thomas Anderson {who has previously achieved success with 'Boogie Nights (1997),' 'Magnolia (1999)' and 'Punch-Drunk Love (2002)'} is a loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, ""Oil!"" An exceptional epic, a grand and sweeping saga of the early years of the oil business, 'There Will Be Blood (2007)' traces the fortunes of Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), an charismatic prospector who achieves enormous wealth despite (or perhaps thanks to) his disdain for the human race. Daniel Day-Lewis, an actor whose dedication to his roles has become legendary, is absolutely superb in the starring role, bringing an incredible intensity to Plainview that simply demands your complete and utter attention. The audience hangs onto his every word with an awed hush; when Daniel Plainview is speaking, you know that he means what he says. Throughout his harsh life, he has always expressed unbridled contempt for the people around him; when we first meet Plainview, he is mining alone for silver, his distrust of others even then driving him towards solitude. When necessity forces him to hire additional workers, a horrific drilling accident leaves an infant orphaned, and so Plainview decides to adopt young H.W. (Dillon Freasier, Russell Harvard as an adult) as his own. At first, we consider this to be an uncharacteristic act of kindness, perhaps evidence of a streak of humanity that lurks far within. However, time soon reveals Plainview's scheme, and the unfortunate H.W. finds himself to be little more than a prop, a fresh young family face to be used to underline his father's business propositions. Another prevalent theme of the film is the hypocrisy of religion. Paul Dano is excellent as Eli Sunday, a local faith-healer for the Church of the Third Revelation. Throughout the film, we are influenced into regarded Eli and Plainview as two opposing entities ∂? namely, as Good versus Evil. However, by the end of the film, the former is shown to be as corrupt and dishonest as any other man. Plainview has long disregarded all religion as superstition, but agrees to participate in a humiliating initiation ceremony in order to secure the leasing rights to an old man's (Hans Howes) tract of land. This demonstration first highlights Eli's underlying streak of depravity, but all is exposed in the Wall Street stock-market crash of 1929, when Plainview sadistically taunts Eli into denouncing himself as a ""false prophet"" and his God as ""a superstition."" In a highly unorthodox but exceedingly fascinating conclusion, a drunken Plainview bludgeons Eli to death with a bowling pin, the faith-healer effectively, though inadvertently, martyring himself in order to punish the sins that have gone unpunished for so very long. 'There Will Be Blood' is brimming with astonishing set-pieces, most memorably the ""blow-out"" of oil from the Little Boston well, and the subsequent oil fire. We do, indeed, detect another momentary streak of paternal humanity in Plainview's frenzied scurry to rescue his permanently-deafened son, both covered from head-to-toe in black veins of oil, though this swiftly dissipates as he abandons his son to tend to the flaming well. P.T. Anderson is known for his bold and unique cinematic style, and his latest film won't appeal to all audiences {my three friends afterward described the film as, respectively, ""good,"" ""all right"" and ""terrible""}, but the expertise with which the film is produced is undeniable. At tomorrow's Academy Awards, I would not be surprised if 'There Will Be Blood' takes out the Best Picture honours, even if {having seen four of the five nominees} my fingers are crossed for a Coen brothers' win.

126286,tt0091251,ackstasis,australia,10,Harrowingly realistic; the true horrors of war,"Russian director Elem Klimov's final film, 'Idi i smotri {Come and See},' is a masterpiece of the genre, a war film so disturbingly intense that it strays into the realms of psychological horror. Set in 1943, during the Nazi occupation of Belarus, the film follows the fate of a young boy, Florya Gaishun (Aleksei Kravchenko), who joins the Soviet partisan army. As the horrors of war unfold before him, Florya loses his idealistic preconceptions of combat, becoming confused and psychologically unstable. The entire film is witnessed through his young eyes, as his civilised world is thrown into turmoil and those that he loves perish at the hands of a merciless enemy. Much like Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now,' the film is almost surrealistic in its exploration of the horrors of war, constructing a hallucinatory nightmare of escalating confusion, fear, death and madness. And yet, despite this, the film manages to come across as being frighteningly realistic. Perhaps this surrealistic approach is also, paradoxically, the most realistic depiction of war. Young Florya is cast into a hellish world he simply can't comprehend; placed in the same position, I imagine, the experience would strike us as being one long, distressing and horrible dream. Florya seemingly even treats it all as such. With the ghastly events happening all about him, he can do nothing but stare with petrified shock and awe, as one who expects to wake up at any moment. 'Come and See' boasts a string of remarkable sequences which will resonate with viewers for a long time after they see it. A series of bomb strikes tear apart a Russian forest, silently obliterating the mature trees as a shell-shocked Florya hears only the maddening ringing in his ears; Florya attempts to clamber through a thick, murky bog, feeling with each step as though he is getting nowhere; he awakens in the midst of a thick mist, his head resting on the carcass of a dead cow. Perhaps the most lasting scene is one in which an entire population of villagers is herded into a barn, and then consequently set alight. Words fail to describe the horror of watching the flaming barn doors still flapping wildly as the inhabitants fight with their last breaths to save themselves and their families. Meanwhile, Florya just stares, his blank, disbelieving expression infinitely more effective than any other actions would have been. Inexperienced teenager Aleksei Kravchenko is excellent in the lead role, which the director subsequently described as ""a very difficult role with extreme emotional states."" So arduous were the emotional burdens of the film that Klimov later expressed surprise and relief that young Kravchenko did not suffer any adverse psychological trauma during and after filming, which notably employed the use of live ammunition to maximise authenticity. His character is placed in situations that are, to us, simply impossible to fathom, and Florya reacts to these changes in his life with a sort of awed silence, sometimes anger. Young actress Olga Mironova, apparently in her only film role, plays a pivotal role as Glasha, whom Florya befriends in the early part of the film. The film ends with a simple but very disturbing montage of archive footage. As Florya attempts to symbolically destroy Adolf Hitler by firing bullets at his portrait, the black-and-white World War II footage rapidly rewinds: we see corpses at a concentration camp, a 1930s Nazi party rally, Hitler's services during World War I. As Florya fires more and more bullets, the images continue to reverse themselves, as though eradicating the history from existence. Finally, we arrive at a photograph of Adolf Hitler sitting on his mother's lap as a young baby. Unlike the Nazi savages who felt no remorse in torching entire villages to the ground, Florya cannot bring himself to symbolically murder this innocent child, even with the knowledge of the horrors he would later orchestrate. Is this morality the reason why wars are an inevitable consequence of human existence? Though the final reel does undoubtedly stray towards propaganda (the Russian citizens are clearly shown to possess superior morals to those of the evil, fiendish Germans), the entire film is executed so disturbingly perfectly that you are too engrossed in the spectacle to really notice at all. There is no clear resolution to the story. Of course, the valiant Soviets successfully triumph over the company of Nazis, but they then strike off for another confrontation. The War will go on forever, and Florya will never be given a reprieve from all the horrors he has witnessed. The original working title of the film had been ""Kill Hitler,"" not specifically referring to the infamous dictator, but with a more general meaning. As Klimov explains in the DVD preface to his film, he meant the title to suggest that we should kill the ""Hitler"" within ourselves, ""because we all have our demons in this or that measure."" However, after the title was deemed inappropriate, another was chosen from chapter 6 the Book of Revelations: ""...and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, ""Come and see!"""" 'Come and See' was the final film that Klimov ever directed. Having experienced World War II with his own eyes as a child, he felt that it was a film that he needed to make, and, after doing so, he was no longer compelled to continue directing. The director comments, once again on the DVD preface: ""I don't regret that I made that film. It had a difficult pre-history and history. But one has to make it a difference once in a while, to commit something worthy. Herein lies the sense of creative work, when you can offer to people something real serious, real meaningful∂?"" Simply put, this is the masterpiece that he was born to make, and a single viewing will ultimately change the way that you view war.  "
126619,tt0025316,ackstasis,australia,8,I want to see what love looks like when it's triumphant. I haven't had a good laugh in a week.,"Released in 1934, Frank Capra's 'It Happened One Night' ushered in a new era of Hollywood film-making ∂? the screwball comedy ∂? and made Academy Award history in the process. It became the first film to be awarded the top five awards on the night (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay), a feat that remained unequaled until 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975)' and 'The Silence of the Lambs (1991).' As I watch more of his films, Frank Capra is fast becoming one of my most respected directors, with such classics as 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' and 'It's a Wonderful Life' ranking among my favourites of all time. This screwball comedy, however, posed a certain problem, since I've never been a huge fan of the sub-genre. Whilst I had enjoyed such films as 'My Man Godfrey' and 'His Girl Friday,' they hadn't really offered anything other than comedy. This means that they did a good job of making us laugh, but never really inspired any other emotions ∂? which isn't necessarily a handicap, but doesn't appeal to my tastes. Happily, I'm able to announce that 'It Happened One Night' did surpass my expectations, and I found it to be a wonderfully-enjoyable, very touching romantic comedy. The first half had left me feeling a bit uncertain, since it reminded me of just about every other 1930s comedy I'd seen, but then Frank Capra did what Frank Capra does best: he put a lot of heart into the film. After building towards a perfect fairytale ending, Capra suddenly snatches it away, slowly but surely stacking the odds against our hero. However, the director has never been one to leave us with a downbeat ending, and, when love finally prevails, it feels twice as triumphant. Of course, crucial to the film's success are the two lead performers: Claudette Colbert and Clarke Gable, playing characters of completely polar characters. As story runs its course, we slowly watch their relationship transform from completely dislike to acceptance to romance, and it never feels forced or artificial (despite a reportedly tense atmosphere onset). The plot of the film was based on the story, ""The Night Bus,"" by Samuel Hopkins Adams. Ellie Andrews (Colbert) is the arrogant, spoilt heiress of a wealthy father (Walter Connolly). After she marries the rich but unprincipled King Westley (Jameson Thomas) against her father's will, Ellie strikes off to New York to be with the man she loves, and her desperate father launches a state-wide attempt to retrieve her. It is on a night bus that Ellie strikes up a frictional relationship with fired journalist Peter Warne (Gable), whose only initial interest in the stranded girl is a good newspaper story. Probably one of the best ""road movies"" ever made, 'It Happened One Night' also has a few twists in the usual formula which have guaranteed its enduring stature. For example, Ellie's father is revealed not to be an evil overbearing demon, but is, in fact, shown to be a very kind, reasonable and loving man, who is only trying to guarantee the best for his daughter by ensuring that she marries somebody with principles (King Westley later gives up the girl without a fuss, compensated by a tidy sum of money). Much to my surprise, I'd never seen a film starring Clarke Gable before, but he really was a revelation. Never taking any situation too seriously, and delivering every line with confidence and a hint of amusement, Gable is the laid-back every-man that the audience can relate to, a stark contrast to Colbert's conceited and ungrateful upper-class rich girl. My favourite scene took place after the night bus accidentally ran off the road, with the shifty passenger Oscar Shapeley (Roscoe Karns) threatening to reveal Ellie's true identity. Fearing that his exclusive story could leak into other hands, Peter Warne declares himself to be the gangster who kidnapped Ellie, threatens to harm Shapeley's family and then chases him into the night. Interestingly, I followed up my viewing of this film with a 1939 Lux Radio Theater broadcast of the story, introduced by Cecille B. DeMille and once again starring Gable and Colbert. This recording can be found, if you're lucky, as a special feature on the 'It Happened One Night' DVD, and it's well worth a listen.  "
126845,tt0079470,ackstasis,australia,7,"Aha, what's so special about the cheesemakers?","I was flipping through DVDs for something to watch, and suddenly found myself humming ""Always Look on the Bright Side of Life"" ∂? so the decision was already made for me. 'Life of Brian (1979)' was the second of three original feature films by the Monty Python troupe (not counting 'And Now for Something Completely Different (1971)', which was a compilation of sketches from the TV show remade for theatrical consumption). The other two films ∂? 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975)' and 'The Meaning of Life (1983)' ∂? I'd watched back in 2006/2007, and found them not lacking in wry British humour, though I hardly considered them masterpieces of the highest order. I feel about the same about 'Life of Brian.' On the plus side, it really digs its heels into religion, with the crowds of Brian-worshipping disciples chasing the hapless hero (played by Graham Chapman) through the streets, interpreting his lost sandal as a divine gesture, and celebrating the presence of juniper berries as a miracle. The film is certainly less off-the-wall than 'Holy Grail,' with an abridged role for Terry Gilliam's distinctive animation, and fewer self-referential flourishes ∂? except for a bizarre Deus Ex Machina involving an alien spaceship that breaks Brian's tumble from a tall building. The two songs are fantastic, of course: the first a Bond-like ballad belted out with the bravado of Shirley Bassey, and the second a droll, cheery closer about the joys of accepting crucifixion.  "
128481,tt0074958,ackstasis,australia,8,What sort of script do you think we can make out of this?,"Perhaps it was a poor idea, prior to watching the film, to mentally link 'Network (1976)' with Alan J. Pakula's true story of newspaper journalism, 'All the President's Men (1976).' Whereas the latter is an absorbing dissection of the go-getters behind the written media, Lumet's film would probably feel more at home alongside 'Dr. Strangelove (1964),' an intelligent satire that occasionally oversteps the line of credibility, but, because we've gone with it this far, we're quite willing to take those few extra steps. The film is a stern indictment of the unscrupulous executives behind television, and also society's own obsession with mindless entertainment. Diana Christensen and Frank Hackett may very well be miserly, immoral reptiles, but it is ultimately their viewers, us, who drive their crooked dealings. Lumet delicately places the blame on his audience; we are the ""ratings"" for which the networks hunger so fanatically, and it is the crumbling state of our own culture that fuels absurd endeavours like ""The Howard Beale Show"" {thirty years on, I think we can all agree that things have only gotten worse}. A perfect example of the film's style of satire can be found early on, after veteran news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) learns that he is to be fired in two weeks' time, on account of poor ratings. The following evening, Beale calmly announces to millions of Americans his intentions to commit suicide on the air in a week's time. The show's technicians idly go about their duties, oblivious to what their star has just proclaimed, before one employee tentatively ventures, ""uh, did you hear what Howard just said?"" The network, in their ongoing quest for high ratings, was so blindly obsessed with perfecting all their technical aspects that the mental-derangement of their leading anchorman went almost completely unnoticed. At first, there is an attempt to yank Beale from the air, but one forward-thinking producer, Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway), proposes that the network could double their current ratings by keeping him in the spotlight. Peter Finch, who was awarded a posthumous Best Actor Oscar for his performance, is simply explosive as the unhinged anchorman whose volatile outbursts of derangement are celebrated by a society which, in a better world, should be trying to help him. Beale's memorable catch-cry ∂? ""I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!"" ∂? symbolises his revulsion towards the crumbling values of today's society, and, as fanatical as he might be, most of his raves are worryingly close to the truth. William Holden is also excellent as Max Schumacher, Beale's long-time colleague, who resents the networks' treatment of his friend, but does little to interfere. Schumacher's adulterous relationship with the seductive but soulless Diana (Dunaway) consciously follows the conventional path of a television soap opera, ending with the realisation that his affair with the ratings-obsessed mistress is sapping him of any real emotion or humanity; in Schumacher's own words, ""after living with you for six months, I'm turning into one of your scripts."" Television corrupts life.  "
128760,tt0046268,ackstasis,australia,8,"To get that bonus, they'll carry the entire charge on their backs","For a brief period during the 1950s, French director Henri-Georges Clouzot captured the mantle of ""The Master of Suspense"" from Alfred Hitchcock, owing mostly to his two most recognised thrillers, 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' It's a difficult title to live up to, but Clouzot knows precisely what he's doing, even if he seems to lack Hitchcock's distinctive sense of showmanship. What I've always loved about cinema is its ability to manipulate reality, to elicit genuine emotions from situations that, in real life, would seem mundane, or even ridiculous. An example I've used before, I believe, is Tarkovsky's 'Stalker (1979),' in which a peaceful and benign forest is inexplicably transformed into an environment of intense mystery and foreboding. Now consider 'The Wages of Fear,' when actor Peter van Eyck funnels what is probably water into a drilled hole in the rock. There's zero suspense in this simple act of pouring. However, taken within the context of the story, this water suddenly becomes nitroglycerine, and I got sore fingers from gripping the chair so tightly. 'The Wages of Fear' contains two particular sequences that rival anything Hitchcock ever did in terms of suspense. In the first, to which I briefly alluded above, a small amount of nitroglycerine is utilised to demolish a huge boulder blocking the road, the slightest lapse in concentration certain to lead to disaster. In the second, Mario (Yves Montand) and Jo (Charles Vanel) wallow pathetically in a deepening pool of crude oil, drowning in the black tar of America's capitalistic greed {the motif of oil epitomising greed is not an uncommon one in cinema, and most recently turned up in P.T. Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood (2006)'}. What I think prevents Clouzot's film from being truly brilliant is the opening half-hour or so, which is not only unsuspenseful, but damn near uninteresting. Of course, I suppose, it's important to note the changes that take place in the characters both before and after their new job ∂? the dominating Joe quickly reveals his cowardice, and the sycophantic Mario takes over the role of boss ∂? but Hitchcock, at least, would have made these introductions far more compelling. Towards the film's ending, I have conflicting emotions. On the one hand, it is a wonderful masterwork of cinematography and editing, as Mario's driving is intercut with the waltz of his acquaintances back in town, to the tune of Strauss' ""The Blue Danube."" There's an astonishing momentum to the camera movements; we foresee what is about to happen at least a minute before Montand's character does, but are powerless to stop it. He carries on his Dance Macabre (a figurative ""waltz with death"") until he loses control of the truck, begetting a spectacular, fiery plummet over the cliff edge. On the other hand, the entire incident ∂? however satisfying filmically ∂? doesn't seem like a natural progression of the narrative, possessing the air of a conclusion affixed only to achieve a surefire audience reaction. Unfortunately, similar cases of characters acting illogically litter the story, providing what might be described as mere cheap thrills: Mario continues to reverse the truck even after being told to stop, and Luigi, at one point, ludicrously decides to run towards an impending explosion rather than away from it.  "
129199,tt1130884,ackstasis,australia,9,"It's as if she evaporated, straight through the walls","Most psychological thrillers of late, stylistically, have been somewhat cold and clinical ∂? I'm thinking along the lines of Nolan's 'Memento (2000)' and Anderson's 'The Machinist (2004).' The last thriller I can recall with a dazzling colour palette was David Fincher's 'Se7en (1995).' Yet, compared to this film, 'Shutter Island (2010)' has an incredible gracefulness about it. Martin Scorsese has spoken many times of his love for Powell and Pressburger (particularly 'The Red Shoes (1948)'), and this film seems like a very deliberate, and worthy, attempt to mimic the lush visual style of Jack Cardiff's unforgettable Technicolor cinematography. There's a potential problem in painting a thriller film with such warm, inviting colours; the viewer is embraced, rather than repelled, by what he sees. This, however, is exactly what 'Shutter Island' aims for. The audience is thrust into the mind of Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio), and his perception of the world becomes our reality. Teddy Daniels is a Federal Marshall sent to an isolated Alcatraz-like penitentiary to investigate the disappearance of a female prisoner/mental patient. While battling personal demons of his own, Teddy must get to the bottom of an impossible mystery, all the while faced with hostility from the island authorities. A friend of mine noted that Scorsese was probably inspired by 'The Shining (1980),' and one might cite the use of Gy«Ùrgy Ligeti (one of Kubrick's composers of choice) as evidence for this. However, 'The Shining' was, stylistically, a cold and sterile film, John Alcott's cinematography eerily detached from the horrors perpetrated in the Overlook Hotel. No, Scorsese's primary inspiration was The Archers, and his use of lush, brooding colours and lighting is unforgettably atmospheric {perhaps the closest same-genre reference-point would be Roger Corman's Technicolor Poe adaptations, such as 'The Masque of the Red Death (1964)'}. Unfortunately, thanks to the inherent dangers of trawling the internet, I entered the film already aware of its ending. In any case, Scorsese seems uninterested in orchestrating the typical ""gotcha!"" narrative twist that is common to the genre. Even from the outset, the disturbance of the leading character is evident, the viewer frequently a party to his painful delusions. For most of the film's running time, we are quite happy to go along with Teddy, willing to believe his conspiracy theories. We expect to be deceived by the supporting characters, and resolve to see through their deceptions. Then something happens: the film tells us that we've been wrong, and we switch paths. All of a sudden, as he sat thoughtfully on the steps, I felt oddly distant from Teddy Daniels, his previously well-founded theories now dismissed as the musings of a mad-man. Are we, the audience, really that easy to sway? Have we just betrayed a perfectly sane man?  "
130063,tt0033870,ackstasis,australia,9,I don't mind a reasonable amount of trouble,"Nobody can be trusted. In the fast-talking, winner-take-all world of private investigation, you must always have eyes at the back of your head, otherwise, you'll wind up with bullets in your back. The overweight, conversational ""Fat Man"" (Sidney Greenstreet) has a few nasty tricks up his sleeve; the harmless-looking Joel Cairo (Peter Lorre) is determined to complete the task at hand; the frustrated hired hoodlum Wilmer (Elisha Cook, Jr.) knows how to hold a grudge; the deceptive femme fatale Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Mary Astor) speaks naught but lies. This is the seedy world of private dick Sam Spade (the one-and-only Humphrey Bogart), a man who is used to being in control, always cocky in the face of danger, and never afraid to do what it takes to unravel a case. 'The Maltese Falcon' was the second great debut of 1941 (after Orson Welles' effort, of course), and even today remains a gripping and unpredictable thriller, with a perfect cast, intelligent dialogue and a twisted, winding storyline that will keep you guessing until the very end. Just last night, I was fortunate enough to attend a double-bill cinema screening of 'The Maltese Falcon' and 'The Big Sleep (1946).' The screening was my second viewing for both films, and Hawks' film seemed to receive a stronger audience response. Though both pictures undoubtedly emerge from the same storytelling mould, borne from the hard-boiled fiction of Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, respectively, there are marked differences to be found in where each director places storytelling emphasis. Whereas 'The Big Sleep' wades determinedly through swathes of seedy characters, many faceless and unseen, John Huston is considerably more concise with regard to his characters and plot. Sam Spade's investigation revolves almost entirely around five central roles, close-knit acquaintances who are continually stabbing one another in the back. This degree of intimacy works well with the story, ensuring that each character has a well-developed personality and back-story to justify their behaviour through the film, however frequently they utilise lies and deception. 'The Maltese Falcon' is often cited as the first true film noir, which isn't entirely accurate. 'Stranger on the Third Floor (1940)' and 'High Sierra (1941)' more closely exhibit the sensibilities of the style, whereas Huston's film is strongly indebted to the pulp crime films of the 1930s, such as 'The Thin Man (1934)' {not coincidentally a Dashiell Hammett creation} and its sequels. Indeed, 'The Maltese Falcon' was in fact the third adaptation of Hammett's 1930 detective novel of the same, but it is generally considered to be the best of the three. What the film did contribute, however, is Mary Astor as the archetypal femme fatale, a lying dame whose rottenness is evident from the beginning, but whose charms are such that men are putty in her hands. The notion of a strong, independent heroine had grown in popularity throughout the thirties, and here it was turned against the usual male oppressor. In the film's cruel but justified ending, Spade acknowledges being influenced by O'Shaughnessy's allure, but ultimately reasserts his dominance by condemning her to prison despite his possible love for her.  "
132459,tt0053198,ackstasis,australia,8,Your parents say you're always lying,"I'm a little hesitant about rating and reviewing Fran«ıois Truffaut's 'The 400 Blows,' as my first viewing was a rather dysfunctional and muddled affair, one of those moments when you wish that DVD technology had never been invented as a substitute for the perfection of the cinema screen. A remarkable feature-length debut from the revered critic-turned-director, Truffaut's touching and funny portrait of juvenile angst proved one of the pioneering films in the French New Wave. Just a few days ago, I decided to attend my university's film society for a showing of the film, but, inconceivably and unforgivably, the screening was started a full thirty minutes into the picture, and, due to a wearisome technical fault, we missed a further ten minutes in the centre of the story, including the moment when young Antoine reveals himself to have never seen the ocean, a remark that proves extremely significant once we arrive at the conclusion. Fortunately, I had a copy of the film back at home, and promptly viewed the scenes that had been neglected, allowing me to better appreciate the intricate depths to which the film explored its characters and their respective situations. Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre L«∏aud) was born out of wedlock, and practically abandoned by his parents to live with relatives. After several years, Antoine returns to his resentful mother (Claire Maurier) and his kind, if inadequate, stepfather (Albert R«∏my) to hopefully commence a normal lifestyle, but, driven by the discomfort of his uneasy home relationships, Antoine descends into a life of mischief and petty crime. When his misbehavior becomes overwhelming for his strained parents, Antoine finds himself in a correctional facility for juvenile delinquents, and, despite the institute's strict disciplinary action, he still finds himself yearning for ""a life of his own,"" to be completely independent of his elders, and to live unrestrained by their narrow-minded restrictions. L«∏aud, in only his second film appearance, is wonderfully natural in the main role, portraying Antoine's tortured confinement ∂? stemming both from society's restrictive disciplinary system, and his stagnant family relationships ∂? with poignant, and often funny, enthusiasm. He would reunite with Truffaut on a further four occasions between 1962 and 1979 to complete the story of Antoine Doinel's life. There's little doubt that 'The 400 Blows' is at least partially autobiographical. Truffaut himself never knew his natural father, had a detached relationship with his mother and frequently found shelter in his love for cinema. During the film, Antoine discovers a passion for the French novelist and playwright Honor«∏ de Balzac, whose successful career was borne from a life plagued with personal and professional difficulties, his willful nature often squandering his attempts at business success. Always thirsting for independence from those who dictate rules to him, Antoine relates easily with Balzac, even building a candle-lit throne to the author, but his word-for-word ""homage"" is mistaken for plagiarism by his short-sighted school teacher. The film's final moments are rightfully celebrated for their touching and poignant ambiguity, as Antoine escapes from the juvenile institution and proceeds towards the ocean, which he has never seen before; his arrival at the rolling waves representative of that almost-unattainable independence of which he was so desirous. In a single, extremely smooth long-shot, Antoine ambles across the sand, always moving forward but seemingly getting nowhere. As he finally kicks at the breaking surf, Antoine pauses, perhaps uncertain of his path from here. Having acquired his goal of independence, he suddenly finds himself alone and purposeless, a small boy playing dolefully in the water. Antoine turns his back to the ocean and faces the audience directly {does he see his pursuers approaching in the distance?}, and the camera zooms in on a captured frame of Antoine's face, his soft, inquiring eyes asking us what he's supposed to do now.

133224,tt0060827,ackstasis,australia,7,"Your hiding place isn't watertight. Life trickles in from the outside, and you're forced to react.","Ingmar Bergman's 'Persona (1966)' opens with a bewildering montage of sounds and images, a frenzied newsreel of sex, death, cinema and comedy. The sequence is so far removed from my previous experience with the director that its effect is jarring, shocking; I momentarily wondered if I'd hit a wrong button and started playing Bu«Òuel's 'Un chien andalou (1929)' by mistake. I question Bergman's motives for including such an uncharacteristic opening, for it appears to have very little to do with the narrative that follows. Is this montage - an account of the sickening and concealed horrors and desires of society - a possible explanation for Elisabeth's continued silence? Even so, it all seems somewhat exploitative, as though Bergman was simply going for shock-value, obliterating any notions of subtlety with which I had begun to associate him {though I'll admit that the strength of 'The Seventh Seal (1957)' arose from its not-so-subtle representation of Death}. The opening scene concludes with a young boy awakening in the morgue, his hand outstretched towards the vague image of a woman's face. Elisabeth's unloved child? Alma's aborted fetus? An endless line of critics, it seems, have celebrated 'Persona' as a masterpiece, and among the greatest films ever made. I'd hate to be the lone voice of dissent, but the film is certainly the lesser of the three Bergmans I've hitherto seen, if only due to the noticeable absence of the good-natured humour to be found in both 'The Seventh Seal (1957)' and 'Wild Strawberries (1957)'. If, indeed, I were to describe 'Persona' as a masterpiece, it would be in regards to the visuals, which, photographed by long-time Bergman collaborator Sven Nykvist, are beyond description in their detail and intimacy. The film takes particular interest in the human face, and entire conversations of words and emotions are played out through the communication of the eyes, and the glimmering hint of a smile on the lips. There is one immortal moment in the film when Bergman juxtaposes the faces of each woman onto the screen, merging Elisabeth (Liv Ullmann) and Alma (Bibi Andersson) into a single entity. Persona also includes one of the most vivid depictions of sex that I've ever seen. Though the film shows us nothing, Alma's whispered description of an intimate encounter on the beach is staggering in its effectiveness; her words allow the viewer to formulate their own visuals, every emotion and nuance perfectly incorporated from the rich story we are being told. Though I may exhaust hours spouting the merits of Ingmar Bergman's film, I can't escape the fact that watching 'Persona' felt very much like a chore. The film boasts a relatively short running time, but it never seems to attain any comfortable sense of rhythm, and, by the film's end, I was left wondering just what the film was trying to get at. Bergman includes various allusions to Bertolt Brecht's ""Verfremdungseffekt"" effect ∂? highlighting the inherent artificiality of the cinematic medium ∂? with the film at one point appearing to burn; but, unlike in Fellini's '8∂´ (1963),' these self-referential flourishes seem to serve little foreseeable purpose. Am I looking too far into this film for meaning? Or am I not looking far enough? Even just hours afterwards, another layer of meaning has unfurled itself. Maybe it'll get better.  "
133412,tt0052618,ackstasis,australia,8,May God grant me vengeance,"Watching 'Ben-Hur (1959)' is a lot like paying a visit to the Colosseum. Situated in Rome, Italy, this massive elliptical amphitheatre is the largest ever built in the Roman Empire, able to seat up to 80,000 spectators for gladiatorial games and various public spectacles. I've never been to Rome myself, but I'd imagine that one would look up at this amazing feat of ancient architecture, and be left in awe at the scale of it all. You would marvel at the amount of care and labour that must have gone into such a project, particularly given the comparatively primitive tools with which the builders had worked. I feel the same way about 'Ben-Hur' ∂? William Wyler's epic of epics, and, at the time, the most expensive film ever made. Winner of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this colossal cinematic gamble resurrected M-G-M from financial ruin. But is it worth nearly four hours of your time? Like a lumbering elephant, 'Ben-Hur' wallows in its immensity, extravagance and self-importance. But it is epic ∂? oh, so very epic! ∂? and, like the Colosseum, demands our awe. Earlier this year, I decreed 'Ben-Hur' to be the one film that I wouldn't watch until I had the luxury of viewing it in the cinema. Sooner than expected, the opportunity came along, though the Christmas Eve screening date made it essential that I bring the usual holiday festivities forward one day. The sacrifice was much warranted, for this film can only be fully experienced in the theatre, not least because of the breathtaking 70mm anamorphic print, with an aspect ratio of 2.76:1 ∂? one of the widest ever made. William Wyler fills every frame with extravagance, such that even the quietest person-to-person conversation takes place in a magnificent, lavishly-decorated chamber. Such expansive surroundings often promote coldness and detachedness from the audience (many uninvolving historical epics were produced around this period), and 'Ben-Hur' doesn't entirely escape the same fate; for every exciting and emotional sequence, there are maybe two scenes of negligible exposition. But the film thrives on its excesses, and, fortunately, the good scenes are so incredibly good that they merit the wait. Charlton Heston won an Oscar for his portrayal of Judah Ben-Hur, though his performance is merely adequate without being particularly brilliant. Heston, an actor who flourished mostly on sheer charisma, I think, appears to struggle in the film's most emotional moments {my personal pick for the award that year would have been Laurence Harvey in Jack Clayton's 'Room at the Top (1959)'}. Stephen Boyd, though un-nominated, is quite terrific as Messala, Judah's boyhood friend who was later corrupted by the evils of the Roman Empire. Though there are many exciting scenes ∂? such as the fiery ocean battle or Christ's crucifixion ∂? the film's undisputed centrepiece is, of course, the extraordinary chariot race, a marvel of adrenalin-charged action and suspense. Every single metre of the contest had me enthralled, every jolt and tremble of the carriage sending an agitated chill down my spine. The sequence's enduring influence is to be found in practically every historical epic that followed, most noticeably Ridley Scott's Best Picture-winning 'Gladiator (2000).' To be denied one's name is the film's greatest tragedy. When condemned to a lifetime of slavery aboard a Roman galley, Judah loses his important status and is delegated a generic identification number ∂? #41. His mother and sister, having contracted leprosy after years in confinement, later flee to a leper colony, where, we are told, names are of no use. After being liberated from captivity by the kindly nobleman Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), Judah takes on the name of his newly-adopted father, a compassionate gesture but one that he is later ashamed to have accepted. To be denied one's face, on the other hand, is apparently divine. Claude Heater, as Jesus Christ, is never properly seen, glimpsed only from behind or at a distance. In this way, the Messiah is portrayed as something holy and angelic, not to be glimpsed by mortal eyes. Though the story of Christ may only form a subplot, thematically it sits at the film's heart. 'Ben-Hur' is about the beginnings of Christianity, and how its teachings have inspired people from the very beginning, and ever since.  "
136922,tt0052311,ackstasis,australia,8,A policeman's job is only easy in a police state,"Orson Welles was undoubtedly one of the finest filmmakers of the twentieth century, and yet the entire span of his career carried with it an air of tragedy. Knowing exactly what he wanted in his films, Welles frequently stood on the toes of studio executives, usually unsuccessfully, and most of his pictures were eventually cut and re-cut into completely different entities. By the end of his career, studios were refusing to fund any of his films, numerous projects were abandoned and Welles' lingering cinematic genius went to waste. With the exception of 'The Magnificent Ambersons (1942),' 'Touch of Evil (1958)' is the director's most famous butchered masterpiece. Furious with the alterations that had been made to his work, Welles wrote a 58-page memo highlighting the changes he would like to see made. It was not until 1998 that a ""director's cut"" based upon Welles' wishes was edited and released, and this is the version that I have just enjoyed, considered definitive by most Wellsians. Additionally, I was lucky enough to experience the film in the cinema, in a classic double-bill with Carol Reed's 'The Third Man (1949).' Welcome to Los Robles, a small town on the border of Mexico and the United States. As by-the-book Mexican narcotics cop Mike Vargas (Charlton Heston) explains, ""all border towns bring out the worst in a country."" Drugs, alcohol and firearms do a steady trade; greed and corruption stretches to the very heights of law enforcement. Police Captain Hank Quinlan (Orson Welles) is the most respected American detective in the region, but he is as corrupt as the criminals whom he puts behind bars daily. Unshaven, obese, obsessed and arrogant, Quinlan boasts no redeeming qualities, a stupid and dangerous hunk of flesh. He is truly a formidable villain, and perhaps one of the finest that I have seen in a film: he's Harry Lime without the likable boyish charisma. However, and herein lies the dilemma, Quinlan is one helluva good detective, and his procedures, however dubious, often get the job done. But is it acceptable to convict even a guilty criminal based on fabricated evidence, or does this make Quinlan the worst criminal of all? After a home-made bomb tears apart the vehicle of a wealthy American businessman (via an astonishing uninterrupted three-minute crane tracking shot), Detective Vargas offers his aid in solving the crime. He is currently on a honeymoon with his newly-married American wife, Susie (Janet Leigh), but his job appears to be a priority to him, and he is often neglectful of the women he loves. Few are enthusiastic about having a Mexican's help in the case, and Vargas' involvement will later lead Quinlan to cross the line between dishonesty and pure evil. Filmed as a B-movie on a B-movie budget (Welles was paid meager $125,000 for his writing, acting and directorial duties, only to have his film butchered by the producers), 'Touch of Evil' exploits its low-budget roots for maximum shock value, inviting the audience into a highly-exaggerated, unrelentingly-sinister web of deceit, lies, betrayal and murder. Almost every supporting character ∂? from the bulging Quinlan to the sleazy, slimy Mexican drug-lords of the Grandi family ∂? have not a redeeming value to their characters. Commentaries on 'Touch of Evil,' even the overwhelmingly positive ones, find it obligatory to include a snide remark on Charlton Heston's unsuitability for the role. I had no such qualms. Having seen fewer Heston films than I'd like to admit, and so being unacquainted with his all-American image, I found him quite believable as the Mexican Mike Vargas, his unflinching moral determination often leading him to abandon his damsel-in-distress wife when she most needs him. Orson Welles, his already-wide girth complemented by large amounts of padding and low-angle cinematography, is a genuinely menacing antagonist, especially when one considers a distant past when Quinlan must have been an honest detective. The Police Captain's long-time partner and good friend, Pete Menzies (Joseph Calleia) grovels admiringly at the feet of his superior, a somewhat pathetic devotee ∂? forced to risk everything for the sake of his duty to the law ∂? who ultimately lends an air of dignity to the parade of dark characters. Charlton Heston wasn't far off the mark when he described 'Touch of Evil' as ""the greatest B-movie ever made."" The film does, indeed, descend into subject matter of such squalor and revulsion that it seems the work of a filmmaker outside the polished Hollywood studio system. Nevertheless, the film is also the work of a consummate professional, with outstanding camera-work that often employs smoothly-shot long-takes. It's this contrast that I find most interesting about the film: Welles is utilising stylish and classy artistry to capture an environment completely devoid of style or class, a retched and depraved community of low-lives and petty criminals, drugs and sex, murder and corruption. This raw pulpiness, momentarily realised in the open minutes of Aldrich's 'Kiss Me Deadly (1955),' is here brought to its apex. Welles' film, though completely overlooked at the 1959 Academy Awards, has since developed the status of a classic, and is perhaps his most celebrated film after his extraordinary 1941 debut, 'Citizen Kane.' It was also the last film that the director would complete in Hollywood.  "
137351,tt0079944,ackstasis,australia,8,The Zone wants to be respected. Otherwise it will punish.,"Like a solemn and reflective piece of poetry, Andrei Tarkovsky's 'Stalker' moves forward slowly. Though loosely based on an undeniable straight science-fiction novel, 'Roadside Picnic' by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, the film is less concerned with science than it is with pondering the philosophical and metaphysical notions of personal faith and desire. 'Stalker' was released in 1979 after a trouble-plagued production, during which vast portions of the film had to be re-shot due to errors during negative development, and amidst crumbling relations with the original cinematographer, Georgi Rerberg. Most of the film takes place in a wilderness area cordoned off by the government, known as ""The Zone."" Strictly guarded by armed soldiers who fear to enter it, The Zone is believed to have been the site of a meteor strike, a nuclear accident or even a UFO landing (as in the original novel). One man, known as Stalker (Aleksandr Kajdanovsky), living in a grey and dreary town on the outskirts of The Zone, makes a living out of leading men into the perilous heart of the area, specifically to a room with the alleged ability to grant a man's most innermost desires. On this occasion, against the wishes of his wife (Alisa Frejndlikh), Stalker accompanies two men into The Zone, respectively known as Writer (Anatoli Solonitsyn) ∂? a skeptical author looking for inspiration ∂? and Professor (Nikolai Grinko) ∂? a man of science with ambiguous motives. Once they have bypassed the armed security on the outskirts of the area, Stalker informs his clients that they are to obey his every command if the three of them are to avoid the unspeakable perils of The Zone. These dangers do not appear immediately obvious, with the vast surrounding landscape seemingly peaceful and serene, with the quiet calls of birds and insects occasionally pierced by the distant howl of a wolf or dog. Indeed, it is here that Stalker appears to find complete and utter solace, stretching himself amongst the thickly-scented vegetation to absorb the sights, sounds and smells of the only place that makes him feel human. Writer is initially quite skeptical of the so-called dangers of The Zone, but Stalker's passionate pleas for cooperation eventually convince him to do as he is told. The characters make their journey to The Room slowly, sometimes infuriatingly so, but there is always an underlying sense of peril with every tentative step that they take. Out of a seemingly peaceful and benign environment, Tarkovsky has inspired foreboding. The slow and deliberate pacing of the film most certainly plays a part in this. Tarkovsky's characteristically long takes, coupled with the slow and subtle movement of the camera, successfully create a dream world, a perspective of the story that appears far removed from reality. The trio's journey towards The Room is not so much a journey into the heart of the forest, but a journey into the very depths of the human mind. Softly shot in a sort of dreary metallic sepia, 'Stalker' is a surprisingly beautiful film to look at. Through his extended takes ∂? some as long as six minutes in length ∂? Tarkovsky leaves every image on screen long enough, not just for us to notice it, but for its beauty to inspire, to inhabit us. Tarkovsky notably despised the use of quick cuts or montage to achieve artificial dramatic peaks, and, at 163 minutes, 'Stalker' is not the most accessible of films. Admittedly, I did catch myself sneaking a glance at my clock on a couple of occasions, but, once we reached that breathtaking conclusion, I couldn't help but think that the entire journey was very much worthwhile.  "
138005,tt0075686,ackstasis,australia,9,That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing,"Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is something of a hopeless romantic. A cynical, death-obsessed New York Jewish comedian, Singer has never been able to maintain a steady relationship with a woman. He has been married twice, and divorced twice. He broke up with one woman because of their disagreements over the ""second shooter"" conspiracy of John F. Kennedy's assassination, or perhaps that was just his excuse. To paraphrase Freud, possibly Groucho Marx, he simply ""would never want to belong to any club that would accept someone like him for a member."" He doesn't drive because he is paranoid about driving; he has been seeing a psychiatrist for the past fifteen years, though these appointments were long ago reduced to simple ""whining"" sessions. There is an inherent uncertainty in everything that Singer says ∂? as though he really knows what he's talking about, but he can't convince himself that he's got it right. When he accompanies a friend (Tony Roberts) to a tennis game, Singer's first and foremost concern is that the club will deny him entry because he's a Jew. However, that fateful game serves forth something so much more significant and life-changing ∂? he comes to meet the ditsy and exuberant Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Despite clearly having very little in common, something clicks between the two eligibles, and they embark on a tumultuous years-long relationship that will inevitably fail to materialise into anything further. Erupting with clever dialogue and witty cultural references, 'Annie Hall's' script is one of the best you'll ever see. Not only is the conversation entertaining to listen to, but ∂? even with all the talking to the camera and interacting with random extras ∂? it actually manages to seem startlingly realistic. This is no small thanks, of course, to the main actors, who embody their characters so perfectly that we're unsure if they are acting or merely playing themselves. Though he had previously released a few well-received, light-hearted affairs, it was 'Annie Hall' that blasted writer/actor/director Woody Allen into the realms of super-stardom. In an uncharacteristic move for the Academy, Allen's film won four 1978 Oscars, including Best Actress (Keaton), Best Original Screenplay (Allen, Marshall Brickman), Best Director (Allen) and Best Picture ∂? not undeservedly, though millions of 'Star Wars' fans would, I'm sure, disagree. Having revisited 'Annie Hall' for the first time in a year, having since enjoyed many of Allen's other films, I am genuinely amazed at his transition from silly comedian to insightful observer on human relationships. Of course, a noticeable evolution in his film-making style is evident in both the science-fiction 'Sleeper (1973)' and the Russian historical spoof 'Love and Death (1975),' but neither boasts the the intelligence nor the sophistication of this film, which wholly discards the Chaplin-like slapstick of Allen's previous films and adopts the Tracy-Hepburn screwball comedy of a decade later. Originally slated ∂? and filmed, in fact ∂? as a New York murder mystery with a romantic sub-plot, 'Annie Hall' was taken by editor Ralph Rosenbaum and cut down (massacred, if you will) into the modern, witty 1970s screwball comedy that we still enjoy today. It is truly amazing that such an extensive post-production reshaping had no obvious ill effects upon the general flow of the film, though the structure in itself is so hectic that we probably wouldn't notice it, anyway: Allen frequently cuts forwards and backwards in time, his modern characters are able to revisit and discuss the past, characters in split screens interact, Allen regularly breaks the ""fourth wall"" and addresses the audience directly. Some of the discarded murder mystery elements from 'Annie Hall' were later incorporated into another Allen film, 'Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993),' which also co-starred Keaton. Aside from Allen and Keaton, numerous smaller roles provide a crucial framework for the overall structure of the film. Tony Roberts is Rob, Singer's old friend and confidant. Paul Simon (of Simon and Garfunkel) plays a record producer who takes a keen interest in both Annie and her singing. Shelley Duvall is a reporter for 'The Rolling Stone' magazine, and a one-time girlfriend of Singer. There are also tiny early roles for Christopher Walken (as Annie's somewhat disturbed brother), Jeff Goldblum (who speaks one memorable line at a party ∂? ""Hello? I forgot my mantra"") and Sigourney Weaver (who can be briefly glimpsed as Singer's date outside a theatre). Two slightly more unusual cameos come from Truman Capote (as a Truman Capote-lookalike, no less) and scholar Marshall McLuhan (whom Singer suddenly procures from behind a movie poster to declare to a talkative film-goer that ""you know nothing of my work!""). Easily the most innovative and energetic of the films I've so far seen from Woody Allen, 'Annie Hall' is a spirited glimpse at the incompatibility of human beings, and a cynical yet bittersweet meditation on the falsity of the perfect romantic Hollywood ending. It is also a considerable comedic achievement, and Allen would repeatedly recycle his trademark neurotic New Yorker screen persona, most notably in 'Manhattan (1979),' but never with more success than this premium outing in excellence. The engagingly-convoluted storyline moves with such briskness that you don't realise just how very little happens, and that, by the film's end, our characters are exactly where they were at the beginning. Nevertheless, Allen manages to say something significant about human relationships ∂? they're totally irrational, crazy and absurd, but we keep attempting them because of what they give us in return. Or, at least, what we think they give us.  "
140252,tt0046911,ackstasis,australia,8,Don't you believe in Hell?,"For a brief period during the 1950s, French director Henri-Georges Clouzot temporarily swiped the title of ""The Master of Suspense"" from Alfred Hitchcock, owing to a string of well-received suspense thrillers, most notably 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' The latter was an adaptation of the novel ""Celle qui n'«∏tait plus (She Who Was No More)"" by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac; it was released in the UK as 'The Devils,' and in the United States as 'Diabolique.' Upon its initial release, the film was extensively likened to the work of Hitchcock {who, popular legend tells us, missed out on purchasing the novel rights by a mere few hours}, with its slow-burning, deliberately-paced suspense, and a shocking twist that I never for a moment saw coming. Though, with the notable exception of two scenes ∂? both involving a murder, with only one of them being real ∂? the film isn't particularly scary, the tension, the paranoia and the blackened shadows often become overwhelming, and Clouzot deftly toes the line between supernatural evil, and the evil that lurks within all of us. Christina Delassalle (V«∏ra Clouzot) and Nicole Horner (Simone Signoret), both teachers at a boarding school for young boys, have a rather peculiar friendship. Christina is married to Michel (Paul Meurisse), a violent and tyrannical husband who derives pleasure from humiliating his pretty but physically-delicate wife. Nicole, conversely, is Michel's mistress, a proud and independent woman who knows how to take control of a situation. At one point in the film, upon witnessing the two woman quietly conversing, a fellow professor makes a fascinated remark: ""I may be reactionary, but this is absolutely astounding - the legal wife consoling the mistress! No, no, and no!"" The mere fact that Christina and Nicole have become close should already hint at a sinister situation underlying the surface, and, indeed, it is soon revealed that the two women plan to murder Michel and ridding themselves of his oppression. The ""murder"" itself ∂? a sedative in the alcohol, and drowning their unconscious victim in the bathtub, is exceedingly disturbing, as we guiltily and uneasily ask ourselves if we'd have the courage to carry through such a scheme. Alfred Hitchcock often delighted in creating suspense through the audience's subversive empathy for a film's villain, as a murderer attempts frantically to remove all traces of their crime. Clouzot uses a similar technique in his film, though, given the loathsome nature of the murder victim, our sympathy for the two women is almost demanded of us. However, the disappearance of Michel's body from the school swimming pool is completely unexpected, and either hints at a supernatural overtone, or that somebody else is quite obviously aware of their terrible crime. The paranoia from here rarely lets up, and we continually bombard ourselves with an endless stream of questions, unable to provide an answer for any of them. On a weaker note, despite the ever-present air of tension, few scenes actually succeeded in getting my heart pumping at a mile-a-minute, which was a slightly disappointing response that I can't quite explain. Perhaps a few sequences need to have been shortened slightly, just to swipe off ten unnecessary minutes, and allowing for a brisker pace that never gives you a chance to exhale.  "
142913,tt0056801,ackstasis,australia,8,It's better to destroy than create what's unnecessary.,"Federico Fellini's '8∂´' is one of the most celebrated films of all time, hailed as an undisputed masterpiece by all who watch it. I wanted to love it. I wanted to love it as one loves a son, but this simply was not to be∂? at least, not yet. There is certainly much to be admired about the film, but I never made that emotional connection with the characters and events, constantly feeling as though I was merely an outsider staring in at a movie. Perhaps, with its self-referential nature and its frequent unannounced lapses into memory and fantasy, this wasn't the ideal Fellini film for my first foray into his work. Nonetheless, rather than putting me off the director, '8∂´' has rather whet my appetite to see more of his films. The partly-autobiographical plot revolves around an Italian film director, Guido Anselmi (Marcello Mastroianni), who is supposed to be producing an epic science-fiction film but is experiencing a debilitating bout of ""director's block."" At the same time, Guido is also battling momentous marital problems, trying (and failing) to sustain a working relationship with both his wife, Luisa (Anouk Aim«∏e), and his mistress, Carla (Sandra Milo). With nervous producers constantly pressuring him from all sides, Guido is unable to cope with everything in his life, frequently shifting between reality, fantasies and vivid childhood memories. There are certainly many things to love about '8∂´.' The autobiographical element of the film was fascinating, and perhaps even an accurate depiction of the psychological barriers faced by a celebrated director whose every picture is expected to be a masterpiece. The film, courtesy of some imaginative cinematography and fast-paced editing, is energetic, dazzling and colourful (if this can be said of a black-and-white film), and there is a healthy combination of reality and dream sequences, and instances when the line between the two is blurred. The acting is excellent all round, with Mastroianni delivering a particularly excellent performance as the trouble-plagued director. But∂? what is the meaning behind it all? It is likely that Fellini was perfectly aware of his film's ""shortcomings"" (if you were inclined to call it that), for he introduced the character of Carini (Jean Rougeul), who frequently appears to harshly critique Guido's script, highlighting the issues that a critic might raise about Fellini's own film: ""you see, what stands out at a first reading {viewing} is the lack of a central issue or a philosophical stance∂? That makes the film a chain of gratuitous episodes which may even be amusing in their ambivalent realism. You wonder, what is the director really trying to do? Make us think? Scare us?"" In doing so, Fellini cleverly stays one step ahead of his critics, whom I'm sure would be in the vast minority. However, does acknowledging the potential flaws of your own movie somehow exclude it from that same criticism? Of course, this is left purely up to the individual viewer. Though '8∂´' is beautifully envisioned and executed, I never really felt part of the film I was watching. It really had a cold and sterile tone to it, and even the dream sequences ∂? during which we are supposed to be inside the main protagonist's head ∂? felt distant and impersonal. Nonetheless, even just the technical brilliance of '8∂´' is enough to win my respect, and, like most great films, I'm sure that a repeat viewing will prove infinitely useful. I can't yet say that it is a masterpiece, but perhaps time will change my mind∂?  "

Too often in cinema, the end of the battle is considered the end of the war: a sweeping camera movement, an upwelling of stirring music, the hurrah of victorious soldiers, and suddenly everything is all right. But war doesn't end when the guns stop blazing, nor when the politicians put their pens to paper. War lingers for days, months, and years. Returning veterans, even those who emerged from conflict without a scratch, faced an uphill battle to reclaim their former lives, having sacrificed their happiest years in service to their country. In 1946, the issues faced by war veterans had only just come to public light. 1944 saw the introduction of the G.I. Bill, which allowed ex-serviceman access to low-interest loans with which to rebuild their lives. Post-traumatic stress disorder in soldiers had previously only been explored in the film noir 'The Blue Dahlia (1946).' Three soldiers from different social classes, returning to their home- town after years of conflict, are united in their desire to rekindle their former lives. But things will never be the same as before. Homer Parrish (true-life war veteran Harold Russell) lost his hands in battle, and fears that his faithful girlfriend (Cathy O'Donnell) remains with him only out of pity. Working-class pilot Fred Derry (Dana Andrews) finds that, despite his distinguished achievements in war-time, he still lacks the necessary experience to assimilate into civilian life. Al Stephenson (Fredric March) returns to children he barely recognises, but finds consolation in ""the perfect wife"" Myrna Loy. The intertwining journeys faced by each of the veterans are often uncomfortable to watch, sometimes shameful and embarrassing, but the overriding message is one of hope: whatever adversities these men must confront, they can be sure to rely upon the support of their family, friends and the grateful United States government. Gregg Toland's crisp deep-focus photography is excellent, but the major strength in William Wyler's drama are the characters themselves. Harold Russell, who actually did lose his hands in combat, was hand-picked from a military documentary on rehabilitated soldiers, and his performance works so well because it's genuine. Russell is clearly an amateur next to the neatly-balanced dramatics of March and Andrews ∂? he even flubs his characters' wedding vows ∂? but the emotion is authentic, and his pain heartbreaking. Fredric March won his second Oscar (after 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931)') for his role as a banker who lost his commercial hardness in the trenches. A little disappointingly, his character doesn't figure prominently in the film's second half, his role somewhat reduced to that of a vector facilitating Andrews' melodramatic, but satisfying, romance with Teresa Wright. I would have liked the film to have more thoroughly explored Stephenson's detached relationship with his children, but evidently there were time constraints to be considered ∂? having said that, though, the 172 minutes flies by effortlessly.

However, I couldn't do so until I had seen the 2002 Hong Kong film upon which it was based, 'Mou gaan dou {Infernal Affairs},' directed by Wai-keung Lau and Siu Fai Mak. Fortunately, not too long ago, my local movie rental store was having a sale on their superfluous VHS tapes, at a price of $2.00 apiece. Among the cheap movies that I snapped up was a copy of 'Infernal Affairs' that looked like it had never been opened. Having now watched it, I must say that, despite my limited experience with Asian cinema, I very much enjoyed the film. 'Infernal Affairs' combines an irresistible story of intrigue, loyalty and betrayal with some extremely slick editing and camera-work; it's no surprise that the film has acquired an impressive following in the West. Tony Leung plays Chan Wing Yan, an overwrought undercover cop who has spent the last ten years infiltrating numerous dangerous gangs and exposing their criminal dealings. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Andy Lau plays Inspector Lau Kin Ming, a police mole who is secretly working the Triad, the same gang with which Yan is currently affiliated. After an expensive drugs transaction goes wrong for both the gang and the police force, each side suspects that they have a traitor in their midst, and, in a bitterly ironic turn, it falls to each of the two moles to find out who it is. Both main actors do a good job of maintaining the intensity of the story. There are certainly countless parallels to be drawn between the characters, but what struck me most were the contrasts between the two: Ming is a cold, devoted and ruthlessly efficient, whilst Yan has been reduced to a tired and neurotic wreck after a decade of living in fear. The plot of 'Infernal Affairs' moves forward at a ripper pace, probably owing more to Western action cinema than that from its own region. The cinematography is bright and stylish, and the climactic scene on the rooftop, with the vibrant sunlight beaming overhead, was captured to great effect {Australian-born Christopher Doyle, who has worked on such films as '2046' and 'Rabbit-Proof Fence,' contributed to this film, so you already know that the cinematography will be good}. There are several moments when the storytelling was not handled as well as it might have been: the film made too frequent use of unnecessary flashbacks, and, following the death of Superintendent Wong (Anthony Wong), we are treated to a video montage that feels like the final episode of a long-running sitcom. Also, the failed attempts of Ming's wife to finish her novel (""I don't know whether he's good or bad"") was a blatantly-obvious attempt to draw parallels with Andy Lau's character. Despite my trivial complaints, 'Infernal Affairs' is an entertaining and thrilling film that I'd certainly recommend to anyone.  "

This should give you some idea of the picture's startling documentary-realism. It's plain that director Gillo Pontecorvo began his career producing documentaries, and it is thoroughly exciting to see him exploit his knowledge of the medium to achieve incredible resonance through its brutal and frank depiction of an anti-colonial revolution. There are countless moments when you could swear that Pontecorvo made use of historical footage; surely such a passionate rally comprising hundreds of people could not be recreated so flawlessly for the screen. The camera sits amid the protesting civilians, is jostled by the crowd, reacts frantically to the spatter of machine gun fire, and trembles with each horrific street bombing. Accompanying these images booms a suspenseful musical score, composed by both the director and the great Ennio Morricone. 'The Battle of Algiers' recreates the Algerian War of Independence, from November 1954 to December 1960, focusing entirely on the capital city of Algiers. Unsatisfied with remaining a colony of France, a selection of determined civilians (Brahim Hagiag, Yacef Saadi ∂? the latter playing a fictional version of himself) form the National Liberation Front (FLN), who sought to reclaim their independence through acts of terrorism and bloody violence. The escalating bloodshed leads to the introduction of French paratroopers, led by Colonel Mathieu (believed to be a combination of real-life officers Colonel Bigeard and General Massu, and played by Jean Martin). In a bid to combat the frequent street-bombs and police officer shootings, Mathieu employs any possible means, including lynch mobs, murder and harrowing methods of torture. The colonel's justification for ordering these acts is chillingly simple: ""should we remain in Algeria? If you answer ""yes,"" then you must accept all the necessary consequences."" Another element for which 'The Battle of Algiers' has been praised is its relative lack of bias. Though the end of the film betrays an unmistakable support for the rebels' cause (an unsurprising outcome considering that it was partially funded by the Algerian government), it is often difficult to decide for which side you should show sympathy. Perhaps it was just my post-September 11/Bali bombings mentality coming through, but, having entered the film without any background knowledge, I spent much of it cheering for the charismatic Col. Mathieu and his paratroopers, hoping that they'd quickly and efficiently destroy those cowardly, caf«∏-bombing terrorists. Unlike other seemingly-similar revolution pictures (such as Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925)'), 'The Battle of Algiers' doesn't attempt to push any clear agenda: every character on each side possesses a staunch inability to accept defeat; every character achieves great things and every character commits acts of violence too horrifying to even imagine. There are no clear-cut heroes and villains here; everybody is a hero and everybody is a villain. This is the way that life is. This is a revolution at its most truthful.  "

However, from the moment that Sonny Wortzik (Al Pacino) and Sal Naturile (John Cazale) step into the Chase Manhattan Bank in Brooklyn, New York City, their well-laid plans begin to unfurl. Within just minutes, the bank is surrounded by a ""militia"" of policemen and FBI agents, accompanied by a curious crowd of onlookers and a scurry of eager television journalists. With nine hostages as his only bargaining tools, Sonny must think of a way of getting himself and Sal out of this situation alive and free. But has he already come too far? 'Dog Day Afternoon' is based on a real-life incident. On August 22 1972, John Wojtowicz, Salvatore Antonio Naturile and a third unknown accomplice attempted to rob a bank on the corner of East Third Street and Avenue P in Gravesend, Brooklyn. The eventual result of the real-life siege is best left unknown for those who are yet to see the film, but certainly director Sidney Lumet and screenwriter Frank Pierson took a certain artistic license with some of the film's events, which have been described by one significant person at the scene as ""only 30% true."" Nonetheless, this very same person praised the performances of Al Pacino and Chris Sarandon (as Sonny's ""wife,"" Leon) as being accurate. Al Pacino is superb in this movie. Fresh off the phenomenal success of 'The Godfather (1972),' 'Serpico (1973)' and 'The Godfather: Part 2 (1974),' Pacino truly was on his way to becoming one of the most outstanding performers of his generation, and his turn as Sonny Wortzik is most definitely no exception. Strong performances from his 'Godfather' co-star John Cazale, Chris Sarandon, Charles Durning, James Broderick and Sully Boyar make this a solidly-acted film. Lumet's decision to keep the film largely free of any musical score was a good decision, and certainly added to the realism of the plot. However, the one exception ∂? Elton John's 'Amoreena' during the opening credits ∂? simply didn't sit well with the tone of the remainder of the film, and he would probably have been best to leave it out. Also, though many of the film's scenes prove extremely riveting, there were certainly times when I noticed my attention somewhat wavering. Sonny's lengthy (and apparently improvised) telephone conversation with his ""wife"" Leon was one example of this ∂? though it was definitely important to the story, and certainly showed off the skills of the two actors involved, I simply thought that it brought the film's steadily mounting suspense to a grinding halt.  "
149660,tt0041546,ackstasis,australia,8,It is so difficult to make a neat job of killing people with whom one is not on friendly terms.,"Though it had been producing films since the 1930s, it wasn't until 1949 that Ealing Studios finally commenced its golden period. In was in this year that they released the first batch of their most entertaining comedies, including Alexander Mackendrick's 'Whisky Galore! (1949),' Henry Cornelius' 'Passport to Pimlico (1940),' Charles Frend's 'A Run for Your Money (1949)' {a little-known gem of which I'm very fond} and, of course, Robert Hamer's 'Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949),' which launched Alec Guinness into a successful career with the studio. Easily one of the darkest comedies of its era, Hamer's film was loosely adapted from the novel ""Israel Rank,"" by Roy Horniman ∂? among other changes, the main character was renamed from Israel Rank to Louis Mazzini, to avoid any perceived anti-Semitism so soon after World War Two. The title itself was derived from an 1842 poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson, which reads, in part: ""Kind hearts are more than coronets, and simple faith than Norman blood."" The films of Ealing Studios can often be characterised as good-natured, down-to-earth comedy offerings, light-hearted in tone and always steering towards the attainment of community betterment; characters typically conclude the film having learned a valuable lesson, and the ending is usually most ideal for all concerned. Later films such as 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951)' and especially 'The Ladykillers (1955)' returned to the murky themes of Hamer's film, but they couldn't avoid reinforcing the age-old adage that ""crime doesn't pay,"" whereas this comedy leaves ample room for the possibility of our killer escaping scot-free {however, for audiences across the Atlantic, the Production Code dictated that this ambiguity be removed}. Likely influenced by Charles Chaplin's 'Monsieur Verdoux (1947)' ∂? a ""comedy of murders"" ∂? Hamer unwaveringly filled his film to the brim with dark themes, dry wit and bitter irony, finding a hilariously suave and classy serial killer in actor Dennis Price, whose unflinching murderous plight attains a twisted sense of empathy through the maltreatment of his mother's memory at the hands of the D'Ascoyne family. I've often remarked that Alec Guinness never plays the same role twice, his character changing unrecognisably from picture to picture. In the case of this film, he virtually changes from scene to scene, portraying all eight heirs to the Dukedom of Chalfont with uproarious charisma and versatility. It helps that most of Guinness' creations, merely targets for the conniving Louis Mazzini, are wholly unlikable or frustratingly senile, though there's certainly a pang of regret when the amiable photography hobbyist is murdered, and the manner in which The Duke is dispatched is shocking in its sheer cold-bloodedness. Perhaps a single complaint is that the murders of Lady Agatha and the General were skipped over much too quickly, and I would have enjoyed a more in-depth examination of the mechanics of the crime. The final act of the film is swathed in a healthy dose of irony, as Mazzini is arrested and charged for the one murder he didn't commit, his fate sealed and then rescued by his jilted mistress, Sibella (Joan Greenwood), who alone guesses the truth about what he has done.

Though I had caught a brief glimpse of her in the Ealing comedy 'The Lavender Hill Mob (1951),' I had not yet seen a film featuring the lovely Audrey Hepburn. Indeed, prior to the release of William Wyler's 1953 romantic comedy, 'Roman Holiday,' neither had most American audiences. The role proved one of cinema's most astounding breakthroughs, and, not only did the film receive three Oscars from ten nominations, but among the wins was Audrey Hepburn for Best Actress in a Leading Role. Despite a considerable age difference between the two leading performances {13 years separated Hepburn and Gregory Peck, already considered an acting veteran} the romantic chemistry between the two stars works faultlessly, and the manner in which Joe Bradley's relationship with Princess Ann gradually transforms from frustration to exploitation to love is so incredibly natural that it must represent one of the finest romances of the 1950s - a lovely ""backwards"" Cinderella story. Princess Ann (Hepburn) is a royal princess from an unspecified European country. Her past weeks have been dedicated to a gruelling, highly-publicised tour of European capital cities, her every minute tightly scheduled. For the duration of her travels, Ann has been forced to maintain the pretense of an elegant, proper monarch, her time expended on tedious official duties. In an excruciating opening dance sequence, which is later contrasted with the jovial celebrations aboard the barge on the Tiber River, Ann is forced to waltz with a progressively older selection of male dignitaries, each more unattractive than the last. Though we're not explicitly told the princess' age {Hepburn was 24 years old at the time, though her character tries to pass herself off as a school student}, such a lifestyle is understandably ill-suited to such a beautiful young lady. One night, after being given a sedative to quell her restlessness, Ann secretly escapes from her country's embassy and decides to enjoy a stroll through colourful Rome. A gruff newspaper journalist, Joe Bradley (Peck), finds her sleeping on a street bench, and begrudgingly takes her back to his apartment. 'Roman Holiday' really hits its stride in the second act, once Joe has discovered the Princess' true identity and decides to exploit her innocence for the purposes of an exclusive story. Photojournalist Irving Radovich (Oscar-nominated Eddie Albert, whose performance struck me as surprisingly modern) is dragged along to secretly take photographs, but his apparent inability to take a hint leads to the systematic destruction of his clean clothes. The final touching scene, in which the pair communicate their love and respect for one another through official allusion {""By all means, Rome. I will cherish my visit here in memory as long as I live""}, proves particularly powerful. The closing shot, a backward-moving tracking shot following Joe as he retreats from the girl he loves, has a noticeable sense of tragedy about it. Throughout the shot, we are almost waiting for Princess Ann to emerge in the background to proclaim her adoration, but, alas, she never does. After all, life can not always be a fairy-tale, but sometimes one day is enough.  "
155483,tt0058461,ackstasis,australia,7,"Aim for the heart, or you'll never stop me.","Italian director Sergio Leone has an awesome, distinctive visual style. I've sometimes heard his Spaghetti Westerns described as operatic, and such a description is not as inappropriate as it initially sounds. Many Western directors achieve depth and scope in their pictures through the use of landscapes; the vast, dry countryside stretching out in all directions, the sheer majesty of John Ford's Monument Valley. For Leone, the human face is his canvas and his landscape. He periodically intersperses long-shots with intimate portraits of every characters' face: their sweat-soaked skin, their cautiously-levelled eyes, their mouths twisted into a grimace of suspicion. By the mid-1960s, Italy had produced several Westerns ∂? all low-budget, and none particularly successful ∂? until Sergio Leone moved on from the ""sword and sandal"" historical epics on which he had been working, and decided to make his own Spaghetti Western {so-called because of the large level of Italian participation both before and behind the camera, though filming usually took place in Spain to evoke the American Southwest}. 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' was the first film in what would later be called Leone's ""Dollars trilogy"" ∂? the other two entries were 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)' {the one film I haven't yet seen} and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).' All three films famously starred Clint Eastwood as the laconic and morally-ambiguous Man With No Name. What is most fascinating about 'A Fistful of Dollars' is how Leone was able to reconstruct and breathe new life into a distinctly-American genre that had been suffering dwindling popularity in recent years. His approach is almost satirical; every act of violence is tremendously overblown, and, underscored by Ennio Morricone's overwhelming soundtrack, every confrontation is treated with the utmost reverence, as though Leone is consciously mocking the grim sincerity of many of the classic Western filmmakers who preceded him. Every Western director who followed him would owe at least something to the enduring influence of Leone's efforts. In a neglected town in the middle of the stifling desert, two rivals gangs of smugglers are engaged in a bloody tussle for power. Their conflicts have torn apart the lives of the town's innocent civilians∂? except for the coffin-maker, who does a roaring trade. In comes the mysterious Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood), an enigmatic drifter ∂? a master of the ""quick draw"" ∂? who immediately causes a stir among the two gangs, promptly joins both sides, and sets about pitting the two powers against each other in a bid to eradicate their authority once and for all. What separates this character from most other Western anti-heroes is his moral ambiguity; we know practically nothing about his past (aside from the tantalising snippet, ""I knew someone like you once and there was no one there to help"") and his motives are consistently vague. In any case, the film is concerned primarily with spectacle and atmosphere, and the story ∂? allegedly ""borrowed"" from Akira Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo (1961)' ∂? is almost negligible; the result of this strange combination of factors is a film that feels oddly insubstantial, but it's a lot of fun while it lasts.

156884,tt1504320,ackstasis,australia,7,Timing isn't my strong suit,"'The King's Speech (2010)' has been getting a lot of attention this awards season, and not undeservedly; it's a fine drama. This true story is anchored around two characters characters, one a British monarch (Colin Firth), and the other a little-known Australian speech therapist (Geoffrey Rush) with unconventional methods. The chemistry between the two leads is terrific, with Lionel Logue amusingly bouncing his eccentricities off an often-flustered King George VI. (The audience in my theatre responded very well to the lighthearted cultural jabs at Australia's expense). I've usually considered Helena Bonham-Carter to play very cartoonish characters, obviously due to her collaborations with husband Tim Burton, but here she manages to be rather understated and even graceful. Guy Pearce is good in anything (and yet he never appears for long enough), and here he's excellent as King Edward VIII, a haughty womaniser whose proposed marriage to American socialite Wallis Simpsons caused a constitutional crisis. For all its merits, however, 'The King's Speech' feels like too little butter spread over too much bread. The series of therapy sessions between Albert (later George VI) and Lionel are certainly entertaining, and monarch's war-time speech, guided by Lionel as though he were conducting an orchestra, was stirring enough, but I didn't quite feel the momentousness that director Tom Hooper was trying to suggest. One exception takes place in Westminster Abbey when Lionel, lounging casually on the coronation throne, asks his patient, ""Why should I waste my time listening to you?"", to which Albert replies, clearly and firmly: ""Because I have a voice.""

91289,tt0017136,A-Clockwork-Bobbin,united kingdom,9,A landmark of all filming,"What can I say about Metropolis? The words: Amazing, genius, thrilling, captivating, wonderful, purely excellent, and imitable come to mind. Metropolis was a very early sci-fi film, by that master of filming, Fritz Lang. It was made in 1927; so if you had even seen a few seconds of the film, you would be surprised at how advanced it was, even then. No CGI or 'special effects' like we get nowadays; Metropolis is absolutely magical. And it has such a storyline that is absolutely unique... there is not a film like Metropolis. It mixes Sci-Fi, dystopia, romance, and thriller, along with other genres, so there's something for everyone. The most unfortunate thing about Metropolis is that it is incomplete. Or, at least, the versions of the film you can get now is of the incomplete versions. Due to it being a lengthy film (Fritz Lang had a habit of showing every meticulous detail that may be relevant to the storyline), it was cut severely, so that the audience would receive it better. Unfortunately, this made the plot confusing; what seemed like bit-parts were in fact originally key characters, important events were missed out... Generally, the copies of the film you can get now on DVD are of the most 'restored' version, but there are still some parts missed out. Fortunately - the parts of the film which had been cut have just recently be found. I would love to see the film when Metropolis has been reunited with the 'lost' footage! Even so, Metropolis is highly recommendable. There are still some minor flaws, I find, but if you appreciate good films, with good story lines, with revolutionary filming techniques... Then Metropolis is for you.  "

There is simply not a film like M (except, perhaps, for the uncalled-for remake); it is unique in every way: From the storyline, the camera shots, the killer lines, the emotions involved and the audience's response. Also, there is something very odd about the film, which is the fact that this film does not contain any background music at all; creating an eerie feel to the film, and also it somewhat involves the audience into the film. After watching this film for the first time, I couldn't help but admire Fritz Lang's genius behind it. Especially more so, as this was his first sound film. But he even seemed to have mastered the art of sound films, as well!! And Peter Lorre's acting... this film was what made him recognised as an excellent actor. And it is evident; his acting seems natural (which is quite a worrying thought), and there could not have been a better performance from any other actor. If you are more of a fan of modern filming, I must warn: it may seem very drawn out. Unlike modern filming, Fritz Lang's films tend to be very meticulous in the story details, which I personally think is a good point. Also, there is no 'real' on-screen violence; if you were expecting blood and violence, you will probably be disappointed; the art of German Expressionism in films (M is a G.Expressionist film) is that the horrors are subjective, which is what makes this film purely excellent. This film is simply unique. I have never before seen a film like it. Combined with Fritz Lang's genius and Peter Lorre's talents, it has risen to the status of my favourite film. And I'm sure I'm not the only one who favours this film above all others.   "

If you really want my advice, I suggest you read the book first. I have often found that those who watched the movie then read the book got a little bored with it.

Brolin is killed before he ever comes face to face with the villain, and even the car accident which seems like it may bring some cosmic justice fails to do so, the villain just walks away. finally the honorable sheriff cannot do the deed, instead he retires. no wonder many people on here seemed to hate this film, it's challenging and very mean to the audience.

This movie might be about moral dilemmas, but does moral dilemmas really exists? Do we really have a difficult decision to make when we know what's always the right thing to do? This in my point of view is the real thread of the movie, moral choices. What's the right thing to do? To who we owe a good moral act? Can we be part of something that might be immoral and feel good about it? This movie is superb! The final line of the movie almost made me cry alone in my room. Very moving story, with great actors and a superb direction. I would watch this movie again and would definitely share it with a lot of people. The Lives of Others is now one of my top 10 movies of all times.  "
128559,tt0074958,acnovo,mexico,6,Too much,"I think the movie had more impact when it was released than now. In my opinion the movie/story started very well and ended very bad; a good and realistic criticism of how the television ""network"" works, but when the story turns into a ""dark comedy"" satiric it loses all the power it could have and end up as headache of ""Gremlins"" stressful images/dialogs. There is a point in the movie where the entire story comes predictable and the main plot gets lost in the way-too-much satiric situations. The best thing about the movie is Faye Dunaway, she is a great actress and it's a pleasure watching her the entire movie. In my opinion a good movie has to be universal, that anybody from any culture/historic time can understand it, to me, this movie just tried to impact its own specific historic moment. I also felt the story was stretched more than it needed, they could have cut at least 30 minutes of the movie and made it more smooth and powerful. So far this is the only movie I consider it doesn't have to be in the IMDb top 250 list.  "

Human spirit struggling; people moving from one place to other leaving everything they have for a new better life, dealing with moral dilemmas, taking care of older parents, hunger, misery, all these elements are always present in one way or another in those days but what I loved about this movie is the ""hope"", the way this American movie believes in the human spirit and doesn't lead everything to a dramatic tragedy.

153411,tt1431045,acole0228,united states,6,A movie too conventional for an unconventional anti-hero,"Let me just say off the bat that I liked this movie overall. The action and the humor were both very good, and Ryan Reynolds nailed the role of Deadpool. With that said, Deadpool, the infamous anti-hero known for constantly breaking the 4th wall and just overall being unconventional, is stuck in a way too conventional movie that doesn't take enough risks. Deadpool in this film is very much himself, and there's plenty of R-rated humor the usual PG-13 Marvel film tries to avoid, but in the end, the film gets bogged down by a typical 3rd act finale (the weakest point of the film), another forgettable Marvel villain in Ajax (possibly the worst),plus the typical supporting characters like the love interest and goofy sidekick. It's all a little too conventional for such an unconventional character in Deadpool, and the movie suffers.  "
100966,tt0457430,Acolin_f,united states,10,3 Oscars is only half the story.,"Guillermo del Toro's foreign film won 3 Oscars for 2006, for Best Achievement in Art Direction, Best Achievement in Cinematography and Best Achievement in Makeup. That is only half the story. Look at the nominations and you can see why this is an outstanding film and one of the best movies of last year. Pan's Labyrinth was nominated for Best Achievement in Music Written for Motion Pictures/Original Score, Best Foreign Language Film of the Year and Best Writing/Original Screenplay (great story by Guillermo del Toro). Del Toro has indeed created something very special - part war movie, part fantasy, that everyone should see. This is a very 'visual' film that does not rely overly on dialogue. I wish I had seen it in the movie theater. I had none of the why questions. It is much better than the closet tale of Narnia, more compelling and easier easy to watch than Lord of the Rings 2, and yet as political as Schindler's List. Although the young girl's fantasy world juxtaposes her harsh real world, it is not mere escapism. The movie is too shocking for most kids, and some adults. It is not gory, but it is realistically violent. If you liked V for Vendetta and History of Violence, you will like this movie. Like V, the real world dilemma of the plot is simple: good versus shocking evil. Face-to-face fascism in a glance. Submission of good and kind souls. The evil that men do. The young girl and her mother are trapped by circumstances. While the promise of the fantasy world is appropriately extraordinary, the fantasy challenges (tests) Pan's heroine faces are more realistic that the outlandish ones in Lord of the Rings. In Rings, each challenge is supposedly impossible to overcome, yet its group of heroes easily wins and not with special gifts that aid them in overcoming their adversary. Besides, the computer generated graphic images (CGI) fills the screen endlessly with fake backgrounds. In Pan's, the heroine succeeds because of her innate goodness, and yet makes tragic mistakes. Pan's graphics intrude into the stark reality of WWII. In the beginning, CGI offer a glimmer of magic, hope and possibility, which we and the young heroine spy. The tension of the real world drama adds to the movie as the girl moves back and forth between the real world and fantasy land. The tragedy of the real world, and the failings in the fantasy, add suspense, moving the story along and keeping it interesting. In Narnia, there is no interaction between real and fantasy world, the heroes somehow easily conquer and win their fantastic destinies, all in gorgeous and endless CGI packed landscapes. I normally can't watch the audio commentary; it is so full of meaningless crap. Yet the one for this film was as interesting as the one for Young Frankenstein. If you are an avid movie lover, as am I, I found de Toro's references to other movies and techniques fascinating. I've seen a few good movies recently. I also like the wonderful Judi Dench and Cate Blanchette (always good) in Notes on A Scandal, Sharon Stone's incredible and Justin Timberlake's surprisingly good performance in the disturbing Alpha Dog and the fantastic Helen Mirren in The Queen (see the bizarre The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover (1989) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097108/).

109932,tt0434409,Acolin_f,united states,10,"Futuristic British world, where the media panders to neo-Nazi thugss","As I pen this in the balmy days of spring, the tax days of mid-April are still in the rear view mirror, but I am looking forward to baking my body in Florida's relentless summer sunshine. It is ""betwixt and between"" time for movies. It is too soon for the teenage, guilty-pleasure blockbuster of summer and the Academy nominees are drifting to the DVD and rental shelves. Nonetheless, for me, the movie theater still beckons. I knew nothing about the V for Vendetta comic book series before seeing the movie. I was quite surprised by it. This is a futuristic British world, festooned with government cameras, where the media panders to neo-Nazi dressing fascist government of thugs. The hero is a dark, Shakespearean quoting knight, wielding a chest full of Japanese fighting swords and a weirdly disturbing, grinning white mask. He saves the girl and introduces himself with a tongue-twisting soliloquy. The hero, V for Vendetta, challenges the government by threatening to blow-up a government building in the British tradition of Guy Fawkes. He is always one-step ahead of the bad guys, wreaking his murderous revenge for their cruelty and corruption. The movie makes a unwittingly, depiction of the madness and inspiration of terrorists. Blow up the building, V thinks, and the public will see that a government trampling their individual rights is more of a threat than their irrational fears (yeah, right). Although I pump my movies through my almost fantastic classic Klipsch Khorn loudspeakers system, I still appreciate movie theaters with speakers lining the walls and stadium seating. These venues are particularly good for action films, my favorite genre being the sci-fi action movie. In this case, it was a delight to wander into the big box and see a late spring entry. If you like the same genre, I think you will like V for Vendetta. The domino scene (where V tips over black and red dominoes to form a giant letter V) involved 22,000 dominoes, was assembled by four professional domino assemblers, and took 200 hours to set up. In the scene where V has Creedy cornered in the greenhouse, V plays Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. In Morse Code, the opening notes of this piece are ""... _"", or V. This is also the reason for the piece's enormous popularity in England during World War Two. (The Allied slogan was ""V for Victory"".) The Symphony's opening was used as a call-sign in the European broadcasts of the BBC during World War II in reference to Winston Churchill's ""V for Victory"". The name Evey is pronounced EV, with E being the fifth letter of the alphabet, V being five in Latin and Y being the 25th letter (5 squared) On a clock that has an hour hand and a minute hand, the time 11:05 makes a V. These two numbers, 11 and 5, where 11 is November, and 5 is the day of November, spell out: the fifth of November. ""Remember, remember the 5th of November."" The voice-overs about the futility of non-violence and the definition of humanism that can be heard during the end credits are sound bites from speeches given by Malcolm X and Gloria Steinem, respectively. In the memorial for those that died as a result of the virus, the statues are of children playing ""Ring around the Rosie"". There is a frequently cited (though untrue) urban legend that this nursery rhyme was about the bubonic plague. SPOILER: When Evey is being captured by a member of the commando outside Dietrich's house, if we look closer, we can see that the commando member has burnt flesh (it is visible trough the commando mask's hole for the eyes), so it is obvious that he is V. But it is visible only for a second.  "

And they are up against a gigantic space station that is blowing planets up. They hold a meeting in front of hologram table and they blow the station up by using x-wings and by disabling shields on the ground. Everything the same as in ' A New Hope'. Disney played it safe and I can understand why. Disney want's at least a billion world- wide. So they didn't take any chances, they used familiar stuff they knew it will work. I guess it's not easy to please everyone, especially SW fans and their expectations. When you're making a movie that has a lot of fans even before the movie is made...I guess you don't get too creative and you don't take to many risks. I enjoyed the movie, it's nice, solid, and it's star wars. But ''this feels familiar''-filling was too strong. It's almost as if around the middle of the movie you knew exactly what to expect and you just wait for the movie to roll out. It's OK to throw in stuff from original SWs. For fans, nostalgia and to get that familiar SW filling. Old characters (Luke,Leia,Han etc,), Luke's saber, Vader's helmet, recognizable ship designs..it all works well and ties you to the originals. But you don't have to do the exact same story and all the same beats of the original movie. It's a remake/reboot as much as it is a sequel.  "

I don't want to repeat things that have already been said. I'll just say what annoys me. Most tension in this movie comes from it's characters being unable to speak. What's up with that? 1.So we got this guy, who obviously has something to do with the kidnapping of the two girls, and as it turns out, he was the one who lured them into the van. It was a sloppy kidnapping, they immediately caught the suspect, but guess what,he can't (?)speak. They said that he is on a level of a ten year old, but he behaves as he is on a level of a three year old, but still, he has a driver license(?). So we then come to all the beating,torturing and all the screaming :'Tell me where are they?' If he said: it took them to my mothers house, the movie is over. So he was so resilient to torture or simply he was to stupid to make a sentence that makes sense. The later makes more sense, but on the other hand, it makes no sense at all. 2.Then comes the priest who has a rotten corp in his basement. But he just mumbles. Like he's a 3 year old as well. He isn't able to say any useful information. Who's the dead guy, what's his name , how he came to him (or with whom, with what vehicle etc, etc..) He just can't speak intelligible. 3. Them comes the guy who steals kid's clothing, using pig's blood, hiding it with snakes. He's intelligent enough to recognize a cop, to escape him, to, at the first moment, when the cop shows at his home, fool him by saying '' I've never seen you before''. But when they need to interrogate him, he is suddenly like a 3 year old, drawing and mumbling and drooling like a completely retarded person who's unable to say one sentence that makes sense. So we still don't know anything and the movie goes on. 4.Then comes the girl that escaped, she's in the hospital, but of course, she is not able to speak. Or else she would tell us where she was held, and the movie's over. 5.And finally , when they rescue the second girl, she doesn't seem to speak as well. Or else she would tell them about hidden basement in the yard with entrance hidden under the old car. But no... So somewhere around 80 min into the movie , I had enough. I know that they wanted that exciting, disturbing thriller, exploring moral bipolarity of every human, dark (metaphorically and literally with all the rain and pale colors).

42121,tt0120586,Acorn-2,united states,9,"A provocative, intelligent, well-made film"," It is always easy to poke holes in the the efforts of others. The more sincere and earnest those efforts are, the easier cynical critics find it to denigrate them. Nothing succeeds entirely and AHX certainly has a number of (minor) weaknesses that others have pointed out - primarily problems with the script. But where it fails it mostly fails because it tries to do something very difficult. There is a sincere attempt here to add a thoughtful and provocative comment to the important dialogue on bigotry and hate that is essential to human survival in an increasingly inter-racial, intercultural world. That Kaye and McKenna choose to end with a truism: ""hate is baggage"" - is not a cop-out, but a painful truth - hate is in us and only by dealing with our own hate can we deal with that around us. What is perceived as Norton's ""vanity"" is completely in keeping with the character - stemming from the same insecurity as his need to control and his racist self-aggrandisement. What else is the swastika tattoo, for instance, but a piece of vanity: primitive body-jewelry? His performance is daring, frightening and compelling if one is able to drop the defenses of cynicism and be moved by it. Ditto Edward Furlong's work. This is one of the best realised films by a first-time director and first-time screenwriter I can ever remember. Although imperfect, it is damn good. Even to have gotten such a difficult, non-""feel-good"" film to the screen is an enormous labor. All involved deserve thanks and praise for - not a flawless job - but a job very well done.   "

4865,tt0068646,acorral-1,mexico,9,Familia taking care of business,"One of the best thing about this film is the terrific performance of Brando asDon Vito Corleone. He created a character capable for transmitting themost ambiguous emotions. For one side, we have the loving father (and godfather of course), husband, grand father, friend. In the other hand he is one of the coldest blooded characters in movie history. ""It's not personal, it's strictly business"" is the perfect phrase to define the way of the ""Familia"" taking care of business related activities. There are several sequences that have become classic scenes: at the beginning of the movie we see a merciful Vito sitting in his ""throne"" deciding the destiny of dishonored fathers, Hollywood actors, rude bodyguards. ""Remember that some day I will ask another favor in return"". Don Vito is respected as a priest, his hand is kissed and he takes care of the situations one way of another. Religion is, ironically, one of the main characters of the history. Four major scenes are related with catholic rites: Two weddings, a funeral and a baptize. Italian costumes are essential as well. The family concept, the traditions; big dinners with pasta, meat balls and red wine. Concepts as honor, loyalty, vengeance are reminded consistently along the three hours. In another classic scene we visualize the ""familia"" way to solve some pending issues: Johnny, the favorite Vito's godsons is one of the hottest Hollywood stars hoping to obtain the leading role in a movie. The producer does not want him on the film for personal reasons, but at the end he accepts once he discovers his favorite horse head the next morning in his bed. Robert Duvall is the adviser, Vito's right hand and in my opinion the second best performance. He is responsible of dealing with the other families. He hates violence but justify every decision to use it. He is the conscience and a critical member, no matter if he is not Sicilian. Other sequence (I think the best) is where the big families have a meeting to solve their differences. Don Vito did not want to be involved in the drug business, he wanted to remain with the usual ones: gambling, liquor and unions. His relation ships with influent people are important to the mob environment. He agrees to permit the drug dealing and offers protection just with one condition: at this time his son Sonny (performed by James Caan) was brutally killed. He accepts his dead as a part of the business and he is willing to make a truce to stop the blood spill. In one of the best scenes ever performed by Brando he stands up and says (not literally): ""I won't revenge my son's death. Mike, my other son is hiding somewhere in Italy and he will return shortly. I accept the conditions to bring peace, but if my son is murdered in any way, shoot accidentally by a cop, have a car accident or appears hanging in his cell I will blame someone in this room"" an then he signed his agreement with a huge with his enemy. A good movie with excellent cast selection, including a good performance of young Al Pacino and his incidental transformation from war hero to new family Don. Coppola created a myth with his trilogy. The second part was actually better than the first one and this is much to say. The baptize sequence at the end is just extraordinary. The initiation of the new Don receiving the holy water and holy blood. A new life, a new grandson, a new era. The end is just the beginning. The familia is not dead is just taking care of business as usual. "
89386,tt0042876,acorral-1,mexico,10,The first master piece of Kurosawa,"Rash«Ômon (1950) By the time that Kurosawa was shooting Rashomon, other genius film makers were involved in crucial projects: Luis Bu«Òuel was filming ""Los Olvidados"" (1950), Ingmar Bergman was writing the screenplay for ""Summer Interlude"" (1951) and filming two full length movies (""To Joy"" and ""High tension"", both in 1950) and Federico Fellini was shooting his first film ""Variety Lights"" (1950). Probably was only a fortunate coincidence that four of the best filmmakers ever were involved in very personal and decisive project in the early stages of their careers. It's important to mention that by those days the Italian Neo-realism was clearly the most dominating and extended film movement. In the international film festivals a lot of pictures in that style were awarded and directors like Visconti, Rosellini and De Sica were considered the top of the list. But in 1950 something happened and changed the film industry forever. Bergman was acclaimed by his early works and the 1950 projects and the decisive film ""Summer interlude"" (with the Sweden star Maj-Britt Nilsson) meant for him enough budget to start shooting other more personal movies. His first major film was filmed three years later (Summer with Monika (1953) with his first collaboration with Harriett Andersson) and since then, Bergman had one of the most admirable film productions. Bu«Òuel, on the other hand, was filming his first personal project since ""the golden age"" (1930). The film received an award of Cannes festival for best direction. (For further information about this film refer to my comment in ""Los Olvidados""). Fellini by his side had a well received debut with his first film and a young actress was awarded with an acting price (Gulietta Massina, Fellini's wife). The three of them had very solid and world acclaimed film careers. But I would like to talk in more detail about Kurosawa's first major film: Rashomon. In 1947, Kurosawa met Toshiro Mifune (the most important actor for Kurosawa, along with Takashi Shimura). In his book ""Something like an autobiography"", the Japanese director mentioned the impact that was to met Mifune. He described the young actor as a strong presence, with hard character and natural acting skills. Actually Mifune and Shimura had a collaboration with Kurosawa in the 1947 film ""Ginrei no hate"". By 1950, Kurosawa invited those two actors again and left the main male character to Mifune. The result is brilliant. A murder story involving three persons (one woman, two men). The film started at Rashomon (a ruined temple) during a rainy afternoon. Two persons were sheltered there and a third one arrives. Then, one of them (The woodcutter, played by Shimura) started to tell a very confusing story. He was walking into the woods and found some personal objects and a body. Then we can see the trial (where only the witnesses are visible) and the woodcutter version was heard. During the movie, the director change from the scene in the rainy temple to the trial several times. Then we can hear the version of Tajomaru (Mifune), a well known thief and he described his version as a love and honor tale. He was touched by the woman and cheats the other man in order to possess her. At the end, the killing took place after a samurai style combat between the two men. Then we witness the woman and the death character's (through some magic conjure) versions. Every story is totally different from the other. In one, Tajomaru is a brave and fair warrior, in other is a villain with no feelings, in other is a coward. Beautiful sequences where we can see the same action viewed and told by four different characters. At the end the woodcutter told the real version (totally opposite from the others) to the stranger and at that stage of the movie is very difficult to know which version is the truth or at least the closest. The decision is on us. The final sequence with the baby is magnificent and the acting performances (especially from Mifune) are superb. All the characters took the human emotions and feelings in a very emotive way, the existential questions are present all the time and this simple history is told beautifully by this great Japanese director. The film received the golden lion award in the 1951 Venice film festival along with the Italian film critics award. One urban legend said that the category for best foreign movie was created after the honorary Oscar given to the film in 1952. This is, with no doubts the first Kurosawa's master piece. After this, several major films were produced during the 50's through the 90's under Kurosawa's direction. A must see movie and reference.  "
133318,tt0060827,acorral-1,mexico,10,"Beautiful movie, shocking experience, a master piece","Is hard to say if this film is Bergman's best, but I can say with no doubt that this movie is one of the best ever. Reasons are many and I would like to start with the excellent photograph (as always) of Sven Nykvist. He is a genius and I can understand why Nykvist had been working with Bergman in 22 films and TV productions: when two geniuses collide the result is superb. He had been the cinematographer of Bergman's finest movies such as the excellent ""Cries and Whispers"", ""Fanny and Alexander"", ""Autumn Sonata"", ""The hour of the wolf"", ""Face to face"" and many more. In a sequence of Persona, almost at the end we can see the two of them (Bergman and Nykvist) behind the camera, preparing a scene with Liv Ullman. A silent recognition from the director to his friend. They been working together since 1953. How important is Nykvist in Bergman's work? Well I couldn't find better answer that Persona film. The use of light and shadows is one of the key elements on the plot. In the climax scene, when Alma (Bibi Anderson) is talking with Elisabeth (Liv Ullman) about her son's dark history, we basically see the same conversation twice; one focus the camera on Ullman and the other one, on Anderson. In the first sequence half of the face is on the shadows, when we see the other sequence, Andersonn's face have the same peculiarity, except for the side, is the opposite. At the end of the two sequences, Bergman overlap the two lighted sides of the faces to create one single face. An extraordinary and beautiful result, visually speaking. Other important element is the two actresses. For Liv Ullman, this film represented her first collaboration with Bergman as an actress and because of this film they started a romance. As a result they had a daughter and other 10 films together (including Autumn Sonata, Face to face, Cries and whispers). One characteristic of Mr. Bergman is to work with a select group of actors in all his movies. In this occasion he worked, besides Ullman, with Bibi Anderson and Gunnar Bj«Ùrnstrand (The seventh seal). Anderson's performance is excellent as the hysterical nurse. One of the best sequences is when she is telling Elisabeth the orgy history by the beach. The dialog is so powerful that we can image with clarity all the actions described. Good performances, as all Bergman's releases. Another key element of this movie is the strong criticism against Vietnam War (and war in general). Is a silent protest and in one shot we saw Elisabeth in front of the TV when a monk is burning alive. Probably that's why Ullman'a character stop speaking. The position and ideology is another important element in the movies, and that's why I consider Bergman one of the greatest, because he has the ability to reflect with mastery social problems and adopt his ideological tendencies and believes. Only few directors as Godard, Bu«Òuel, Herzog or Fassbinder have the same ability. If you want to read more about the film, I recommend the essay that Roger Ebert included in his book "" 100 great movies"". He explained in a very simple words some of the sequences (like the first arbitrary images at the beginning, middle and end of the movie). Finally I want to comment about the image that represent the presentation card for the entire movie: Ullman and Anderson's faces. The first at the back, grabbing Anderson's hair, both smiling. Probably this is one of the milestones of 20th century filming industry. A must see movie and a master work. If you like movies, you will like Persona.  "

Contemporaries such as John McClane and Jack Bauer have made relevant (and to be sure, important) strides in the field. But only Jason Bourne has mastered the rump-rupturing arts. To him, a book is not merely entertainment for a leisurely afternoon at the beach. Nor is a towel simply a convenient drying device. In the supremely talented hands of Jason Bourne these innocuous objects become weapons of ass destruction. It's truly a remarkable sight to behold, and one I encourage you all to witness.  "
117284,tt2488496,acosta-15,brazil,4,"After so many lessons throughout so many years, how could they do it wrong?","After watching TFA 3 times and letting it settle down (a bit) on me, I feel ready to share my opinion. I know there are hundreds (and soon thousands) of funny liners making jokes with the ""force"" here so I'll spare it and go straight to the point. They missed a HUGE opportunity to make things right again after the prequels. By ""they"" I mean Disney, JJ, Lucas, even Kasdan, Williams, Ford - the entire Hollywood. I'll give it a 4 star because it bears the name Star Wars and has some (few) moments to it that mechanically and automatically trigger my infancy memories and feelings, and I'm a helpless fan ruined by the original trilogy myself. How could they get it so wrong is my wonder. What is so hard to get about SW to make it so wrong after all??? There are so many holes that I could go on and on, many have nailed it here already quite good so I'll just say it to the records what really bothered me most in this ""sequel"": To me, the way BB-8 ends up being in his position vs. the way C3PO and R2 end up in the hands of Luke is representative of the main difference between the two. It is a million times less elegant and clever, and this can be said of most other situations too. BB-8 is cute and likable, but R2 is cute, likable and has a personality of his own and doesn't act like a puppy or The Cat in Boots. If they have gotten that one idea right maybe TFA could be slightly better. The original trilogy - ANH in particular, being the first episode - took its time to develop the situations and characters at the same time the action is developing, and everyone and everything was in the context, and we are taken by the hand to the journey as it unfolds. And that is the most important in any film. It's something very few flicks can pull right, an JJ failed here more than he did with Star Trek IMO. We're not taken to much in TFA, and I feel really really sad to say that. The magic of the original trilogy is that it makes us feel part of the adventure. JJ treats us like spectators, and the scenes don't disappoint in that sense. He's a good scene maker. It's easy to ""like"" BB-8, or cheer for the rogue Stormtrooper, or pity for the Victoria's Secret model starving scavenger with fancy brit accent. But not in the deep ways we cheered for Luke, Han and Leia, and even the villains are dubious, shallow, vague because they have no real sense of purpose, no big aspirations. Even the horrible bad guys from the stupid prequel have more depth, and that is unfortunate to say. I'm really sad to say that but it's true, I wish it wasn't. The 80's won't come back, I know. But it was special. Take Ren for instance: if Darth Vader himself turned ""good"" again, what in the galaxy could lead his grandson - being the son of major Resistance characters - to become a bad guy and believe he can ""finish what he has started""? Vader hasn't started anything in the first place, or killing Luke is still the major objective of the villains after so many years??? Pathetic. And he's a wimp too, making him weak both with the Force and mentally and psychologically didn't add anything to the character, sorry. I won't even mention the master villain, what the hell was that??? Also, where did the first of Luke's lightsaber come from, if he lost it in a bottomless pit of Cloud City in Empire Strikes Back when Vader chopped his hand off (and he built himself a new one for RoJ)??? Or am I missing something here?? They had to put on a Grafflex one in there too didn't they, oh my... As I said I could go on, there are way too many flaws. And no, Ford does't look like he's having fun. He's old and grumpy and tired and that's how he plays Solo. And Leia... Why would a Rebellion general use so much Botox and care about high heels??? She's a sad shadow of Leia of the past, both physically (that'd be OK time passes for us all) and mentally (that's not OK we get wiser and sager with time). She looks like she can't lead his grandson and some friends on a trip to Disneyland, much less a rebel army against anyone. She wasn't even able to educate her son for god-sakes. The ""new old guys"" almost ruined the ""old old guys"", that frightens me because we're about to get more of them in the next films and could potentially kill SW. That brings me to Luke, I thought he was a wimp too by leaving it all but once again he saved the story: in those short 2 scenes he's in irradiates with charisma and shows he still has the force, even when we only see his mech hand on R2. That alone totally blows it, they should have gone that way that is so powerful, so powerful. He is the saving mystery of TFA to me. When I saw him at the end of the movie, I knew exactly why he got away from all that pathetic friends and stupid galaxy that Disney built around him. I'd do the same if I could run away from the overwhelming hype and oppressing marketing of Disney's Star Wars. Maybe I'll take a DVD and TV set with my 3 copies of pre-editing trilogy to that island too. Hopes dies last so I'll wait for the next episodes on this. Fortunately no one can undo the original trilogy, it is what it is.  "
117742,tt2488496,acosta-15,brazil,4,Epic fail!,"I've already reviewed TFA here but after watching it one more time I decided to once again express my indignation with what has been done to the Star Wars saga. If the scrip had been given to a group of fans or consulted with one maybe these grotesque mistakes would have been avoided, and maybe TFA would have merited the Star Wars name!!! I bet many of them are more capable than whoever did this piece of lazy crap. But no such luck, and what we have here is a BIG FAIL. HUGE! There's almost no character development, no soul, no nothing. They're thrown into scene without reason or almost no background, to do nothing but react to circumstances. The dialogs are shallow, the humour is ill-timed and stupid, everything feels lazy, unconvincing, because it's all anchored (what???) in a big flawed thin air script. Everything is permeated by explosions, boring battles and nonsense action to distract viewers from the poor, senseless and incredibly hollow plot. I'm being generous calling THAT a plot. The bad guy is half-bad and he's the offspring of two major Rebellion characters, which is an absurd no matter what reason they might come up with to explain his turn to the Dark Side. Either way he's just a teen Darth Vader wannabe, a fan of a redeemed villain (!!!!) which is absolute nonsense if you think about it even superficially. If he was honestly inspired by Vader then he should be a Jedi not a weak pseudo-Sith! That 's an amateurish, unforgivable mistake for any SW fan or not. The other villains are hysterical, immature, obtuse, and absolutely without sense of purpose. There's no discernible chain of command, it all looks like the last desperate days of the Third Reich but it's totally messy and unconvincing. The big guy is - mind you - really big, and looks like he came from The Lord Of The Rings. And that's because he actually did, no kidding!!! Besides, it oozes bad CGI too, a far far cry from the mysterious and powerful yet realistic Palpatine. This Snoke is indeed a joke the size of his lame CGI effect. Hyperspace jumps are used and abused here, and finally there's a Red Matter clone on steroids which is also abused in a very un-dramatic and meaningless way. It's red, bright and can be seen by naked eyes from apparently the whole galaxy, for an even greater effect but the result is null. At least the rogue stormtrooper got very excited about it, but then he's quite an exaggerated fella that gets excited about everything way too easy. And the light saber fights... oh my, one of Star Wars staples... in TFA they aren't duels or confrontations. Far, far from it! They're casual, without any sense of purpose. Thus they lack drama, power and energy. It all look more like badly choreographed teen sword bashing. And they're very few and short, because unfortunately there's no need for those in this story - so much so that Ren uses his stupid lightsaber with stupid crossguards to destroy First Order property in childish anger fits - twice!!! I mean... Really??? The music - oh the music - doesn't leave an impress, at all! It has snippets of Star Wars here and there but was used generously on the trailers, to cause nostalgia as effect, tease our imagination and draw us to theaters. It worked, but in the movie it doesn't. It's not remarkable, it comes and goes undecided and off the movie pace, it's not original and not ""old Star Wars epic"" either. Truly lame. There are a fez scenes that really captured the spirit and soul of SW though. The views of the remainings of the battles of old scattered throughout the desert are authentically dramatic and solid, and as such they fell powerful and real. Unfortunately it wasn't explored as it should, so it becomes just one more scene really, a good underdeveloped idea. Also the idea of Luke being gone is a powerful theme as well, I hope they know how to explore it in the next movies. I dunno what make of it, time will make justice and hopefully next director puts this back on track because JJ had his shot and ruined it. I feel bad talking about something Star Wars like that but I wish it was different. I have a feeling that they filmed it right and screwed upon editing it, because the trailers were going so well and captured the feeling of the originals. I'm not counting on it though!!!  "

34043,tt0317248,acrighto-24997,united states,10,A masterpiece for the ages,"Set in the slums of 1960s and 70s Rio De Janeiro, this masterpiece somehow manages to be both a romantic coming-of-age tale, a brutal drama, and an action-packed gangster movie all in one. The cinematography is a visual feast and the palates used for the different eras of the film help define the climate and mood of the neighborhood at that particular time. Very well done. The visual style of the film is both exciting and innovative. Not the controlled camera movements of a slick American mafia flick but instead seems to be inspired by the rhythm of neighborhood in which the film takes place- very frenetic, raw, and loose camera-work that feels like a documentary at times while seamlessly sneaking in extremely stylish homages to gangster films of the past. The cast- which seems to be full of mostly non-actors and unknowns outside of Brazil- seems to be expertly chosen. There isn't a single second of the film that isn't believable. If you haven't seen this film yet it should be at the top of your list. Easily one of the greatest films of all time.  "

Charlie Kaufman penned this one as well as ""Being John Malkovich"" so he is very much into getting into our heads. If you could wipe the memories of a love affair gone sour, would you? Time has a way of helping us with painful memories, so that eventually only the good memories remain, should we accelerate the process? Relationships, the fabric of humanity, is what we are all about, finding them, enjoying them, hating them, leaving them. Every couple in divorce court filled with disappointment and anger once sat looking into each others eyes, feeling madly in love. The film is a little choppy at times, but you can navigate the course. The point is that every couple has strengths, weaknesses and it can be easy to forget the good bits in a bad moment. So what would be the consequences if your partner had the memories of you erased after your relationship hit a bump in the road? It's a thoughtful story, and will add a bit to your intellectual repertoire if you have ventured away from your romantic poets.  "
103847,tt0050976,acrjamz,portugal,10,allegoric masterpiece,"A masterful and timeless pondering on mortality and faith produced in the late 50's, Det sjunde inseglet (The Seventh Seal) is undoubtedly one of the most introspective films, with deeply self analyzing characters all coming to terms with the sudden realization of their own death. Block, a knight returned from the crusades, is faced with the imminent threat of death and struggles to find answers to his questions, all deeply connected with faith. His curiosity leads to a game of chess with Death itself. With stunning contrasting visual the allegory comes to life in a very theatrical manner with death itself personified. The eternal and frustrating try of self understanding is at the core of the film communicated by deeply dramatic dialog, aided by stunning medieval iconography and symbolism such as the famous danse macabre. There's also a heavy contrast between characters like Block and Jof. Jof represents the simple minded, uncomplicated, serene, with a certain ease in living and loving. While the other characters are absolutely consumed with the though of death, Jof and Mia remain care free for the most part. This dichotomy presented in so many other characters gives the film a theatrical and allegoric feeling but still accessible meaning. The imagery is remarkable with some of the most recognizable shots in film history, from the beginning to the ending frames. Heavy contrasts both in character, philosophy and cinematography make the film an unquestionable 10.  "

The film take place in East Germany, in the middle of eighties. The main topic is hidden struggle with the communist regime. Somebody can say that this movie it's too long and it's make it boring. But I think that Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck, director of this film, made everything correct. Love, hope, struggle, suffering, compassion - everything are in ""The life of others"". We can see how people try to change situation in country and which price they need sometimes to pay for this. And the most powerful moment of this movie it's, of course, unexpected ending. Freedom cannot be stopped but nobody says that you can do it without victim. So when you are tired from pointless thrillers and unfunny comedies and when you want see really emotional drama - try ""The life of Others"".  "

I can handle profanity, but it's just one after another. And then theirs that weird scene in the pawn shop. Really? Who wants to see that in a movie? It is a shame the actors couldn't do better with the script they got. The plot (what little plot there is) is about John Travolta and Samuel L Jackson trying to deliver a case to Marsellus (Ving Rhames). Theirs a bunch of useless side-stories and dialog that no one cares about. The only upside is the ensemble cast, which is really diverse.

The plot is about a bunch of thieves with code names who are trying to rob a bank, and one of the crew happens to be a cop. In usual Tarantino fashion, he dices the film up into different parts - first is the end, and so on. He cuts it up so you don't actually see the robbery. Really annoying. The script is constant swearing. Really nothing more. The cast leaves some to be desired. Michael Madsen makes me want to hit myself in the face constantly. The ear cutting scene was a letdown. Tarantino can't act, he should of stayed behind the camera. Pulp fiction had a slightly better cast (Willis, Jackson, Travolta), but an equally horrible script. This movie looks like it was made on virtually no money. There are only 3 major sets, and a few other places on the movie. A giant warehouse were a good chunk of the movie is spent, along with the diner, and a car. In the end, I was not impressed.

120927,tt0477348,act_of_bob,united kingdom,9,No Room for Platitudes,"This film really gripped me, but not in any spectacular way, more for the un/ethical values that often creep through the film at quite inopportune times. Despite the violence -although credibly a restrained use of foul-language- the film cannot really be said to be brutal, and instead examines the sinful natures of two men, who both mete out the seven equally, and never really balance the moral with the ethical value of life over the pursuit of death; instead they pursue their own agendas without regard to society or the law. By the close of the film it could equally be argued the law is culpable in sharing the pie of sin. Another intriguing element is that none of the main protagonists actually meet face-to-face, despite the cat and mouse battle between Bardem and Brolin. This may reflect the changing state of crime in the US, at least on film. In classic cowboy film the two protagonists would ultimately end face to face, or be overwhelmed by the forces of good and admonished from our conscience. But in NCFOM the law in the shape of Tommy Lee Jones is reduced to an ineffective theologian mulling over the changing nature of society in the face of law, and as such most of the revealing discourse comes through Jones. There are subtle elements to the film that carry the tale beyond the end, and often cause you to view the film to reason the logic for such simple elements such as when both characters desperately seek to purchase a shirt to evade a critical moment. All of which proves Joel and Ethan Cohen are becoming incredible talents in Hollywood, and their determination to do something new with script often translates into intriguing and dramatic film.  "

The movie is about Oskar Schindler who came to Poland as a business man, and ended up saving 1100 Jews from extermination. The fact that the movie is filmed in black and white is quite a masterstroke from Steven Spielberg. This means that the movie looks like an old documentary, instead of a feature-film from Hollywood. The movie is packed with emotions and shows who war brings out the cruelty in all people. Being able to understand the German language, I was delighted to see that small-talk between the soldiers were in genuine German and not English.

There are spectacular battle- and fightscenes in gladiator, great characters(both hero and villian), a blockbuster-soundtrack and also a great story. I can`t recommend you enough to see this movie. This has to be one of the best films in 2000. 10/10       "
58961,tt0110357,action-6,norway,10,Pure magic!," The Lion King is Disney`s finest moment. The story is excellent, the music is top-class and the voice-overs are perfect. Simba is the cub of the King Of ""Pride Rock"", Mufasa, and nephew of the evil Scar. Scar wants to get rid of Simba and Mufasa, because he wants to be king himself. Scar kills Mufasa and he gets the hyenas to chase Simba. Simba escapes the hyenas and he is now alone. He teams up with outsiders Timon and Pumba, and the movie tells about these characters and how they live together. It is a classic tale of the battle between good and evil, it is backed up by fast-paced actionmusic composed by Hans Zimmer(The Rock, Crimson Tide, The Peacemaker), the other music is splendid too. The arguably best thing about ""The Lion King"" is the way it looks. The animation is flawless, the attention-to-detail is awesome and it moves extremely smooth. 10/10   "

One night he is attacked in his own home by one of his old clients, who is now a grown-up. Willis`s character is named Malcolm Crowe, and he is determined to never fail again. One day he is going to see a new client: a boy named Cole Sear, who is having some kind of unknown trouble. This movie is a horrorthriller, there aren`t that many shocks in it, but it is a well directed and exciting film.

21117,tt0120737,Actiongirl,united states,10,See this film...NOW!!!," I've been a Peter Jackson fan for some time now...from the moment I saw ""Bad Taste"", I was hooked. Then came ""Dead Alive"", ""Meet the Feebles"", ""The Frighteners"", and so on. So basically I've been slavering to see ""TLOTR"" ever since word of its production. I was not let down. See this film...NOW!!! It is amazing, entrancing, and any other positive ""-ing""s one can dream up. Sure, Tolkien fans may be a bit upset over the reworking, but if there were none, we'd have a 5-hour movie instead of a 2 1/2-hour movie, wouldn't we? I gladly traded some overlapping stories and reworking for the opportunity to see some of the most fantastic cinematography, CGI and prosthetic work (let us not forget Jackson's background in ""traditional"" SFX), acting, and attention to detail onscreen in some time. The fight/battle scenes in particular were most memorable. Jarring and disorientating as the camera work may be, it makes one feel...jarred and disoriented. As I know *I* would feel during a fight or battle. I could feel myself tense up during these scenes; in my book, Jackson did his job. The casting was dead on, except for Sean Bean as Boromir and Liv Tyler as Arwen. I felt Bean's talent was wasted on such a transparent character, and quite frankly I could have done without Tyler's sneeze-and-you-miss-her Arwen. There were enough delightful performances to carry me through the movie, especially Orlando Bloom as Legolas. Although technically a secondary character, Bloom's Legolas stands out with some *phenomenal* archery and fighting skills. And Ian McKellen as Gandalf...well, I really couldn't see anyone else in the role. He *is* Gandalf. (And of course Jackson pulls his usual ""Hitchcock"" in this film...=) ) When I saw ""TLOTR"", there were quite a few parents who had brought their young (I'm talking around 6- to 8-years-old) kids. Mom, Dad...unless you want squirming offspring after the film hits the 2-hour mark, or toddlers with interesting nightmares for the next few days, don't take your young kids to see this. The Dark Riders ALONE are enough to freak out even the stoutest little heart... All in all, I give Peter Jackson kudos on what has obviously been a (triple) labor of love. It shows. I'm eagerly awaiting the next two!   "
7042,tt0468569,actionmovieheroboy,canada,8,Excellent movie,"This Batman was by far the best Batman to come out. The directing was really good, probably the best I have ever seen. Now although it was a very excellent movie, it was not the greatest movie I have ever seen. There happened to be a few cheesy lines I thought could've been left out, as well as a couple scenes that didn't progress the story or introduce action or anything of entertaining value. The movie started a little slow, until the first scene is about to end, but it's like that in all movies. The unfortunate thing about this movie is the character that started and ended within the movie, it leaves out a good villain if they were to do another movie. He should've became the character at the end of the movie, rather then being part of it. "
22410,tt0120737,actionmoviestar,united states,1,Living proof that you should not always believe the hype,"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring the December 2001 blockbuster directed by now famed Peter Jackson may have been a hit critically and commercially but this film is very very very far from what I call a good film. For three years, I ad voided seeing this movie. Mostly everybody I knew or encountered had nothing but positive things to say about this film. So in January 2005, I finally decided to give this movie a chance. My assumptions were right; I ended up not liking the movie. There are many problems with this movie. For one, the acting. The acting was pretty terrible in this film. Most of the actors and actresses in this film looked like they just rehearsed their lines one time in the mirror before they began shooting this monster(and I don't mean in a good way) of a film. Lord of the Rings did not really have any characters I felt sorry for nor cared about. Can somebody please explain to me why the heck Sir Ian McKellan got an Oscar nomination for this schlok of a film? How he got nominated still puzzles me to this day. Now I know I will be crucified for saying this but I don't care. The plot, when I think about it, wasn't all that great. Basically from what I gather about this plot is that it is about a young hobbit that embarks on an epic quest to destroy a ring. Wow, how interesting is that(sarcastic)! I think another reason why I didn't like this movie is because it's a fantasy film and I hate fantasy movies. So it was quite obvious that I wasn't going to like ""LOTR"" Now, I haven't seen the last two films but I still want to see them, so I can complete the trilogy. Who knows, I might actually like them. All in all, ""LOTR:TFOTR"" gets two thumbs down, way down.  "

But how he learns it is what makes the film what it is. The ending is spectacular and provokes even more thought. This should be required viewing for all Americans-shown at an early age, completely uncut, in order to beat its awesome message into all of our ignorant, developing heads.   "
119205,tt2488496,actionstudiosco,united states,10,There has been an awakening,"Let's face it. There was no way JJ could have made a new Star Wars film that people wouldn't over hype and end up being disappointed about because it wasn't exactly how they imagined it. No matter what, fans would have been angry. But let me tell you that some of the reviews I have read on IMDb are incredibly unfair, untrue, and just downright disrespectful to an incredible movie. This wasn't just a great Star Wars film. It was a great film, and will hopefully be seen as an ideal for other films to follow. Dare I say it, this movie was almost perfect. On par with movies like Citizen Kane and Shashank for sure. Not as good as Empire or A New Hope, but significantly better than Return and embarrassingly better than the prequels. Here's why: 1. The new characters were written beautifully. Rey is the best protagonist in film history. (I have a million reasons why if anyone wants to debate). Kylo Ren must be one of the best villains in movie history. It's hard to compete with Heath's Joker and Emperor Palpatine, but I do think he is a better villain than Darth Vader. (Again, don't kill me, I'm happy to back this up). Finn, Po, and BB8 also exceeded my expectations. Ma Kanata was fine, I didn't have any problems with her. The silver stormtrooper lady was the only character I didn't really like, just because she didn't seem that important to me. Maybe she'll come into play more in the future installments though. The best part about the characters in this film is that they can't be summed up in a handful of words. Their personalities are complex, they feel like real, actual, living, breathing people who are out there somewhere in a galaxy far far away. 2. JJ did a fantastic job incorporating old characters. None of them seemed squeezed in, they were all actually important to the story (other than C3P0, but when has he ever been important?). It's hard to get my point across without spoiling, so I'll leave it at that. 3. The acting was freaking amazing. I've actually seen some reviews saying the acting was bad, even worse than the prequels. I'm sorry, but if you honestly think that, you need to watch the sand speech again. Even comparing the acting in TFA to the sand speech is unspeakable. TFA's acting was phenomenal. The returning actors reprised their roles with passion and zest, breathing new life into characters I never thought I'd get to see again. Han Solo, Chewbacca, Leia, they're back! Meanwhile, the new actors were insanely good. I couldn't have been more impressed, particularly with Rey, Finn, Kylo Ren, and Po. I found myself forgetting that these four were acting, because they felt real. Honestly some of the best acting I've ever seen, and I have seen A LOT of movies. 4. Let's talk about the plot. THIS PART WILL HAVE SOME SPOILERS BECAUSE I DON'T SEE ANY WAY AROUND IT. TURN BACK NOW. A lot of people have been complaining that the plot was just taken from A New Hope and Empire, and it's hard to deny that there are a lot of similarities. However, upon closer examination, these similarities really make sense. Kylo Ren is obsessed with Darth Vader. He wants to ""finish what he started"" and make him proud, right? So of course he would build a new death star! He's trying to complete Vader's legacy, which includes leading the Empire to take of the galaxy with the help of a weapon of mass destruction. This isn't lazy writing, it's actually very, very good writing. This tells us a lot about Kylo's personality. The more I think about Kylo Ren the more I realize how unstable and complex he really is, and how many layers this character has. I'm so excited to find out where the whole Vader fanboy thing will go, because I can see it becoming a major element in his ultimate fate, and that of our protagonists. Other points of the plot that fans have addressed as being ripped off are the cantina scene/the smuggler bar place (this is just stupid, can Star Wars never feature any taverns/bars/cantinas/etc. just because of one scene in the first film?) and Han's death/Rey's rescue being too similar to Obi-Wan's death/Leia's rescue. Well, the rescue isn't really similar at all. Rey isn't even rescued, she escapes on her own in a beautifully written plot twist that shows us just how strong she is with the force and makes us like her even more. What were fans expecting, for the good guys to just not try to rescue her? To just sit back and watch? Of course they had to go rescue her, so at least JJ made gave it a very different outcome. And there's the scene between Han and Kylo in which Kylo slays Han while the others watch. Yes. It is a lot like Obi-Wan's death with Vader. It's called an homage. Look it up. And not only is it an homage, it's a very good homage. As a matter of fact, it's one of the best handled homages I can recall. 5. The film had great themes, it demonstrated a great use of practical effects, and had some very intelligent writing. Fantastic in almost any way one could think of. English teachers and critics will all love it. Fans should love it, and if they don't, the only one to blame is themselves. TO CONCLUDE: If you don't like the film, fine, but know that you're only ruining it for yourself. It's an amazing movie, like it or not, and you're missing out by choosing to hate it just because there was no way it could have lived up to the hype. I mean, it is literally the most anticipated movie of all time. OF ALL TIME. Of course people will be disappointed.  "

The supporting cast is just that, a wonderful support structure to a movie that revolves not on the villain or the beauty girls (however both are wonderful), but on the Bat. I hate to say much about the movie its self, because that is the beauty of this picture, you learn with every frame who Bruce Wayne is, was, and will be. All I really can say is the Bat has returned and it is a sight to see. The only thing you can take away from this review is this. Get up.

His father is showing him the ropes and making sure he is ready for the kingdom. Simba has to go through a lot of different experiences through out the movie to shape him into the man he needs to be. Along this journey is looses his father and he is manipulated by Mustafa into thinking the death of his father was his fault.

7898,tt0468569,actressninabell,united states,9,DARK KNIGHT: An Instant Classic,"Amazing. Phenomenal. History making. Awe inspiring. These are some of the clich«∏s that came to mind after seeing DARK KNIGHT. What's not a clich«∏ is Christopher Nolan's brilliant and intricate script, beautifully crafted, all at once disturbing, funny, frightening, thought provoking and exciting. From start to finish you know you are watching quality. All involved are working to make the best film possible. The opening scene reminded me of a 1970's cop film. Like SERPICO, it has a distinct texture of grittiness and elegance. It's surprising to me how much more exciting it is to watch action sequences that are rooted in real world physics. When Batman gets punched or shot, he feels it, and so do we. The acting is excellent across the board, but two of my favorite performances were Heath Ledger's unnerving Joker; I haven't been that afraid for the other characters since Jet Li in LETHAL WEAPON 4, and Gary Oldman as the mere mortal everyman, Police Commissioner Gordon mustering every ounce of his courage to fight evil, insurmountable forces much bigger than he. The Joker is definitely the driving force of the film, with everyone having to react against his next move, and the film skillfully creates a horrible anxiety, a lot of which comes from watching the characters' resolve, wither and die when attacked by one of The Joker's hypnotic psychological barrages. Even Christian Bale's formidably played Batman, has a difficult time maintaining his composure while facing The Joker. You can see it in his eyes. A great casting twist was Eric Roberts as Gotham's mob boss Salvatore Maroni. They could have gone the route of the quintessential grease ball Italian. Instead they did something more akin to John Gotti, a smirking, unflappable, aging bad boy in an impeccable, designer suit who could almost pass for Arian. Roberts provides yet another touch of realism which adds to the film's classiness. A third character of the film is the population of Gotham itself. Too often in these films we watch the lead actors rattle on about ""saving the population"" with no real attachment with the people they are responsible for. Not so in DARK KNIGHT. The world is so rich and believable and the characters so 3 dimensional that as an audience member, you're likely to feel that you too are a citizen of Gotham, and all you'll want to do is get out of town. "
92862,tt0372784,acts2120,united states,9,a Knight worth remembering,"Finally. FINALLY!!!! I love the Batman cartoons; Justice League, and even Batman Beyond. But I tire of cartoons, and they lack visual impact. I didn't like any of Burton's versions. I never bought Keaton as the dashing billionaire playboy smart enough to pull off a double-life. I liked Val Kilmer, but thought the vehicle itself wasn't good; too campy, too over the top. But this... it simply doesn't get better. Great storyline that defines not only the character of Batman, but also of Alfred (who supports and assists Bruce in these somewhat unusual endeavors), Gordon, Lucius Fox and even the city itself and the Batcave. The history created in this story, and the characters that populate it are 100% credible. It was so real; so believable. Christian Bales was perfect as Bruce Wayne and Batman - not necessarily the most dashing of playboys, but obviously even that played into the aspect of Bruce Wayne trying to define himself and this life. Bruce Wayne was smart -really smart - and thoughtfully developed so that the audience could understand the method behind Batman's madness. Finally, The Dark Knight wasn't just a man with a grudge - or a man on a mission. He was a man with a vision who wanted to not only wanted to avenge his parents, but wanted to make criminals afraid of being criminals. And through it all, his own code defines his actions, and determines which boundaries he will and will not cross. The cast was brilliant. Top notch, in every way. I was even pleasantly surprised by Katie Holmes; she easily could have been totally overwhelmed by the quality and intensity of the performances of the other actors, but she held her own. It was distracting at times that she did look all of 18 - and it wouldn't have been difficult to mature her look, but her performance was quite credible. The gadgets - way, way cool. Way cool - totally explainable, totally believable. The cape was brilliantly defined and actualized. I've read complaints about the Batmobile not being cool enough - but I thought it was slick and MEAN. It inspired terror and intimidation - not envy or sexiness. The thing that really captured me about this movie was the reality of it; the release of all of the prisoners in Arkham - some of whom have been experimented upon by the Scarecrow and have had brain damage as a result of his toxins - are released into the general population and not recovered, which explains even that aspect of the city's character -why it seemed to attract every loon for 1000 miles!! This storyline was incredible and was very well-acted and brought to the screen with an eye for realism that places this Batman vehicle on its own well-deserved pedestal. Only one down thing: fight scenes. Too choppy, too dark. the visual of arms and legs randomly slashing across the screen was disorienting. I love a good fight scene, and this had some great -really great- moves, but it was all too fast to really appreciate. One other comment that earns an extra ""++++"" the visual violence where someone got hurt was not overdone or bloody; often it was off screen completely, and there were a whopping 3 swear words, and no sexual overtones. I didn't worry about my kids seeing this film, and finally there is a Batman movie we can all enjoy together! THIS Batman is THE Batman - an Everyman superhero for every generation.  "
139575,tt0440963,acts755,united states,1,Another Addition to the Summer of Bad Trilogies,"To begin, I want you all to know that I was excited to see this movie. I loved the first two Bourne movies and thought they got better as the stories carried on. With that said I would like to inform you that the third movie is about Jason Bourne, I know this is surprising but really guys. It is. ""This is Jason Bourne."" When sitting through the first half hour of this movie, I wouldn't be shocked if I heard that line repeated 20+ times. Holy redundancy! Okay. We get it. Jason Bourne is one guy you don't want to mess with. He shouldn't be chased or thought about unless you want your brain to spontaneously combust. After the brilliantly creative writing in the first half hour, comes Paul Greengrass' idea to recreate the hand-held camera-work that makes it seem like you are in the middle of the action, as in the Bourne Supremacy, which I liked. Although, this time Greengrass put on his silly glasses and drank a 40 of whiskey then storyboarded all the shots for the movie or maybe Greengrass just told the camera operators to do the Riverdance while shooting the scenes. It's hard to tell what he was thinking but this lasts throughout the movie and becomes very sickening. Most of the time I felt like I couldn't even see what was happening on the screen. Once I grabbed my doggy bag from the concessions area, I noticed the 3rd worst part of the movie. That is when Pamela Landy and Noah duke it out in the most annoying feud of people on the same team ever. If you want to watch two eight-year-old Nazis bicker with each other about toys or Jason Bourne, then enjoy. In case you forgot, Julia Stiles has a role in this movie. Wait. Not really. She starts to have a role in the movie and then her agent must have called her to start shooting for The Omen 2. I forgot how she is so busy with all the parts she has been taking lately and how it's good to have completely meaningless characters in movies. If you liked the resourcefulness of Bourne in the first 2 movies, you can throw that in the dumpster with this movie. A few examples are when he is riding a dirt bike away from the police, hits a curb with his front tire and the bike jumps onto a ledge five feet in the air or when he is playing bumper cars with a police car in rush hour traffic, then gets the car flipped onto a median that came from who knows where. While going probably 70+ mph and still sliding on the median, he grabs onto the seat belt holding onto dear life and ends up walking out of the crash with a few minor flesh wounds. So in summary the movie is kind of like this: Good? Who could tell? It's like watching French fries crackle along with a spew of hot bubbles in the back of a McDonald's. Do the actors act? Again, you got me. Does it make sense? Ask the scriptwriters, they'd probably know. Does it give you a headache? Hmm, about the size of Rose O'Donnell's waist line. The Bourne Ultimatum is the Blair Witch Project meets Speed meets Matrix Revolutions meets the dumbest CIA and NSA agents ever. Truthfully, I would rather eat a bowl of steaming crap while watching Home Alone 3 and Super Mario Brothers at the same time.  "

Some of the scenes didn't flow as well as they should have, I don't know if this was the editor's fault or if there just wasn't the right footage to work with. That however is easily over looked due to the quality of the rest of the film making. I would recommend this movie.  "

This really makes me doubt about how IMDb ranking works and are we the people so gullible to the advertisement campaigns that we have rated this film this high.... I must say this that the film as such is not bad. It is the best film so far this year. However it does not qualify to even come near to other masterpieces. If it is not for Heath Ledger's excellent performance, I would have rated this film even lower. To tell the truth I liked the prequel of this film better. The film is lengthy and melodramatic. e.g. the scene where inmates and civilians want to decide if they want to blow off other ship. Message was good but the way it was delivered is little bit childish. Also, transformation of Harvey Dent seems sudden and illogical. Nolan should have developed this character better. If Harvey does what he does after the death of his beloved, he should be avenging Joker. The most important part where joker convinces him to be an anarchist just like him is written poorly. All in all, it is a good movie (excuse me but far from masterpiece). "

A simple man achieved a lot knowing only just a few basic things his mother taught him. This movie is about action. There are many things to say, but it is better to watch it.

147123,tt0113247,ad_rock (adam_hopkins@hotmail.com),united kingdom,10,The world is ours.," The film La Haine is considered to be one of the most controversial, powerful and innovative films of the 1990's. It won the Best Director award in the 1995 Cannes film festival and won film of the year (1996) at the Caesar awards. La Haine (which in French means 'hate') was considered innovative because it is part of a very underused style of French cinema called 'Un Cinema de Banlieue' or 'Cinema of the Suburbs' which depicts the grim reality of France's run-down suburbs. Other films from this genre include 'Etat des lieux' (1995), and 'Bye Bye' (1996). It was considered different at the time because most French films from this period were either heritage films like 'Jean De Florette' (1985), 'Cyrano de Bergerac' (1990), and 'Manon des Sources' (1986). Or they were from the 'Cinema du Look' based on 'slick' visual style which includes such films as 'Diva' (1981), 'Nikita' (1990), and 'Subway' (1985). The cinematography in the film is very personal, and is shot almost in a documentary style, in that whenever a character or group of people moves the camera moves with them and when they stop the camera stops with them. There are also some outstanding shots in the film that continue the films theme of showing an horrific, real life situation but presenting it in an unreal way. The first of these shots is when a DJ opens his window turns his decks on and mixes Ice T's song 'Cop Killer' with old French records. As he is doing this, the camera goes over his shoulder and out of the window; it then flies over the entire estate as the music is playing in the background just to give the viewer a perspective of the dilapidated state of the estates. This is used to give the viewer a real understanding of why these people are constantly rioting against the police because they feel trapped in this urban jungle and that the police actually keep them down rather than help them. There is another shot where Vince and Hubert are standing on a raised level with the streets of Paris behind them. As they stand there the streets zoom in closer to the camera and they zoom out ever so slightly. This is a technique, which has been used many times in films, was pioneered by Steven Spielberg in the film 'Jaws'. Ever since that point it has been used by directors as a way of showing fear and tension in one shot. But typically Kassovitz inverts this theory and uses it as a way of showing how small and insignificant these characters become once they enter the big city. It is also another example of the film going against what Hollywood sets out as the norm. Another great example of the films theme of reality versus surrealism is in the way it is shot in black and white. If it were meant to have a documentary feel then it should surely be shot in color, but again Kassovitz goes against the rules of filming and shoots it in black and white to give it an unreal, dream like feel to the whole film. It also portrays the film as being straight and unrelenting, in his idea of the film as a metaphor for life, there is only black and white and no grey or colorful areas. It is also a wonderful way of making the projects in the Parisian suburbs seem even worse than they already are. The Mise-en-scene of the film plays an important part in reinforcing the traits and very individual characteristics of the main characters. The most important being Vince, the Paris native who believes himself to be from the streets and something of a rebel. His strange fixation with violence is only ever present when he is acting out violence; we see a great example of this when he is at home, in front of the mirror impersonating Robert De Niro's character from Taxi Driver. He acts out the scene in almost perfectly and at the end holds his hand up to the mirror and pulls the imaginary trigger, but we actually hear a gun shot go off. This is another hint towards Vince's delusion that his hand is a real gun and that he is some kind of thug. The same thing happens later on in the film when Vince points his hand at a cop and fires, in his mind he kills the cop but in reality nothing happens. Whenever Vince is confronted by real life opportunities to use the gun he backs out and realizes that he is nothing more than a normal man with a bad attitude. The editing in the film is kept quite simple, as to not detract from the documentary style of the camera work. However sometimes we see different speeds of fades and cuts and occasionally fades up from white instead of the usual black. This is to give a sense of surrealism and make the audience feel like this is a real life situation portrayed in an unreal 'Hollywood' way. The sound is also a very important part of the film as it gives more hints towards the influence of American Culture on the film and its inhabitants. During the scenes in Hubert's room we hear Barry White singing, which is a hint towards Hubert's wish for a calmer atmosphere, so he plays calmer music. The DJ mixes Ice T's Cop killer song with a lot of old French music which is another hint at the films apparent fusion between French and American culture. The scenes in the streets or in meeting places usually have hip-hop music playing, which is a sign of just how wide reaching American culture has become in its effect on French Popular culture. There are lots of hints towards American Culture and its influence on French Culture throughout the film. Indeed the way the film is shot is almost making fun of Hollywood's way of shooting real life situations in an 'entertaining' and 'easy to watch' way. In many ways it is Kassovitz's way of rebelling against Hollywood, by showing that he can do all the clever camera and editing techniques but accompany them with a strong script and identifiable characters. It clearly mocks Hollywood in a scene where Vince is constantly walking in and out of almost every film in the cinema complex because the films he watches are either riddled with clich«∏s or just simply really bad. This is again Kassovitz trying to make the audience see just how unrealistic and bad some mainstream films can be. In doing so he has created a film that is everything some Hollywood films try to be, cutting edge, realistic yet surreal, humorous in a dark way and extremely powerful and poetic.   "
8058,tt0468569,ad_upclose,united states,10,Brilliant Film-making!,"There comes a movie once in many years that shakes up a genre with such intensity that it ends up becoming an icon. The Lord of the Rings trilogy did it for Fantasy/epics, and now The Dark Knight has done it for superhero movies. Yes its the best one ever! C. Nolan is one of my favorite directors, and he truly comes of age with this effort. Forget the fact that its a great superhero movie, its a fantastic crime drama. The direction is superb, and Nolan has churned out a fantastic screenplay along with his brother. I am glad he also pulled up his socks on the action department (which was lacking in Batman Begins). The chase sequences and the Hong Kong venture were terrific. Nolan remains true to the dark nature of Batmans character & surroundings (aided perfectly by the fantastic score). However his two Batman films have reached such a level of excellence that I would never want to re-visit any old Batman film. I cant imagine any cast replacing Nolans. One person that certainly deserves mention is the cinematographer. Considering how dark the film is (literally) its remarkably vivid (reminiscent of the under-rated Collateral). Christian Bale is the ultimate Batman. He once again smoothly plays his tormented character & his Interrogation scene with Ledger will go down as a classic. Speaking of Ledger, he truly overshadows everyone in this film, and his screen time is satisfying. The Joker commands attention in every scene he is in, and delivers lines that will go down in cinema folklore. Heath has made joker my favorite villain along with Hopkins Hannibal. Ledger literally made Jack Nicholsons version look like a joke (that is no small feat). His voice, walk, & expressions are just perfect. The most interesting & crazy thing about him was that he had no real agenda. He wanted nothing other than chaos. Hollywood truly lost a star in the making (and is a serious blow to the potential third installment); this was going to be his launching pad to greater things. His loss will hurt the Batman franchise since the jokers story is never concluded. I will not get carried away & say that they should hand the supporting Oscar to Ledger (we have not seen the contenders). However Heath certainly deserves a nomination. Despite the dominance of the Joker, the Dark Knight is really about a white knight, Harvey Dent, played smoothly by Eckhart; could be a career-changer. His is a sad story, going from a man who prefers conventional ways to deal with crime, to becoming the maniacal Two-Face. Though his evil side gets little screen-time his character got enough time for me to empathize with his transformation (it was not as bad as how Venom was handled in Spiderman 3). Moreover, I thought the look of Two-Face was a realistic departure from the comic realm (and also nothing like Tommy Lee Jones silly version). Overall, this is a masterpiece of a movie (the best of 2008 thus far). I do not see how even Batman 3 can improve on it. I hope TDK gets some healthy Oscar nominations (at least); Ledger for best supporting actor, best director, best screenplay, best score, and best cinematography. A must-watch & must buy for all movie fans! "

The characters were given enough screen time to understand and support them through the rest of the trilogy. The visuals and effects were really nice, and the score was just perfect.

62801,tt1853728,ad_upclose,united states,9,Tarantino's western gem.,"There must be something in Tarantino's diet that makes him consistently produce these twisted and ingenious movies. Django tells a blood-soaked tale involving slavery, ruthless characters & encounters, and humor∂?the usual Tarantino recipe. The man is booked for the hall of fame but that his material continues to impress & stand-out from the crowd is remarkable. If there was one thing I have wanted to see on film it is Leo in a Tarantino movie (now I want Tom Cruise in one, being spoiled often leads to this). Leo passed on the villainous role in Inglorious Basterds, but this time he has embraced it and is having a blast with it. He plays a diabolical man with an equally conniving right hand man played by Samuel L. Jackson. The man Tarantino discovered, Christoph Waltz (who got Leo's role in Basterds in the end) is on the 'good' side this time, but is equally electric. It's funny that the title character actually takes a back-seat as the bigger supporting names take over the film. But Jamie Fox does well with what he is given, and Will Smith must be kicking himself for passing up on a Tarantino movie. This is Tarantino's longest movie, but for those of you who are familiar with his skill-set, that length should not be a concern. The long talking sequences, inspired music choice & timing, bursts of violence, and great characters make it a great package and one the best movies of the year. So long as Tarantino (his imagination at least) is in the movie business, there is always something to look forward to.  "

One of my favorite scenes in the movie is the motel one when Brolin discovers how he is being followed. It was intense and showed the quality of the directors. However, I wanted more from the ending of this film, but then again the director was merely following the book I suppose. But I feel it was not conclusive and satisfying enough, especially compared to the rest of the movie. All in all this is the best Coen brothers' movie, one that could take the cake come Oscar time.

125165,tt2267998,ad_upclose,united states,9,Fincher sticks close to his idiom and creates something exquisite & memorable.,"Gone Girl marks a kind of evolution in David Fincher's filmography. It's possibly his most provocative film along with Fight Club; one that will lead to the most conversation and filled with the most humor (the darker kind of course). It explores relationships and the media circus as well. Other than that you see what Fincher has delivered for most of his career; an engrossing, uneasy, and at times horrifying story∂?all making for an exceptional drama. It starts off as a conventional missing-person story but midway the 'mystery' is uncovered; the story has way more up its sleeve. What follows is a deliciously twisted cat-and-mouse game between characters that are going to be amongst cinema's most memorable. There is an addictive brand of insanity which unravels in Gone Girl that's previously unseen in Fincher films. An expectedly sinister mood hangs over the story which is substantially heightened by Trent Reznor's music which is largely understated but piercing in the right moments. Apart from that, the film is an exhibition of Fincher's expertise; adding layers of drama & texture leading to a climax that fulfills and even exceeds expectations. Ben Affleck gets an excellent role and displays how effective he can be given the right character. But it is Rosamund Pike who steals the show. Her performance is a revelation of sorts; playing a character that is a mere presence initially but then takes command of the story and lures us in. The supporting cast is also notable and plays to the film's advantage in many stages; Carrie Coon, Kim Dickens, and Tyler Perry excel in their parts. Overall, Gone Girl is an outstanding exercise in characters taking charge despite the concept of mystery at its core. Fincher sticks close to his idiom and creates something exquisite & memorable.

The audience can guess all they want, but Scorsese's balancing act between what is real and what is not is superb. It is not a simple twist, but a surprise with profound layers. You may have guessed it somewhat, but you will not soon forget it. Leonardo's acting is again as intense as only he can deliver, and he was phenomenal in a certain flashback towards the end. The supporting cast is bursting with talent and each and every individual delivers the goods. Overall, this movie is a real gem and people who enjoy well-crafted twists, wait till you see the ending of this one. It may be early, but this will surely be one of the best movies of 2010.  "

145643,tt1392214,ad_upclose,united states,9,Brilliant!,"Prisoners is nothing short of a scary movie; for a parent the horror will likely be tenfold. It is an engrossing& harrowing story of a father & detective taking different roads to find two abducted children. A seemingly generic plot on the surface is infused with such bone-chilling tension, dread, and artistic strokes that it eventually becomes a different beast altogether. The father is Hugh Jackman, who delivers a scorcher of a performance! Take away Wolverine's claws & replace it with raw emotional weight and you have Jackman's character Keller Dover. Jake Gyllenhaal is also incredibly impressive playing a character struggling between his procedural job & natural instincts. Terrance Howard, Viola Davis, & Paul Dano also put in excellent performances in their respective supporting roles. The movie, a long procedural hearkens back to Fincher's murder mysteries. In fact, given the pace, narrative quality, & sharp editing one could be excused for mistaking it as such. That is a well-earned compliment for the director Denis Villeneuve. Although in a different context when compared to Seven, the film possesses a layer of religious insinuation that adds interest to the story-structure. The film proudly shows off Roger Deakins cinematography in what may be his best work considering that this is not a spectacle movie or one shot in some iconic location. His skills elevate the production with gorgeous lighting & camera-angles. It is a technical aspect many will overlook in the dreary setting of the story, but is major strength of the film. Nowhere is it punctuated better than in a brief night-time driving sequence towards the end of the film. Overall, Prisoners is a dramatic & nerve-grinding thriller of the highest order. It is a slow-burn drama that is a fitting companion-piece to films like Seven & Zodiac.  "

He may not be the best, but his vision of bringing dinosaurs to the big screen could not have been more perfect. He awakens our long ""extinct"" fear of dinosaurs as if they actually existed in our lifetimes. One of my childhood favorites that brings chills to my spine every time I watch. Sometimes I wonder why not many others have tried a dinosaur film, but by the time I'm at the final scene, the reason is obvious. Spielberg hits the nail on the head and captures all the emotion and excitement of being ""thrown into the mix"" with a species on the other side of 65 million years. In my opinion, it is the most original blockbuster from Spielberg, and the technology used to depict the dinosaurs has inspired many directors to tackle the unknown, most recently we can witness an inspired scene from Terrence Malick's ""The Tree of Life"". In this scene we see the exact message Spielberg was trying to get across in 1993: dinosaurs were powerful and terrifying but at the same time intelligent and truly beautiful creatures. Epic.  "

The film is about a diamond, while a lot of storys are going on a once it all boils down to the one thing, The Diamond. Excellent performances by Brad Pitt, as well as everyone else, while a serious film it is a mix between comedy aswell with Sol, Vinny and Tyrone providing some great laughs. Now onto Guy Richie, he has made this film superb, the music is brilliant, the camera angles is great and the parts from introducting all the characters to the part where Avi comes to London. The boxing scenes are great especiailly at the end. What more can I say about Snatch?? Great Film, Great Music, Great directing, Great actors, Great story, Great comedy, In general go and buy it and I gurantee personally you will not be disapointed. I give the film a Strong 9.5/10 and agree that it is much better then Lock Stock! Adaceg  "
50798,tt0407887,adachoiwk,Hong Kong,8,Good movie,"For every HK people, The Departed must be one of the movies that most yearned for. But many HKers find it disappointing as Departed did not bring out the marrow of the original -- both moles living in ""wo jin dao"" (the Chinese name of the original, meaning the lowest level of the hell) -- and lost the tension between the FOUR leading roles -- Ming (Billy in Departed), Yan (Colin), Sam (Costello) and Wong (missing character, the role is functionally shared by Martin Sheen and Mark Walhberg). Without these two elements, Departed, from my point of view, is only a good, entertaining, well performed movie. The Departed has shortened the time that Billy was put in the gang (nine years in the original to one), weakening the complexity of Billy's situation that he may not be able to turn back to be a good guy. And it makes Colin's fast lifting career less logical. After erasing Wong's role, the film just losses the ""cat"" in the ""cat catching mice"" game, leaving Costello an ordinary but crazy gang boss, while in the original, the interaction between Sam (Costello's role) and Wong is a very interesting line. One more thing, about the micro chip scene, it just doesn't make sense that the Chinese speak Cantonese for such a deal by PRC agency. They should speak Mandarin!!! Cantonese is only used in Hong Kong, and part of the Guangdong Province!!! And if they really want to use Cantonese, please find somebodies that speak REAL Cantonese!!! What they are speaking is like English-accent Cantonese and every people in the cinema just cannot stop laughing at their tone. And the script is wrong in meaning too, such that ""fong de cheong"" (meaning put down the guns) was read as ""fong cheong"" (don't have such phase in Cantonese, but somewhat implies the meaning of ""to fire"").

40777,tt0120815,adalmin,singapore,10,"Best buddy movie ever (please, don't flame me).","It's a buddy movie. I'd love to get on my soapbox and quote 'Henry V' at you all day long, but the bottom line is, this movie is all about buddies. I am not interested in molecularly accurate historical fact, so I wasn't bombed out by some small insignificant detail. Instead, I chose to feel how these men, these ordinary men, felt, and how they treated each other. I griped a bit about the lack of back-stories about some of the men (like Reiben or Jackson), but then I realized that they were just like you and me. We all know the story of you and me, and the story moves confidently because of that, without being bogged down by too many flashbacks to an earlier life that would have hurt the pacing. The cinematography is really good because you get close-ups on their faces a lot of the time, and other close-ups on important things like hands and bleeding corpses and so on (unlike We Were Soldiers, which suffered from too many wide shots). As a result, you get to see every little crook in their expressions and every facial tic, so you feel for them much more. Focusing on Tom Hanks' hands was one of the most well-chosen shots ever, because it showed the vulnerability of the man without too much exposition or violence. Additionally, let me say that all the actors put in their best performances for this movie. While Matt Damon was a little stiff, the rest were Oscar gold as they grimaced and swore through the movie, and there was never the 'politically correct' feeling that crippled other war movies. I'd like to highlight three awesome actors who deserve to be paid in nothing but solid Academy gold. Medic Wade, played by Giovanni 'Vonnie' Ribisi, Corporal Upham, played by Jeremy Davies, and of course the lead actor himself, Tom Hanks in the role of John Miller. All three delivered powerful (in Upham's case, powerfully pathetic) performances, and the final scene, you truly get to see the groundbreaking ability of Tom Hanks. Ribisi is notable because of one particular conversation that, if handled by a lesser actor, would be merely melodramatic. One minor quibble is the beginning and ending scenes, which were completely out of step with the 'buddy buddy' feeling that permeated this movie. While the resolution does tie up all the loose ends, it just makes it so...flat. But it's a minor quibble nonetheless. The plot itself is paced well, the actors are brilliant, the script is sharp and honest, the gore is substantiated and not overdone, so what's stopping you from watching this movie?  "

36058,tt0102926,Adam,united states,5,"Watch this BEFORE reading the book, or watching Red Dragon","Having read both Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs, and having seen the movie adaptations of each (in that order), this movie was somewhat disappointing to me. My two major complaints are with the pace and with some of the acting. To start, the pace of the movie as compared to the book is cut all to hell. Of course things would need to be shortened or refitted from novel to feature length movie, but much of the insight into several characters and their relationships is either rushed or utterly lost. Jack Crawford's personal back story, for instance, is completely left out; this leaves Scott Glen nothing to work with, though we know from past roles that he is at least an able actor Jodie Foster is contemptible as Clarice Starling. In T. Harris's well-written book, she is portrayed as frustrated and sometimes disturbed, but able, rebellious and determined. In this movie she is almost constantly falling apart and is barely able to keep herself together. Further, the reason for involving her so heavily in the case, while addressed in the book, is never properly explained here. To the movie's credit, and ironically, the characters we are supposed to like least are the most believable, and provoke the most reaction: Ted Levine as Buffalo Bill, Anthony Heald as Dr. Chilton and of course Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. With a change of director, and screenwriter Ted Tally's growth over 11 years, Red Dragon is much more reflective of its source material, much more insightful, has a much better lead actor and is simply better all around. One will enjoy this movie as a thriller IF one does not first read the book, or see the much more ably-handled Red Dragon.  "

So I bought it went back to my trailer put it in and after it was done I needed to sit on the couch for a couple minutes to take it all in. I had just witnessed a cinematic masterpiece! This film is my favourite movie and I could watch it over and over again. Well let me just tell you what the film is about. This film is about 13th century Scot William Wallace, who leads a Scottish rebellion against the British during the Scottish Independence wars.

104929,tt0112641,Adam,united states,8,Change,"I once saw a small piece of Casino, one of the later scenes in the movie between Robert DeNiro and Sharon Stone. Based on the scene, without knowing what was going on, I formed a notion that the movie was another loudmouthed violence film. I mentally, subliminally, resisted seeing it for the six or seven years since, even after taking in Goodfellas. It was seeing The Departed--twice--that convinced me to look into the picture. Everything that can be said about its direction, camera-work, style, dialogue and overall quality has probably been said. But one thing that most reviewers have overlooked, and a nuance of the movie that I believe provides much pleasure in the watching, is how it addresses change. In this light we may interpret Scorcese's shots of coins running through the casino, like blood through veins, as sly visual clues. On into the movie, Pesci and Stone share a line about how DeNiro's character has ""changed."" But one of the points Casino attempts to make is that no one really does change, no matter how hard they may or may not try, and no matter how hard someone tries to make them. After all of his friend's warnings and urgings, Pesci remains the hardheaded opportunist gangster; despite his old friend's growing disgust, DeNiro continues to try to make money within Vegas's politicized atmosphere; and Stone goes steadily along a destructive path to as much money and material goods as she can lay her hands on. One of the genius things about the film, if so instinctive and everyday for us viewers as to be almost subliminal, is that the story is situational. Situations change, relationships between characters may change, but the characters themselves rarely do. The ways they react to these changes around them may or may not be expected, but they are the ways real people would react. Pesci and DeNiro were always a thug and a penny-pincher, respectively, but they grew up as friends; their surroundings never created a conflict between them before they went to Vegas. Similarly, Stone always coveted the material, but her new relationship with DeNiro begins to strain her sense of independence. This is a movie that functions in layers of action and psychology: violence as a means to an end, the effects of power and greed, the straining of relationships, how we adapt to new situations, etc. All played out by a cast of very capable actors by the hand of a very able director.

96091,tt0105695,Adam (imp_85),canada,9,An amazing movie that is the final chapter in the western genre," Yes, I may be biased in favor of Clint Eastwood movies (the Dirty Harry's & his Spaghetti Westerns), but this one is undeniably amazing. Directed by the squint-eyed one himself, this is a great story that examines every aspect of the western genre. Like a jibe at his previous efforts that prided their violent content, ""Unforgiven"" examines the emotions and motives that drives men, both of the law and outside it, to do evil. Each actor in this film plays a character of extreme depth and importance. Clint wonderfully portrays an aged widower and recovering alcoholic who is drawn from raising his two young children back to the violence of his past. In his younger days, his violent tendencies were legendary and his later life has been spent fighting to put it behind him. Eastwood's character is constantly tortured by the moral battle within himself that is being fueled by the wickedness of the world around him. There are also several wonderful actors of the leading calibre who put their extreme talents to work in the supporting role. Morgan Freeman, Richard Harris and Saul Rubinek each offer a character who do not comfortably fit into the basic categories of the American Western where characters wore either a black or white hat. Rather they have characteristics that make them indefinable in simple terms. Finally comes the character of Little Bill who is played to absolute perfection by the always superb Gene Hackman (who won a Best Supporting Oscar for this role). He is the perfect ""villain"" for this story that questions the role of evil. Hackman is the sheriff of a small town who is respected by his subordinates and outlaws alike. He maintains peace in his town through ferocious acts that either leave the recipient viciously beaten or dead. And that is what makes his character fascinating. The majority of the audience is in favour of a law-abiding society, but this makes us question at what cost we want law and order. There are also moments where Little Bill is not acting in his role as sheriff but of laid-back homebody who enjoys making home rennovations and joking with towns-people. He is not a cartoonish villain whose singular purpose is evil, but a complex man who wants to do his job to the best of his ability and in the end to retire. His acts of cruelty while on the job have the purpose of maintaining the peace and Hackman's character does not question the means to achieve that goal. The movie then asks us if violence is necessary to put an end to Little Bill's ways, therefore continuing the cycle. As far as I'm concerned, this is the final chapter of the Western. Clint, a true trail-blazer of the genre revisits the territory as a character and film-maker and demonstrates that violence begets violence and the toll it can take on the human soul. All this makes ""Unforgiven"" more than a simple Western, but also an examination of man living in a society and the role of violence.  "

118066,tt2488496,Adam Amin,united kingdom,4,Underwhelming,"tl:dr - Watch once but doubt you'll bother watching it again. Main review: Similar to others, I was happy to hear that Abrams would be directing this sequel but I should've known better. Also, just like others, I became a fan of Abrams with Lost and Cloverfield. However, as time has gone by, I'm now of the opinion that he doesn't actually do anything special with any of the movies that he directs. And this is just the latest example. I mean, how can you not get Star Wars right? The immensity of the lore gives you endless possibilities to work with. Unfortunately, it feels as if he just wanted to play it safe by using the same old formula and just not willing (Or able?) to think up anything original. Iconic characters from the original Trilogy just seemed so out of place in this movie. It's almost like he didn't have a clue as to what to do with them. Don't get me wrong, some of the scenery and effects in this movie were good to see. Kylo was okay and some of the sequences were good to watch but it just didn't save the movie. If you removed the Star Wars name and all lightsabers, this probably would've been seen as a terrible movie and be going at 2/10 on IMDb but, because it's Star Wars, it's rated highly. There was just something that.. I'm not sure what it was but something was missing. I still can't put my finger on it. The plot started off okay but seemed all over the place as the movie progressed. Okay, a planet got blown up - So what? I couldn't care less. Snoke? Don't care. Kylo? Apart from some stuff he did, who cares? The First Order? Don't care. Why even have Phasma there if you can't make her seem cool or do anything useful? To be honest, I had a hard time caring even when Han, Leia or even Luke made an appearance. Barely anything made me care about any of the characters, even the original ones - And I LOVED the Originals and Prequels. The whole thing seemed bland, dull and boring for the most part. And Abrams, in my view, is to blame. I have no idea why this is 8.4/10 on IMDb as I type this. And that's excluding all the problems with the plot, some of which are below: - A planet-sized ""Starkiller"" was made within 30 years? Using what resources? How? Where did they get the people from given the size of the First Order? - Finn just happened to walk in the right direction in the desert and meet Rey? Er, okay. - Oh, how convenient that the Millennium Falcon was there to help them escape. - Oh, Poe died? Hmm. Oh wait, now he's not? Oh.. okay? - How convenient that Rey seems to fly the Falcon so well and take out the bad guys. - How convenient that Han finds their ship at the perfect time. - How convenient that Han has gone back to who he used to be and Leia is in a similar position as in the original movies (omg look! she is a born rebel!! omg). - How convenient that they find Luke's lightsaber. - Rebels save the day at the perfect time! - Let's blow up a planet that we don't care about to show how powerful this new weapon is. Oh, you were targeting the Senate.. Er, okay? Who cares? - How convenient that Finn et al sneak into the enemy camp (""Starkiller"") and walk around without being caught. You'd think something of that size would have millions of troops. - Yes Rey, escape but not do the obvious and wear a Stormtrooper uniform to blend in. - Oh look, Rey can now climb walls and knows what button to press to go wherever she wants because.. Well, who cares. - Oh look, let's kill Han for shock value in one of the lamest ways possible. - Let's also shoot random stuff to blow up the Starkiller as Poe did. Because shooting at random stuff always works if you don't know what you're doing. Rest assured, as always, it's all good because the good guys will get away because that's how below average movies work. Please. All that I thought at the end of the movie was that Disney made a mistake by not allowing Lucas to work in some major capacity on the sequels. At least the prequels, even with problems, were good to watch. TFA wasn't good to watch but actually boring in various places. I'm hoping Rian Johnson learns and improves on the below-average plot for Episode VII as he directs Episode VIII otherwise, if I were Disney, I'd seriously start reassessing how to proceed forward with the franchise.

65936,tt1345836,Adam Andersson,sweden,10,Probably the 'best' movie I've ever seen,"So now it's almost 1 year ago I saw this movie for the first time. I like to base my vote after what I thought of the movie the first time I saw it. After I saw TDKR the first(out of four) time in the theatre I was completely speechless. I had very, very high expectations since Batman Begins were my favorite movie at that time and The Dark Knight was also a clear 10 out of 10. I must've had goosebumps pretty much 70% of the movie during my first watch, it was that spectacular. The sad thing with this is that everything I watch nowadays just seems mediocre. Sure, there have been a lot of movies which have been given a lot of high scores on IMDb, and I've pretty much seen every one of them at the theatres. I cannot help but comparing them to TDKR(even tho they're not in the same genre) which leaves me rather disappointed after every visit to the theatres. And yes I know this movie got some plot-holes in it but why should I care about these when I didn't care about them the first time I saw the movie?

So the acting's dull, the fighting-scenes are lame and the music is awful, but the biggest problem of the all must be the lack of tension in this movie. As you watch the movie you'll know exactly how the end's gonna be like and that no important character at all will die.

150732,tt1663202,Adam Baehr,united states,10,The Indomitable Spirit of Revenge is Cold Hearted!!!!!,Holy Smokes. I just finished watching this captivating movie a little while ago and it was Absolutely Phenomenal. I will start with the story which is about the explorer named Hugh Glass who is left for dead by a friend after a brutal bear attack in the American Frontier of 1823. The story is extremely solid especially since it's based on a true story. I did find the story dragging a few times but it doesn't take off of the score. I will now move onto the acting which was Breathtaking with both Tom Hardy and Leonardo DiCaprio playing their roles to Perfection like in every movie they have ever done prior. I must say that the two of them together make for one Hell of a powerful movie experience. The other actors played their roles just as well even though they were minor in comparison. I will now move onto the action which was if I dare say the most Savage and Barbarous Adaptation of combat during that time period which took place on the American Frontier of the 1800's. I mean it was Masterfully shot and truly one of a kind even to present day Military movies. The military movies of today pale in comparison to just how Ruthless it was back then for the men who fought. I will now move onto the Cinematography which was done by Emmanuel Lubezki which is a Master of his Arts. I mean they shot the film in both Canada and Argentina and a small part in America but the dedication it takes to travel all the way to South America for snow just to double as the American Frontier says volumes on how dedicated the cast and crew were on this film. I can't stress enough how visually stunning the shots were and how realistic it all felt and the music was on point even though it was sparse it was still Amazing. I will close with this statement and that is that you must go and watch this film. I mean it's one of the Best Films and the most refreshingly original films in terms of the cinematography and the depth of the characters will power to evoke just how Indomitable the human body and the human spirit can be when it wants something bad enough.  
5692,tt0071562,Adam Bernstein (zensixties),united states,6,Weak Soap-Operaish Followup to much better Original,"Godfather Part 2 is so hailed as the greatest film of all time it's time someone burst that overblown bubble and I've got the needle right here. So let's take a closer look at what should be considered a mediocre sequel to the classic film, The Godfather. First of all Marlon Brando is nowhere to be seen here. Instead we get random flashbacks to Robert Deniro as the young Vito. We get some good scenes of old Little Italy though there's a Keystone-cops feel to some of it, especially the comic relief of the slumlord scene.  Part 2 has a much bigger budget but a script with weakened plot lines and dialogue, basically trying to followup everything from Part 1 logically becoming formulaic and soap-operaish, and ending up falling flat.  The film begins with another celebration of some kind. A brother's betrayal aspires to be that of Hamlet, but without the depth or wit (or brevity). It's now the 1950s and Mike is in Nevada and is trying to buy a corrupt Senator. The Senator is I suppose the film producer element of the first, but with nothing creative like a horse head...just crass dialogue that doesn't ring true. We also get a Mafia hearing in Congress which should have ended up on the cutting room floor. We also get (the great?) Lee Strasberg as some old shirtless and feeble mobster. He may be a great teacher, but someone tell me why this is an Academy Award winning acting performance! Am I just dumb? Al Pacino is great as always, this performance following Serpico, but his dialogue doesn't ring true. When he begins, ""If history has taught us anything.."" I expect some deep wisdom to follow...needless to say it doesn't. Talia Shire's character is also weakened compared to the original's Connie. Here she just ""needs money"" and wants Mike to forgive Fredo because ""he's so sweet"". This mess of a sequel ends with a literal bloodbath, but following the formula of the first, and a final scene with the original cast (sans Brando) the actors of which were paid more than all their good work in the original. I'm not saying it isn't worth seeing, just that it's inferior to the original in many ways. But of course it isn't near as bad as Part 3. My final criticism is that all these mob films intentionally or not glorify criminals. Okay, now you can click ""no"". "
46495,tt0054215,Adam Bernstein (zensixties),united states,6,"Great film making, but lets face it: this plot and dialogue are weak","Psycho is so overpraised as the greatest horror film of all time that it's hard to break the trend, but here goes. One obvious weakness is the utter ridiculousness of Norman's insanity. I mean, come on! He becomes his mother after he kills her? That would be the only case in all of human history I believe. And the psychologist figures the whole thing out after like 10 minutes with him? The other weaknesses concern the whole film prior to arrival at the Bates Motel. We get a mediocre beginning with Janet Leigh and that guy in the hotel room; I don't find her attractive--sorry. Why is it exactly they were keeping the affair secret? Who knows and who cares. Then some rich Texan comes in, Hitch's non-actress daughter has the part and says ""I declare!"" He says ""I don't, that's how I get to keep it."" Cheap dialogue really. Then Leigh steals the money and drives away, then buys a new car which does nothing, but raise the suspicion of a cop and car dealer? This film would be completely forgettable if not for the great Anthony Perkins, the great film soundtrack, and a great director. To drive my point home, imagine the film without the soundtrack and cutting out the Anthony Perkins scenes. What have you got left: mediocrity!  "
144724,tt0107048,Adam Bernstein (zensixties),united states,4,Cheap laughs and over-sentimentality wrapped up in an interesting concept,"Some of the more profound implications of the scenario were unfortunately scrapped to play to a mainstream audience. Though in the surface a good vehicle for Bill Murray, the cons outweigh the pros. There is at least one implication of the scenario overlooked by almost everyone: namely if Bill Murray lives the same day over and over then what happens to everyone else in the world? The only possible solution to this, considering no one else is living it over and over (that we know of), is the many worlds theory. So each new twist of the day creates a new scenario that of course gets played out in the universe that the film's Phil doesn't get to see. So when Phil commits suicide, he really DOES die in that alternate world. And each Phil goes onto the next day with everyone else in the world. So what's happening obviously is his MEMORIES of reliving the same day with different scenarios keep building up more and more. So how do these memories get transmuted back to him each 6AM on February 2nd? The original script explained it as a former girlfriend casting a spell on him. In reincarnation theory what dies isn't consciousness, but memory, and some anecdotes exist of those who recall past lives. So what could account for Phil? Somehow the spell would have to stop the death of memory so he not only keeps remembering the future 24 hours, but remembers all the OTHER future 24 hours. The writer estimated 10 years worth, though the original script called for 10,000 years worth of Feb. 2s, which as you can imagine would make this that much more hellish. The fact that Phil starts out each day the same physically shows that the only thing caught in the time loop is his memory. Now, much of the dialogue is strictly cheap laughs (""ever had Deja Vu?"" ""I'll see if it's on the menu"" and such). But as far as any overall message it gets lost in over-sentimentality, especially at the end. The message is suppose to be that we must keep repeating things until we get them right; problem is the way Phil chooses to get things right is to YES, use tricks to get what he wants, which is Rita (Andie MacDowell). The first night he gets her home she is wise to him, but the last he so utilizes the tricks as to impress her beyond belief. Remember that close to t helast night he tells her the truth of how he knows so much, but NOT the last ""perfect"" day. On THAT day he basically lies to her by impressing her WITHOUT telling her the reason he is able to do so. So actually the film's moral reads: become a master of deceit to get what you want. If the film took the more profound path instead of playing to the mainstream it would have been a great film. As it is it a mediocre comedy with a twist.  "

But if you have read the books and are a ""Tolkien geek"" like me, you might be a little disappointed. I don't want to give anything away, but they have changed a lot more from the book for this movie than they did for Fellowship. And sometimes what they changed just doesn't make any sense. It all starts to noticeably change when they leave for Helm's Deep; also, Frodo and Sam's encounter with Faramir is drastically different. It still works for the movie, I suppose, and people who haven't read the books wouldn't have a problem. Aside from those differences, it is still amazing. The amount that has been changed can almost be forgiven by the amount of little details they managed to include!  "
52492,tt0088763,Adam Blutt (adammblutt@gmail.com),united states,10,Perfection,"When it comes to not only incredible storytelling yet a truly great example of what a film should be, this and the entire trilogy define an undeniably 'timeless' experience that are forever lasting. Few times does a story introduce characters the way in which this does while at the same time delicately setting up what will become larger plot points. At every turn, there's another little surprise that lures the viewer in more and more. I think what's most profound here as opposed to other films similar to the genre is that although it's about time travel, it's moreover about people and relationships over anything else. Somehow, the writers prevent the story from getting bogged down in technical jargon and instead have smartly allowed the story of these characters to be present above all else. In summation, constantly entertaining and forever remarkable.  "
142662,tt1201607,Adam Bogoch,canada,10,"Do not Pity the Dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, all those who live without love.","Love. The main theme of all the Harry Potter films, and novels. It is also why this series works. The cast and crew... and Rowling, love these characters, and this world. So we are meant to love it too. I had my hopes up, growing up, expecting the catharsis of what feels like graduation from childhood, dreams, and magic. And being a fan of the adaptations of J.K.'s novels to film, I had high hopes. Were they met? Mostly, yes. I do think in many ways this picture was stolen by Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman. It is so obvious how fine an actor Ralph is... he's done some pretty stellar work. Here, he is menacing and truly 'evil'. He does this well. However it is the two sides of him we had yet to see in his interpretation of Voldemort that impressed me most. His dark wit, and his utter vulnerability and fear of his own demise. This is so evident in his performance. One of the greatest antagonists of all time. Bravo Ralph!!! Alan's character, Snape has obviously been a fan favourite and his big reveal has been much awaited. What a great character by Rowling, and what a great performance from Rickman, he plays him with such inner conflict. He shows that no mater what genre a film is, good acting... is good acting. In this apocalyptic reunion film, we get to see the group of talent faces that have joined this series over the last 10 years. The cast is a true accomplishment. They are, without a doubt, the finest actors out there. Even in smaller roles, Maggie Smith shines with love, the down Jason Isaacs, the lovable Julie Walters, the intelligent Michael Gambon, and Robbie Coltrane who is viciously underused but still the lovable Hagrid we grew up with. But my all time favourite goes to the wickedly evil, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She is underused... that is a downfall of this picture. She is talked about more then she is present. Oh well, she makes the most of what she is given. Bonham Carter not only gets to play the sadistic woman madly in love with Voldemort (we get to see a little more of this), but she gets to play Emma Watson's Hermione as well. Helena you are my all time favourite actor, and you do Potter proud! A big hand out to other underused, but much appreciated faces of the Potter family, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Miriam Margolyes, the remarkable Jim Broadbent, Warwick Davis (not so under used... but still), John Hurt, Mark Williams, Kelly Macdonald, George Harris, Emma Thompson, Gemma Jones, David Bradley, Ciaran Hinds, and the finally used Helen McCroy... she does a good job here. The youngest cast members have not only grown up with us, but also turned into talented young actors. Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe... who I liked but often found wooden, does great work here! As an actor he deals with some of the more difficult emotions... again he does this so well here! Bravo Daniel. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (who is so beautiful) feel like the audience's best friends as well as Harry's. I can't think of a better compliment. And their much awaited kiss... is absolute perfection. Bonnie Wright's Ginny feels present and talented. Evanna Lynch has a great career ahead of her, her Luna is eccentrically groovy. Tom Felton is typical... he's given stuff to do... I guess, and he does a good job of what he has. Matthew Lewis has screen time. Kloves wrote well for him, and his delivery is sweet and courageous. His exchange with Voldemort in the courtyard, as Bellatrix laughs in the background, is one of the best scenes in the series! As for the other familiar faces of the Hogwarts students, good and bad, a shout out to you guys! Technically ""Deathly Hallows part 2"" is completely Oscar worthy. I do not pass this sentiment off easily. But it is. Cinematorgraphy is stunning, striking strong imagery. The production design is absolutely flawless, with such incredible detail that not everyone sees, you my friends need an Oscar! The editing is sharp, and the sound design is terrific. But what steals it all is Alexandre Desplat's touching score. It evokes true emotion, throwing in enough of John William's score, but also adding his own mark on Harry Potter history. The writing is the best it's been and never rushed. The direction by Yates is wonderful. You can tell he truly cares about the characters and what they're going through. Would I have liked him to show more of the supporting cast, especially during the battle... yes, but we all can't get what we want. There are times where it feels a little rushed, the whole film could have been 10 minutes longer, and most of my issues could have been fixed by that. A couple plot holes, nothing major, but a couple. A huge thank you to all the cast and crew, every single person who put their heart and soul into this film, and the series it concludes. You have brought forth J.K.'s world, creating one that was easily attainable to children, but also philosophically for all ages. We deal with some huge themes here, love and death being the biggest. This is a fantastic, gripping, incredibly poignant and tender film, with all the magic and wonder of the first, and the excitement and climax of what the last film should be! See this film in 2D, as it should properly be seen.  "
20567,tt0120737,Adam Boyd (design@shinydesign.com),united states,10,An Excellent Film in its Own Right," I understand that many of the Tolkien faithful may look upon FOTR with utter disdain. I feel sorry for those people who can have such hatred for a thing of such magnificent beauty. Rarely is there a film experience available to us that is so finely crafted as Peter Jackson's 'Fellowship'. And while this film is not flawless, it is about as near perfect as a film can get. What makes this film so entertaining? That answer will be different for everyone, but for me, it's the wonderful reality that this film has no dull moments, no empty spaces -- WHATSOEVER. There's always a beatiful landscape, some witty dialog, a little dash of humor or some serious action to keep us -- well, just plain excited. I've viewed the film three times as of the date of this writing, and I can say that it has lost none of its luster. It truly lives up to (or exceeds) the hype (at least the hype that existed in my own mind), and also to my expectations. Here comes the bad part, but unlike other people, I'll attempt to keep myself objective. The main complaint that I have with the film is this: the fight scenes, while visually stunning, have some choppy editing. In other words, the fights are more like Braveheart and less like Gladiator or, say, The Phantom Menace. I felt that the film could've given us breathtaking shots of orcish ass-kickings, and it just fell short. They end up oftentimes being confusing, and too ""up close and personal"", failing to give you a sense of the overall battle going on. I speak specifically about the final battle; Moria, in my opinion, was a little better, but still insufficient. We really don't get a sense of the battle prowess of Gandalf either. These are the types of things I feel Peter Jackson could've taken advantage of, yet for some reason or another, did not. However, the fight scenes are, ultimately, good enough and accomplish their goal. The only other problem, in my opinion, is that some of the computer generated shots were obvious. This, I believe, could've been avoided to some extent. It's obvious that inordinate amounts of time were spent on the balrog (which looked unbelievably good, by the way), while less time was spent making the human CGI a little more fluid and lifelike. This is a minor beef though, perhaps miniscule would be better placed here than minor. Back to the good side. The casting was-without a doubt-perfect. You will notice that even the most ludicrous of nay-sayers will not even come close to using the word ""miscast"". Most of the actors seem to literally become their respective character, and those that don't still do an excellent job. Ian McKellen deserves an Oscar, and I will say that about few actors, especially this year. The special effects are excellent on the whole as well, easily rivaling ILM's latest achievements. The scenery and cinematography are also excellent. Not enough can be said about scenery, FOTR is quite possibly the most amazing indirect travel brochure New Zealand will ever see. I agree with every single change Peter Jackson & Co. made to this film. The omissions make sense, the film is already bordering epic length, all the while not skipping a beat. Tom Bombadil would've been nice, but PJ just didn't have enough screen time to work with. Arwen is a female character that needs developing early on, since there aren't a lot of female characters in the film and we need a romantic sub-plot. It brings a more ""human"" feel to the supernatural goings-on. Every extra moment PJ spent on making us feel the ""weight"" of the wring on both Frodo and the Fellowship were well spent. Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a masterpiece. A film that literally has it all. It is unique, and engulfing; a perfect balance of all the elements that make movies great. Ultimately, as this movie is viewed more by the public, we will understand better just how wonderful it really is. A film that is greater than the sum of its parts. Pure cinematic magic.

Private Ryan, from a purely cinematographic point of view, is an absolute masterpiece, an exploration of the uses of cinematography in a studio film must be applauded for doing so. However, the script leaves something to be desired. The characters are cardboard cutouts (you know a character is when you can describe him in a few words) and the fact that the theme is practically drilled into our skulls by the book-ending modern day sequences should be insulting to the intelligence of every audience member watching. Spielberg deserves applause for his technique in Saving Private Ryan, but how it got filmed in the first place on the basis of its script is beyond me.  "

62852,tt1853728,Adam Centurione,canada,7,"Tarantino is licking Leono's bowl clean, and claiming the recipe as his own.","I'd like to start off with pleading to anyone who has the intent on watching this film, or any Tarantino film to hold that thought and first think about watching Sergio Leone's 'Money Trilogy'. Seriously, think about it, ""I am going to watch Leone's 'Money Trilogy'"". Rather, A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, The Ugly; since it isn't actually a trilogy. Now, this may seem like a horrifically low budget advertisement for a set of films that were created well before my birth. Take note though, that this 'trilogy' was also created well before Tarantino started making films, and I argue that everything Tarantino seems to be acclaimed for is none other than a petty rip off of Leone's glorious masterpiece. (Of which were one was a remake of an even older Japanese film∂?) Certainly without a doubt, Django Unchained is a reproduction of the 'spaghetti western' style. In fact it is so much of Leone's style, that it goes as far as to replicate almost everything those films had, except Tarantino sucks, so he turns this bad-ass style into an overdone piece of Hollywood crap that, if it were a motorcycle, would no doubt begin falling apart when travelling at high-speed. The central plot targets a bounty hunter, until half way through when it in fact targets slave's efforts at reuniting with his wife. I thought that was in poor taste, as 1) the ending was crap, 2) westerns are better off focusing on things like gold, money, or bandit's corpses, not love and riding off towards the sunset. The film also incorporates music that is so much like Ennio Morricone's compositions, except that they weren't. The tunes would have three or four notes excerpts of a piece from Money Trilogy, and swerve into another direction of much lesser quality. ""Well of course, that's just what Tarantino wanted!"" Yet that's just the problem, it has been done before, the music, the characters, the plot (except the love story) the action, it's all been done. Tarantino just rips off Leone. Even the way he shoots, close ups, pan outs; really though I am not familiar with the terminology, I feel confident saying that Tarantino is no good. Aside from Tarantino's distasteful wielding of the spaghetti western, the acting in Django Unchained is, for the most part, quite good. Christopher Waltz is particularly good, his calm demeanour and professionalism is appreciated. Jamie Foxx is mediocre, certainly nothing widely credible. I found the scene where Foxx's character attempts to read rather ridiculous, as I find it hard to believe that any American Slave would have even been able to understand the phonetics of English, let alone read a letter, or whatever it was; albeit rather poorly. DiCaprio was also notably good. Samuel L. Jackson was clever and funny, although generally the same character he was in every other movie∂? perhaps just more suitable in this position. Thus before you watch another Tarantino movie and go on rambling about how bad-ass he is, watch Leone's stuff. A Fistful of Dollar, For a Few Dollars More, The Good, The Bad, The Ugly and A Fistful of Dynamite a.k.a. Duck You Sucker! They are the real classics that can't nor shouldn't be replicated in such poor taste. Tarantino continues to direct in a manner which I find corny in the sense that it is overdone and poorly imagined. Django Unchained is his statement of that.  "
94365,tt0372784,Adam Cox,united states,10,"my first and only IMDb commentary, GREAT MOVIE FOR ALL!!!","Being bored and in Atlanta, Georgia for a conference, I decided to go see Batman Begins as I had free time and wanted to see what the hype was all about. I wasn't expecting much out of a movie being based off of a comic book, ie Fantastic Four, Spiderman to some extent, and the PG-13 rating made me scared that I was going to go see a movie marketed towards kids with childish themes. What I got was a dark experience on the little known background of Bruce Wayne and Batman, full of action, emotion that wasn't over the top but extremely believable, and balanced philosophical outlook on justice and morality. This is definitely a movie for those who want to delve deep into morality and justice, but is full of action and suspense and dry humour to keep the ordinary fan edged to their seats. The CGI was awesome but the acting was even better (albeit I think they should have picked another girl in Katie Holmes place, say a little larger Asian girl instead? to make the movie seem more realistic, as all the actors were pretty and polished.) A must see for all. Kids, adults, cynics, thrill-seekers, Batman Begins provides enough for all type of movie-goers. We all grew up watching Batman but few know the true background of him, and this movie explains a lot without getting too caught up in the explanation because it provides an exciting story.

17709,tt0137523,Adam D.,canada,10,Holy.," I know I sound like a pandering idiot saying this (that or a marketer for Fox) but this was simply one of the best American films I think I've ever seen. David Fincher has intrigued me since I saw Alien3. At the time he was an untested talent and was largely known for making music videos. Wow have times changed. Everyone knows him best for Seven now. Which is a pretty great thing to be known for. Fight Club should change that again. I would make the comparison that we are seeing in the Fincher / Pitt partnership the same elements that have made Scorsese / DeNiro so timeless. This movie should cement that perception. (And don't get me wrong: Ed Norton is nothing to sneeze at. He was amazing as well.) Anyway if you haven't seen it, my recommendation is: see it. Yes it's violent. Yes it's gritty.

Those who contradict this cannot be as passionate about film as they think they are. Certainly there are other movies in the world, but take it from me, this is the finest piece of film-making you will ever see, it is a true epic. I will reveal nothing more, as I believe a film should be watched afresh, so that it has maximum impact. I would courteousely ask the person who wrote the page long essay on this site to restrict himself in future.

My friends kept telling me on how good of a movie it was. So when it came out on DVD I watched it with my family and fell in love with the movie. Everything about it was amazing (especially Heath Ledger's performance). I named it my favourite movie. Then Inception came out and knowing the expectations of Nolan's work I viewed it in theatres. Once again he blew me away with everything in this film. So when I heard news for The Dark Knight Rises to be set in motion and the fact that this was Nolan's last Batman film I became determined to see it in theatres and tonight I did. My words cannot be expressed on a computer how I feel about this film. The only way I can show my full affection is inside. Yes, I do realize how corny and cheesy it may come off as but it is indeed my true opinion. I cannot write a full review on this film expressing my gratitude for Nolan's work but what I can tell you is this. This movie is nothing short of a MASTERPIECE.

I mean, Raiders of the Lost Ark was an Arachnophobe's nightmare - 3 tarantulas clinging at the back of Indiana Jones was enough, but a hundred on Alfred Molina's character? Jesus Christ, bless his soul. So, being an arachnophobe, that ticked me off already and I had to put off the movie for a good night, or two. However, that wasn't really going to stop me from watching one of the greatest movies ever (as said by Empire in its '301 Greatest Movies Of All Time'). And so, I found my courage once again, skipped the part with the tarantulas, and continued on with the movie. All I can say is: Wow. There's no wonder this movie is one of those movies you just have to watch. It is a complete masterpiece of an 80s classical flick - vintage, kinda'-sorta' cheesy story-wise, a bit of flawed logic here and there, and the protagonist with a beautiful girl at the end. Yes, In the year 2015, we've probably seen it all already and critiquing the themes of this movie in this day and age would not be fair, for sure. But had I been given the chance to watch this movie when it was first released in 1981, I'm pretty sure I would've said to myself: ""Boy, this movie will set the bar for many more adventure movies to come... hopefully"". In terms of the cinematography, the acting, the casting, and the story, I could all give those a 3.5 to a 4 out of 5. Nothing spectacular, but still pretty awesome, nonetheless.  "

15005,tt0167260,adam evans,united kingdom,9,Immensely good conclusion,"Having re-watched this on the sofa just the other day i might have been forgiven for thinking my father would perhaps with nothing else to do, sit down and watch it with me and see if he became hooked. His gripe with the lord of the rings is 'its too much fantasy to the point where you can just make any old nonsense up'. I sort of see his point, since the army of the undead in this film was pushing it as far as what i was willing to accept was concerned. That said its possibly the only thing that tests my patience in this brilliant brilliant film. The pacing was perfect, the narrative flowed back and forth from each character so smoothly in the previous instalment that we sort of took it for granted here and knew what to expect. All the same kudos to Jackson for giving each character enough screen time for us to continue our emotional investment in them. As much as i loved the scenes with Aragon etc, the film is all about frodo and sam to me and i remember in the cinema just being on tender hooks wanting to see how gollums plan would unfold. I think it would have been cool to have a few extra scenes with frodo sam and gollum just showing how gollum is manipulating frodo against sam. Sam asks for the ring but there's no guarantee this would have happened. It would have been cool to see gollum putting sam up to it rather craftily beforehand. The acting is great and some of the playfulness that the previous instalment had going for it (mostly from Gimli) is not lost, despite a darker film all round. The effects as ever from weta are perfect. For anybody who hasn't seen this film, it's obviously part of a trilogy so don't watch it without having seen the other two. I recently watched the Hobbit and i just don't see it anywhere near the quality of these films. I really hate the obviousness of the CGI in it compared with these films and the fact that the plot feels little and not so important. To conclude my father didn't stay and watch the film having got bored, but still it was worth a go.  "
72346,tt0033467,adam evans,united kingdom,10,The Father of Film Noir,"For over 70 years now Citizen Kane has been regarded a cinematic masterpiece. So would it shock you to learn that its immediate reception was largely negative. Of course it would. But not for reasons of legitimate value, since the films content is a mirror image of the media tycoon William Randolph Hearst, who was incensed by the film, it was attacked with pitchforks by newspapers all owned by Hearst. Thankfully years later the film is appreciated for what it is. The finest work of an avant garde filmmaking genius in Welles. Lets start with the element of mise en scene (the techniques employed to combine visual elements e.g lighting, camera movement, setting and camera techniques such as montage to parallel the on screen narrative). Firstly to create the complex and materialistic Kane, Welles puts in a first class performance a seasoned actor would be proud of. Since this was Welles' first feature film, its even more astonishing that his input stemmed top to bottom and worked to such perfection. With all this in mind it's understandable a young up and coming filmmaker would want to be expressive in his work, but its unbelievable that all works to such accord. But as stated, its the cinematic techniques and the little things we ordinarily don't place emphasis or attention to that impress.The use of extreme camera angles is noteworthy in symbolising the sway of power in exchanges; Kane is occasionally framed from extreme angles- low visually making him overpowering and mirroring the on screen events. Aside from this the use of shadow and chiaroscuro lighting parallel the on screen narration, e.g the enigmatic Kane is often filmed in shadow symbolic of the private and emotionally detached Kanes dark persona and the enigma behind 'rosebud'. Setting is another important tool in conveying a story and Citizen Kane not only showcases the perfect settings but its inventive camera-work perfectly complements the environments to maximise their effectiveness. A good example of this is in showing Kane standing at a window when his adoptive father speaks with him. The window appears overpowering next to the minute Kane in the distance, but with just a few steps forward Kane appears overpowering to the camera framing as he speaks of his own vision for building an empire. All appear irrelevant and you may read and think I'm reading too much into these little bouts of symbolism and visual parallelling narrative in aiding the story but one thing is for certain is that these are no accidents and are absolutely deliberate. A little about the story. Charles Foster Kane is dying and his last word uttered is 'rosebud'. Immediately the press attempt to uncover the significance of this and a reporter is sent to interview the nearest and dearest to Kane throughout different periods of his life. The narrative unfolds from the non linear technique of flashbacks and the use of montage is deployed in conveying the jumps in time at different points. One of the most interesting concepts about telling the story in this method is that its more expansive in fleshing out the protagonist Kane; since each storyteller has a different perspective of their own on Kane, each contributes to humanising and dehumanising him accordingly. If I had to place this film into a particular Genre is would categorise it as drama, the transformation of Kane from youthful millionaire with good intentions to selfish materialistic recluse dramatic and extreme. To preach, the film takes a swipe at the rewards and benefits of capitalist America at the time, Kane quoting 'if i hadn't been rich, i might have been a great man'. Profound and innovative it is with money and power undoubtedly being the catalyst for Kanes unpleasant transformation. Supporting performances are all top notch from Everett Sloane, Joseph Cotton etc are the icing on the cake making this film near perfect in truth. I highly recommend giving this film a go, and cannot think of any reason to dislike the film. Even if this isn't your cup of tea, nobody can deny its creative flair, such was the innovation that it spawned a whole new genre in film noir.  "
81512,tt0435761,adam evans,united kingdom,9,Being 20 now....i have to say...this films for my age more!,"When my dad took me and my older brother to see toy story in cinema in 1995, i was only 6 years old and little did i know at the time, i was witnessing the beginning of perhaps the greatest film trilogy of all time. Toy Story captured the imagination and was the perfect family film combining adult (hey ham look i'm picasso....what 6 year old knows picasso) and child-like humour which made it a must see for parents and their children. One of the great things about the toys was how the characters all demonstrate human emotions giving the audience more empathy for them. One things for certain. PIXAR will eventually make a bad film, because its impossible that everything they produce is a masterpiece (although thus far they have done so). This film is their absolute pinnacle. The next film may be excellent, but it can not top this. The film is set around the toys being taken to a daycare centre before Andy's moving on to college. Shortly after arriving it seems the toys have landed on their feet and are set to be more loved and used than ever before. All is not what it seems though and the toys are soon plotting on busting out and getting woody back to Andy before he departs to college. Animation- Outstanding as ever Voice acting- Top class Direction- A joy to behold Everybody on earth has a companion that they feel truly loved by. To Woody, Andy is this and his unwillingness to accept Andy having grown up is saddening to the audience watching. Anyone whose watched toy story 2 will understand Woody is now in Jessie's position shown in the montage. The obvious theme in this movie is growing up and moving on, but having seen the ending, id say woody's choice of jumping in the box with buzz and the rest, signals to people that there are people we love and inevitably have to let go, but your friends will always be there with you. This film had the perfect ending with a healthy message to its viewers. The guys at PIXAR are philosophers on life really aren't they. Up until 3 days ago i had lord of the rings and indiana jones as the pinnacle of film trilogies (not including Indy 4) but i'll have to rethink things now. Outstanding film from pixar but truth be told i was expecting nothing less. 9/10...No more now though....3 is enough  "
96821,tt0363163,adam evans,united kingdom,9,Downfall- The most comprehensive study of Hitlers final days,"Whatever your opinion is of this movie, nobody can deny to create a film with Adolf Hitler the protagonist is a largely transgressive concept. With such a brave approach comes the degree of fictitiousness involved with the films narrative. Since very little is known of the events to occur within Hitlers bunker director Oliver Hirschbiegel has the task of piecing together what little is known with his own vision of Hitlers final days. To start the film offers an array of impressive performances; Bruno Ganz's erratic Hitler perfectly transcends the mere perceptions a perspective audience has when watching the film. He really is awesome. And in honesty he has to be; the basis for the films credibility lay solely on Ganz's performance, but thankfully he delivers to thundering applause. Taboo it may seem humanising somebody whose actions are distinctively 'inhuman', it's still the most accurate portrayal to date; Robert Carlyles overzealous effort, decent but not believable due to farcical overacting. For the supporting cast Traudl Junge, the secretary to Hitler is indeed portrayed inaccurately as a more virtuous, innocent and sweet young girl which sparks criticism from among those educated toward Nazi Germany. However the important motif of innocence is resonant throughout the entire film; children are left to defend Berlin (ignorent to the knowledge they haven't a chance of survival), and the innocents of Germany ultimately are left to face the consequences of the previous generations wrongdoings, while the real perpetrators cop out through suicide and hiding. Though the anti semitism of German society and atrocities perpetrated by the Germans during the war aren't as comprehensively addressed as say Schindler's List its important to address this film for what it is; the story of Hitler and national socialism's final days. Well documented is propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' murder of their children inside Hitler's bunker and this is one of the more uncomfortable scenes of the film, reinforcing the theme of the innocents paying the price. Goebbels and his wife's suicides bear resonance to the status quo sentiment felt by all Germans at this dreadful period; there is no life beyond national socialism. To categorise this film into a genre is a tough task but i'd call it a drama more than anything with action sequences sparsely present. Sounds good on paper right? Well i'll try to place a balanced viewpoint in reviewing this film so lets address the reasons perhaps the film may be limited or perhaps just not for you. 1. To somebody perhaps not a keen enthusiast of History the lengthy scenes and claustrophobic feel of the film (with very few settings) this film may feel a bit of a drag at times. You may however find learning a little is beneficial. 2. To somebody overly educated in Nazi Germany the few historical inaccuracies may just be too much to overlook. 3. As my brother put it upon entering my bedroom and witnessing me watching Downfall, ""Why are you watching that for, its not in English"". An extremely fickle criticism in my eyes but subtitles aren't for everybody. Overall despite this hugely pessimistic outlook on a topic widely controversial, anybody even remotely into films should watch this. Even if you're not a WW2 buff or dislike drama, this film's narrative is largely unrivalled in content, making it by and large a unique film i would recommend to anybody. 8/9-10.  "
69802,tt0119698,Adam Fay,United States,10,One of the greats!," All I have to say is that I waited nearly 3 years from its Japanese release until I finally got to see it. It was well worth the wait. This movie is one of the best I have ever seen, animated OR live action. Everything comes together so well (ie. animation, story, characters, etc.), that it makes for a(for lack of a better word)beautiful movie watching experience. This is definetly Miyazaki at his finest! This puts Disney animation to shame, especially since there are no cheesy singing scenes or other pointless flotsam to get in the way of the story. Buy it, rent it, do whatever is necessary to view this movie! It's a beautiful story that I will definetly enjoy watching again and again!   "
62225,tt1853728,Adam Ferguson,united kingdom,9,"I like the way you direct, Quentin!","This Tarantino monster is full on, vulgar and bloody - and it's excellent. Each of the five star cast contribute five star performances, particularly both Leo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. DiCaprio, who very rarely disappoints in any role, is cast the villainous slave-owner Calvin Candie, a character who DiCaprio himself described as ""the most deplorable human being he'd ever read in a screenplay in his life"" - although he must not have been deplorable enough to turn down... or maybe that was the attraction. Samuel L. Jackson is his senior house slave, Stephen, and puts in a performance like never before. Completely loyal to Candie, Stephen is overly suspicious of all goings-on around him, which brings us on to the lead protagonist Django, played astutely by Jamie Foxx. Django is separated from his wife and longs to reacquaint himself with her. Christophe Waltz portrays the best deceptively calm character i think i've ever seen - much like the one he played in Inglorious Basterds. As Dr. King Schultz he frees Django and takes him under his wing. The dialogue is often poetic, yet does not shy away from crassness (as if Mr. Tarantino would ever comprehend such a thing). Tarantino creates a Western like no other. paced to perfection and with a very catchy soundtrack. I highly recommended this!  "
84354,tt0062622,Adam Fitzgerald,Canada,10,Wonderful and Beautiful.," ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is a film of many things. Extra Terrestrial life, exploration, death, evolution and isolation. The atmosphere is exciting, triumphant and frightening. This is a profoundly touching movie. It is captivating and genius. You must watch this film with an open mind. Otherwise, you may become bored or anxious. Forget about other fast paced movies where the film simply comes out at you, this film makes you become a part of the movie and really think about what is occurring on screen. You will not understand this movie by just 'watching'. Everything in the film has a purpose, do not look over anything.  "
6963,tt0468569,Adam Foidart,canada,10,The definition of a great thriller and of a great superhero film,"The Dark Knight successfully builds on the solid base established by ""Batman Begins"" and continues to explore the complex ideas introduced in the first film. It's filled with several sub plots and events that could individually make a thrilling film (the bank heist at the very beginning for example) and it's not only a great adaptation of a comic book, it's a great thriller. The performances are excellent, the characters are unforgettable, it's got some great action sequences, several iconic and memorable scenes with great quotes and it's also a very intelligent movie. There's more to this than just a battle between Batman and The Joker, so if you think you've seen it all because you saw the old Nicholson/Michael Keaton movie, think again. I think that's my favorite thing about Batman, and about this movie, how there are so many different ways to interpret the characters and so many different layers you can examine on their own, or in addition to the others. You might feel the running time a little, but you won't care because you'll never want to leave your seat. ""The Dark Knight"" is a terrific film, whether you're a fan of the character or not, you won't be disappointed by this complex thriller. (On Blu-ray, August 2, 2012) "
44712,tt0816692,Adam Foidart,canada,10,"Unlike anything you've ever seen; bold, ambitious, mind-blowing","My passion for anything space travel made me fall instantly in love with ""Interstellar"", but there's a lot more to my recommendation of the film than just that. This is a profoundly ambitious movie, one that will make you think and that puts the ""science"" back in ""science fiction"". That's something to be excited about because the genre isn't just about alien robots that can turn into cars and mutant turtles that know martial arts, it's about the endless possibilities that might be within our reach. I'm getting ahead of myself though. You're wondering what this Christopher Nolan project is all about! Well, it's basically about a former NASA pilot named Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) who is enlisted to travel to space in order to find a new home for humanity. Sounds easy right? Not so much when you're venturing into an unknown galaxy through a wormhole, you have to deal with the drama of leaving your family behind for the good of humanity and you might just encounter the odd space anomaly like black holes while dealing with gravity and hypersleep. I have a lot of admiration for this movie. This is one complicated story, and it doesn't try to dumb itself down, ever. It's not so complicated that you can't follow it, but there's a lot of material here. I had heard ahead of time that extensive scientific consultation was provided to make the movie as accurate as possible, but you could easily draw this conclusion yourself just by seeing the film. The visuals here are amazing, like nothing you've ever seen before. Literally. This is as close as we're probably ever going to get to see the inside of a worm hole, a passage from our galaxy to a completely undiscovered universe , fully rendered in a realistic way. That should be enough, but that's just the tip of the iceberg here. We actually get to travel through the worm hole, experiencing the dizzying effects as these astronauts travel who knows how many light years away from home. What do they find on the other side? Strange sights and locations, each more dazzling than the last. The film is absolutely breathtaking when it is showing you what space travel is like. Do you remember how movies used to be about seeing wild locations and catching a glimpse at other cultures across the globe? That's pretty much disappeared now that we have the internet, but that feeling, that rush, is back with ""Interstellar"". It's like the most beautiful Hubble telescope photos you've ever seen, set to a brilliant score by Hans Zimmer (and I know that gets you excited as soon as you remember that thunderous ""Inception"" or ""Dark Knight"" theme), packed with strong performances and what felt to me like boundless imagination. Not only do we have the science fiction elements, with the space travel, the exploration of new worlds and all that this entails, but there's also a lot going on psychologically with this movie. Our main character is leaving Earth and his children behind for a mission that could take who knows how long. Not only does the family have to deal with the idea that they're going to be separated, maybe for years, but it gets even crazier. It's not like Cooper is going to come back to Earth and find that his children have simply grown up. This is space travel here. We've got hibernation sleep for the astronauts to consider, the fact that communication might be very limited and the biggest elephant in the room, the fact that because our astronauts are going to be traveling through space anomalies and at very high speed, the crew is going to be aging at a different rate than the people on Earth. Can you imagine if this mission went wrong and the astronauts got back to Earth, only to find that the world they were trying to save is already dead? Even if it wasn't that far, the odds are good that Cooper will never see his children again. That's not even considering the idea that his children might not WANT to see him again after he leaves the planet to go off exploring the stars. If you want a movie where the stakes are high, this movie is through the roof because it has both the intimate risk of the family crumbling apart and the chance that the entire world will perish. I wish all science fiction, wait; I wish all films were as visionary and as bold as this one. It feels like every single detail was carefully selected and scrutinized to make sure it complimented everything else in the film. Not only do we have sights the likes of which you've never seen before, but I found that the action sequences were also really inventive and even the design of this world had me blown away. The robots in this film, not only in their look, but in their ""personality"" are so awesome that you will never be able to forget them. I feel like there's no shortage of praise I could give this film, and yet there was often so much going on that I'm certain I didn't even notice some significant elements. I know that realistically, there are some dramatic moments that do falter a bit and that the movie might have been able to cut a few minutes here or there, but because of the absolute mind-blowing experience that I had seeing the film, and for the fact that the inspiration and the boldness of it all swept me off my feet, I can't help but give the movie a perfect score. I can't see any way that this isn't going to be on my ""best of the year"" list. I can't wait to watch it again.As for you, see it in Imax if you can. Now that is an experience you won't easily forget. (Theatrical version in Imax, December 4, 2014)  "
55699,tt0209144,Adam Foidart,canada,10,"It's more than a movie, it's an experience.","Memento is brilliant and expertly pieced together. It's more than a movie, it's an experience. How is that possible? Unfortunately it's impossible to describe to you why that is unless you know the premise, so here goes: Our protagonist (Guy Pearce) is a man named Leonard. He is on a seemingly impossible quest for revenge after his wife's rape and murder by an unidentified assailant. The attack left him with a head injury that now prevents him from forming new memories. He knows who he is, he remembers everything up to the moment where he suffered the injury but if he has a conversation that lasts too long, he won't remember how it started. Now, using clues from the night, limited information from the police file that's gone cold, Polaroid photographs, hand-written notes to himself and help from people he has met, Leonard is slowly tracking down the man responsible. Now that you have the premise of the film, there is another vital piece of information that you must know in order to understand what this movie is like. The movie is told in reverse, with the scene that would normally be at the very end of this story being shown at the beginning, and so on. This means that just like the protagonist, you don't know what causes actions or how Leonard go to a spot as its happening. This is where the brilliance of the film comes in. Just like ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", where the drug trip the characters go on, and the experience of watching the movie feel like the same, the condition that Leonard suffers and the experience you will get from watching the movie are the same. It's hard to wrap your brain around this, but even if you're dubious about it working (trust me, it works incredibly well), have you ever seen a movie that tries to pull a trick like this? It's a breath of fresh air. What I love about this movie is that it's not just a gimmicky story; it would still be just as interesting to watch if it was told in the ""normal"" order. It's a story about revenge like no other because it exposes the biggest flaw about going on a quest to get even in a way that no other movie about the subject can. If you were out on the path of vengeance, you might get satisfaction from killing the person that murdered your wife, but that isn't going to get her back. The purpose of revenge then, is revenge itself. You seek retribution in order to give yourself the satisfaction that you have done something. But what happens when you don't even have that? What happens when you find the guy and you take gleeful pleasure in making him suffer so intensely that he prays for death, but once the deed is done you can't even remember it happening? I'm a huge fan of films about payback because there's something primal about them that is satisfying, but they also lend themselves very well to complicated ideas and paradoxes. This is one of the smartest and most original stories of revenge that I've seen. There's even more going on with this movie because it plays wonderfully with the condition that Leonard suffers from (the technical term is anterograde amnesia). As the story unfolds you see that many people sympathize with the man's condition, while others use it to their advantage and ultimately it becomes impossible to know who he can really trust. The further you get into the movie, the more twisted it gets and everything that you think you know gets turned upside down. Once again, it makes you as disoriented as the character in the movie and that's a wonderful, original and confusing feeling. All of a sudden, sequences of mundane exposition become huge plot twists! I found ""Memento"" to be an extremely satisfying experience. It's so twisty, so intelligently written, so well acted and so well directed that it's the kind of movie that you can never forget once you've seen. I absolutely loved it and I'm very curious to see how it plays out a second time around, or if there is a way to view it in the ""correct"" order with some special edition blu-ray or DVD out there. I can't say enough good things about it. If you're interested in movies even a little bit, you should treat yourself by experiencing ""Memento"". (On Blu-ray, June 14, 2012)  "
60710,tt0043014,Adam Foidart,canada,9,"It threw me off at first, but I still really liked it, and I'd like to see it again.","Sunset Blvd. is a classy film noir that threw me for a loop at first. It features excellent performances and is paced well, building up the tension as we see the madness of the strange Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) unfold. Swanson's performance at first seems very silly and over the top, until you realize that due to her silent film career, her speech patterns have become as broad as the expressions she used to convey emotions in her films. She's become this kind of otherworldly figure that doesn't fit in with normal people at all. I guess you could argue that she's the villain of the film and appropriately steals the show, but I also really like the more... sympathetic characters. William Holden and Nancy Olson have great chemistry and it's refreshing to see them on the screen together while the rest of the movie keeps showing off this weird relationship that develops between Holden and Swanson. If you don't know what the film is about, at first you may find it a little slow. As the story develops you will get sucked in and you won't even mind the fact that the story is told in flashback because you will either forget all about it or really want to know how the story you're seeing ends up the way it does.

93248,tt0372784,Adam Foidart,canada,10,It makes a Batman fan out of all of us.,"Batman Begins is not only an expertly crafted superhero movie, it's flat-out a great action film. Every element of the film is top notch. We're given a solid cast of professional actors who take the material seriously, which means we get characters that are iconic and memorable and would be even if they weren't based on the immortal characters of DC Comics. What I still find surprising is that even though any Batman fan, and most people that are somewhat familiar with the character will know roughly what his origins are, but the story does not feel repetitive at all. It feels fresh, and it's very tightly written. As an extra bonus, there is plenty of exciting action sequences. The movie is filled with memorable moments, some great lines and the score is a real powerhouse. There's at least two great car chases during the film that are both really thrilling and the movie gets very inventive with some of the gadgets used by Batman. If you have a friend that has been turned off of the superhero films or never took comic books seriously, this is the movie you want to show them. Not only will they be easily converted but it will give you a chance to watch this movie again. If you haven't re-visited this chapter in the trilogy since the original release date, you've likely forgotten how good this movie actually is (which is likely due to the success of the later films) but on its own or as part of the franchise, it's a landmark in the comic book adaptation genre.

As the crime is set up, I had a lot of fun seeing how (or if) the plan by the villain could/would go wrong and it's gripping to see all the events play through. I enjoyed it quite a bit, particularly the ending, but I do have one gripe with it. The film is shot like a play so there is a distinct lack of visual style, which is disappointing. I have heard that this movie is also sometimes shown in 3-D, maybe that somehow hindered the look of the film, or maybe it's the fact that I saw it in 2-D that made it seem like there was something missing. I don't know for sure, but that's my theory. Otherwise, the movie plays out just fine and it's a lot of fun to watch, particularly towards that conclusion where all of the clues and everything start falling into place.

124939,tt2267998,Adam Foidart,canada,10,One of my favorite movies of 2014,"Gone Girl is the most exciting thriller I've seen in a long time. I'll be shocked if it doesn't end up my 2014 ""Top 10"" list. Before you go see this one, you better apply ample amounts of deodorant because it is the kind of movie that will shake you and make you sweat, a lot. It begins on a strange evening. Nick (Ben Affleck) and his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) are celebrating their 5th wedding anniversary, but when Nick gets home, his wife is not there. The front door is open and there are signs of a struggle inside. In the ensuing media frenzy, the public fall in love with Amy and everyone frantically searches for her. With all eyes turned towards him Nick begins acting suspiciously, or at least not the way that the media thinks he should be acting. The media turns on him in an ever increasingly torturous descent filled with devastating revelations. ""Gone Girl"" is filled with so many twists and turns that I'm not going to be able to tell you much about the plot, but I can tell you what my viewing experience was like. Imagine that you are walking down a dark alley in a seedy part of town. You see someone hurriedly running through. Out of their pocket a ticket falls out. You pick it up and on it reads ""The most dazzling show on earth! Unforgettable! It will shake you to your core!"" You notice the price on the ticket reads $100 and that the show is nearby. You yell out to the stranger, but they are already long gone, so go take a look. Inside is a massive amphitheater, but only a few people are attending. None are in the front row and everyone seems to be keeping to themselves. You sit down and notice that the stage is set up like a magic show. A nervous-looking man enters, fitted with a straight jacket and led by a beautiful femme-fatale-looking assistant. He is thrown head-first through three rings of fire and into a glass coffin. The coffin is slowly being filled with acid while walls adorned with spikes begin closing in. You're awfully excited to see how this guy is going to get out of it when you hear a blood-curdling scream in the row behind you. Someone has fainted. You ask yourself why a show this grandiose and elaborate isn't being attended by more people. Then it dawns on you that maybe there's a reason that guy in the alley was running so quickly. Maybe the gentleman who has been thrown into a seemingly escape-proof solution isn't meant to escape at all... That's what this movie is like. It's a nightmare that scares you but is addictive so you can't turn away. You see our main character getting into a situation that just keeps getting worse and worse. Sometimes it's his own fault, sometimes it isn't. It would be a dreadful, depressing experience if it wasn't for two things. The first is that there is a way out of this, or at least in theory there is. You don't quite understand what happened here, but you know that it's only a matter of time before this whole thing blows over and our hero sets the record straight... right? The second is the mystery. What did happen? Where did Amy go? What part did Nick have in her disappearance, if any? Who is responsible, and why? As the film plays out, you will be treated to one devastating and head-spinning revelation after another. Every time you think you have something figured out, a new wrench is thrown in the mechanism and it begins to crumble all over again. To give it a whole new level of intensity, the film is incredibly realistic and air-tight in its developments. The characters feel genuine and have real depth to them. The moments of incredible tension are often broken by moments of nervous laughter as the characters involved try to steel themselves against this nightmare they have found themselves in. The script and the story are razor-sharp in their wit and intelligence (Gillian Flynn, the author of the novel did an incredible job). As an added bonus, the performances are super intense. I have unfortunately come to associate Tyler Perry with wooden performances, unless he's in a dress, but he is very good in this film. Everyone is really good in this film in fact. You will see the cast list at the beginning of the movie and you will barely be able to recognize some of the actors because the roles and performances they are showing off here are unlike anything you've seen before. I also really admire the score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, who did a terrific job in David Fincher's ""Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" and once again amplify the eerie and tense atmosphere of the film without distracting you from the action or resorting to cheap musical cues. This film lasts over two hours and it left me wanting more. I didn't see the time fly by at all because it is never slow. In fact, it only gets more intense as the minutes tick by. And that ending... absolutely perfect. I was all sweaty, nervous and fearful when I left the theater, even though I had a friend to reassure me that everything was going to be perfectly safe. I don't know what else I can tell you about this film. I give it my highest recommendation. There is a reason why every time I went to check this one out at the theater, it was full to the brim. This time, I decided to bite the bullet and grab some crappy seats near the front just so I could finally see it. It was worth it. ""Gone Girl"" is so intense that I absolutely have to watch it again, and soon. (Theatrical version on the big screen, October 18, 2014)  "
143345,tt0198781,Adam Foidart,canada,10,Wonderful animated film for adults and children,"Monsters Inc. isn't only a film that will delight kids; it's got big laughs for adults too. What I love about this movie most of all is the truly original premise. This world where monsters are real and they power up their cities by bottling up the screams of frightened children is wonderfully inventive and it lends itself to some incredibly creative character designs. It's all so well animated that you might just forget that what you're seeing on the screen isn't live action footage (particularly the scenes involving snow). Another particularly strong element in my opinion is the voice casting. The voices match the monsters so well that the models must have been modified or done after the recordings were done to match the voices, mannerisms and dialogue so well. Either that or we've got some incredibly dedicated, intelligent and talented individuals with an incredible amount of forethought behind the scenes at Pixar. It's sweet and funny, with just that right sprinkle of heart and at times very thrilling too. One chase scene involving doors (you know what I mean if you've seen the movie) in particular always gets me excited and I never get tired of gushing over how wonderfully original it is. It's filled with characters and moments with Mike (Billy Crystal), Sully (John Goodman) and Boo (Mary Gibbs) that your heart would have to be made of stone not to enjoy it. Every time I watch this movie I catch some new gag in the background or some new detail I've overlooked in the past, meaning it's got great re-watch value as well. You'll always find something interesting to look at (though you'll have to be familiar with the story to be able to pull your eyes away from the main action). This is the kind of movie that you call a ""family"" film because anyone can watch ""Monsters, Inc."" and instantly fall in love with it. When you watch it with other people, it makes you feel like your enjoyment of the movie is bringing you all closer together. It's so great and smart and funny that you'll have a terrific time watching it over and over. (On DVD, October 27, 2012)  "
147824,tt0401792,Adam Foidart,canada,9,Visually striking and memorable. Dark fun.,"Sin City is gritty, dirty, sleazy and violent. It's an excellent adaptation of the graphic novels by Frank Miller and even if you haven't read the original material, it's a lot of fun. This anthology film features characters that are memorable and likable (or despicable) so it will grab your attention and hold on tight the whole way. There are a lot of memorable scenes and lines that are sure to stick with you too but the best part of the film is the art direction and visual style. An element I'm glad they kept from the original source is that the stories are told almost entirely in black and white, with sharp contrast accentuated in many scenes to not only make certain actions more visually striking, but also to make it easy to follow. Then, the movie does something unique. There are dashes of color in certain scenes to make certain actions and characters even more striking. There's a certain character that is highlighted with the color yellow. His physical appearance already makes him stand out, but that use of color makes him feel extra creepy and it's very effective. The sets and character designs (because some characters here are fitted with heavy makeup and prosthetics to make them stand out and look even more unique) make every frame look like a comic book panel, Every shot I saw looked like it had been meticulously planned out, like a piece of art you could have framed on your wall. The bold style isn't just a gimmick though. It's all blended in seamlessly with the story and helps to reinforce the grittyness and themes of corruption while helping accentuate the prevalent violence of the film. My only real criticism is that some of the performances aren't great (Bruce Willis plays it too low-key). It's a disappointment considering some of the others are quite good, and not in the ways you would expect either. I had to do a double take when I realized that was Elijah Wood and Mickey Rourke I just saw! It's a bit of a mixed bag in that department, but everything else is top notch. Once you see ""Sin City"" you'll be hard pressed to forget it, and not only because of the visuals. (Extended cut on Blu-ray, August 25, 2012)  "
151154,tt0325980,Adam Foidart,canada,9,It's got a bit of everything for everyone.,"Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is a grand action film loaded with memorable characters, swashbuckling and great special effects. It's sure to please audiences and leave them roaring for more pirate adventures (which have been provided in the form of 3 sequels as of 2012). Despite a few shortcomings (the curse itself for example, is not well explained) it's just a lot of fun to sit through and it's good for the whole family (assuming the children won't be too frightened by the cursed pirates and can handle the action and violence). It's got everything you could want in a story: romance, action, humour, friendship, chases, even a bit of horror thrown in too. (On Blu-ray, August 11, 2012)  "
153118,tt2084970,Adam Foidart,canada,9,Emotional and tense. Historical accuracy be damned; this movie works.,"All I really knew going into ""The Imitation Game"" was that the poster made it look good, that Benedict Cumberbatch was playing the lead and that the movie was about Alan Turing, which many people consider the father of the modern computer. When I left, I was pleased with my experience not only because I ""learned things"" (I always take ""based on a true story"" with a grain of salt), but mostly I was pleased because it's a movie that got me thinking. I like turning my brain off to a dumb action movie as much as the next guy, but when a movie gets you to re-examine the world around you, that's something special. The film shows us Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) and his team of code-breakers' efforts to crack the Enigma Machine, an encoding device used by the Nazis during World War II. Turing is convinced that the previous efforts, all done by hand were more than fruitless, they were foolish. The only chance they have of cracking the codes and winning the war is to create a machine, one the likes of no one (at least no one in the 40's) has ever seen. The film follows the team's efforts as well as Turing's life before, and after the war. This movie had me thinking a lot about the geniuses we've seen throughout history. Alan Turing (at least as portrayed in this movie) is a strange man, one that does not fit in particularly well with the rest of society at his time. He doesn't react to humour well, he is easily dismissive of others if they are doing things he doesn't agree with and he's not just dedicated to his work, he's obsessed with it. People don't like him instinctively because he's weird and that's a big hurdle he has to overcome because his code-breaking machine is a very expensive piece of equipment made to be in the service of military men, who are not particularly well known for their acceptance of wild ideas. I wondered, as the film progressed, how many geniuses throughout history were similarly ostracized or misunderstood. To make something new, something that no one else has ever thought of, you have to be a little bit off your mark, because you're thinking in a different way than everybody else is, right? Many visionaries must have felt profoundly lonely in their days because of the way society reacted to their eccentricities. What I really liked about the movie is that it put me right there, in Alan Turing's shoes as he struggled day in and day out to get his machine to work, desperately trying to make it to decipher code faster, to show to others that the machine he is putting together is not a waste of time and money. I'm not particularly computer literate, but even I could see that the machine he was working on was a dynamite idea. Every time someone came in and threatened to tear it apart, every time the machine failed to perform as it was supposed to, I was on the edge of my seat. I saw something that very few people in the movie could, that this guy was a genius and that you're not necessarily going to understand what someone that thinks outside the box is doing, but if you just give them time and space, you will get results. Another aspect of the movie that I really enjoyed comes later in the movie, in Turing's life after the war. Without revealing what happens, it's one of those scenarios where you look back at people who were doing what was considered socially acceptable at the time, and you hate them. I understand that some of the behaviour at the time wasn't ""wrong"" by their standards, but I still found myself outraged and the words ""barbarians"" came to mind more than once. It got me wondering how our customs of today will be looked at in the future. Just as the generals and peers of Alan Turing dismissed him as a fool or a degenerate and we now look back and them with anger, will we be looked at by future generations as savages? The portion of the movie that dealt with the building of Turing's machine had me excited to see what would happen next. The segments that dealt with his life before and after WWII had my heart wrenching. I found myself becoming very emotional and I will admit that I cried a little bit at the end of the movie. I wrote so much about what the movie meant to me emotionally that I almost didn't leave any room to talk about the technical aspects. Firstly, there are some dynamite performances here. Benedict Cumberbatch shines as he usually does, but I also thought that some of the secondary characters were very good. I hope that when people talk about what was good in this movie, they don't forget to mention Keira Knightley (who plays an underdog, just like Turing and had me equally captivated) and Mark Strong as Maj. Gen Stewart Menzies who brings in some harsh truths about war that devastated me. I can't think of anyone that was bad, so you'll have to forgive me if I don't list everyone here. I thought the ending of the film was particularly powerful, that the movie as a whole was very exciting (even if I kind of knew where the Enigma machine thing was going) and it actually had me thinking a lot about war as a whole, about how it affects people in the service of the army in so many different ways, and seldom in a positive fashion. I really think ""The Imitation Game"" is a movie you should seek out. It's powerful, it isn't just a neat little story about the first steps towards modern-day computers, it's a lot more important than that. (Theatrical version on the big screen, January 1, 2015)  "
65480,tt1345836,Adam Foidart,canada,10,"Doesn't quite live up as a sequel to ""The Dark Knight"" but by no means a sub-par film","The Dark Knight Rises It's not so much a story about The Batman, as much as a story about Gotham City and the people affected by Bruce Wayne's alter ego. It's a culmination of every action taken by The Batman coming down in the form of some menacing villains. It's the most anticipated movie of 2012 and because the bar has been raised so ridiculously high, it doesn't quite live up to the expectations. That doesn't mean that is a bad movie. DKR has excellent performances, a tense story that will keep you on the edge of your seat, cool additions to the Batman mythology and a compelling villain. The climax is one intense experience and what Tom Hardy does with just his eyes and his voice is unbelievable. He is a truly frightening foe for The Batman. Some of the criticisms I have concern the pacing of the film. I felt like at times it runs slightly too long and some of the slow beginning should have been cut a bit. Once the momentum gets going you won't want to miss a single second. It's a satisfying conclusion to the Christopher Nolan trilogy and aside from a few minor things it's pretty much the perfect third film in one of the best trilogies out there.

80506,tt0056172,Adam Foidart,canada,10,"If you haven't seen it, you're missing out","Lawrence of Arabia is a grandiose film that's a must watch; even if you're not a huge movie buff, it resonates with so much scale and spectacle that you will be blown away. This epic adventure drama is based on the life of T.E. Lawrence, played here y Peter O'Toole. The bulk of the story centers around Lawrence's experiences in the Middle East during World War I, particularly some of the large battles he took place In and his Involvement in the Arab National Council. There's more than just action here though, Lawrence is a deeply conflicted man who struggles with some internal turmoil as well as the inevitable violence that arises during war times. Don't settle for watching it on your rink-dink phone or even your TV, take the time to seek it out and find a theatre near you that's showing it on a giant screen because this movie features such breathtaking sights that you will be missing out otherwise. Oh, you'll still be able to appreciate the scale and cinematography elsewhere, but it won't be the same. Regardless of where you see it, the excellent performances and epic storyline will have you cheering. What struck me in particular Is the cinematography. Several shots show armies rushing through enormous landscapes high above, and In one particularly memorable scene a tiny dot on the horizon reveals itself to be a lone rider, coming towards the camera. Writing it down just doesn't do it justice. Consistently, I found myself scratching my head wondering ""how did they do that?"" All of these enormous crowd shots or scenes featuring raids on trains featuring clockwork-like coordination make me wonder. It looks like the film was either done in one take or the sand was painstakingly cleaned to look like it was undisturbed between re-shoots. There were no computers in 1962 and yet this looks as Impressive as the $150 million CGI fests that we get every summer. As Lawrence, Peter O'Toole's performance is amazing. He really portrays the feelings of someone who is tortured and divided inside, but almost isn't allowed to worry about it because of the huge burden on his shoulders. The story, despite its multiple characters and multiple locations (several of which have foreign, difficult to pronounce names that you will probably have trouble remembering) is clear and easy to follow. If there's any fault it's that at times the film is overwhelming. So much goes on and there's so much that happens beneath the surface of our hero's exterior that you will have to watch it multiple times to get a real handle on all of it. There is so much greatness here it's hard to describe it all. It's a landmark in filmmaking and you've probably seen countless parodies and clips of the film over the years, so for that reason alone it's worth a watch. It's a long show, but you won't mind thanks to the intermission and it will really stick with you. It's more than worth your time. I feel guilty admitting this but I almost had a bit of pre-conceived negative feelings towards it because I'd heard people almost trying to guilt me into watching it because they called it ""The greatest movie of all time"". Now the only person I feel resentment towards is me for not checking it out sooner. Even if you don't absolutely fall in love with it, there's no doubt you will be very impressed.

It's beautifully shot, the songs are memorable and the dance choreography is fantastic. Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds have perfect chemistry together and are all terrific physical and comedic performers. It's really amazing to see them singing and dancing together and because the film maker knew how talented these people were, the editing during these scenes is sparse, allowing you to really admire everything with few cuts. I had seen the titular segment where Gene Kelly is ""singin' in the rain"" and still it contained so much joy that it felt fresh to me. That's an iconic moment that makes the movie worth seeing all by itself there are many other great segments, like the ""Make 'em Laugh"" sequence, where Donald O'Connor does an impromptu number, all on his own without a stunt double and ""Good Morning"" where we get to see the three leads together celebrating a breakthrough. You really get to see that these people were amazing physical performers and it makes you want to get up and practice their moves in the hopes that you could be as good. There's so much energy in the film that it's a real delight to see. It's sure to please you and make you smile, it's laugh-out-loud funny and I also enjoyed seeing the lighthearted insight on the world of filmmaking as the talkies started replacing the silent films.

11726,tt0110912,Adam G,canada,1,"A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.","There are many differing schools of thought regarding Quentin Tarantino and his so-called ""style"". There are those who believe that the director who began his career as a humble video store clerk with a voracious appetite for movies of every conceivable style is talented and worth imitating. While Tarantino has made some movies worth discussing for their positive qualities (Reservoir Dogs is, by far, his best effort), this group of movies is rather small, especially considering that he has only directed five movies. There is another school of thought who regards his works as inane, self-indulgent, and bloated. Pulp Fiction, written and directed by Tarantino, and released in 1994, is his most divisive movie simply by virtue of being his most well-known. Upon its release, it was hailed as a warning shot to a complacent Hollywood- the maverick behind the indie hit Reservoir Dogs apparently had something else up his sleeve. Pulp Fiction is ostensibly a crime story featuring the interconnecting lives of several characters. However, upon repeat viewings, the viewer begins to wonder exactly what that something is. Personally, I found this movie ran too long in spots, likely because Tarantino is so ridiculously in love with the sound of his own voice as spoken by different actors that he is afraid to cut one speech or even a single line. Dialogue, though it doesn't necessarily need to serve the story to justify its inclusion, should not be so dense as to drive the viewer out of the experience. When John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, on the way to retrieving a briefcase for their employer, are talking about European hamburgers and foot massages, the scene plays like a witty outtake- as though the actors so understood the style of the movie that they were in that they felt comfortable riffing with the material. Not so- the rest of the movie is filled with conversations of a similar type, including (but not limited to) body piercing, blueberry pancakes, hamburgers (again), and coffee (this one performed by Quentin Tarantino himself, as though he couldn't wait to get a shot at delivering his own lines). The strangest thing is, while the characters are ""in character"", as Samuel L. Jackson says in an opening scene, the movie is quite enjoyable. When the characters are placed into real confrontations, the movie takes on an entirely different persona and becomes at least a decent crime movie. Ultimately, however, these scenes are few and far between and, unfortunately, the movie clocks in at 154 minutes. There's really only a decent short film in all of this. The movie also lacks what I would call a plot. The movie is described as three stories about one story, though that one story (ending, chronologically, with Bruce Willis and his irritating Euro girlfriend riding off into the sunset) doesn't connect the characters enough to be truly about one thing. Ultimately the movie is a prime example of what happens when a VCR and a wide selection of movies replace film school. The movie lacks a coherent center and seems more like something that was made for the sake of just committing something to film and resurrecting the flagging career of John Travolta. The movie is too large in scope to sustain itself, and, in the end, implodes because there is really no conviction behind the presentation- too concerned with being a hipster-cool riff on a crime story, rife with pop in-jokes and 70's music (perhaps the best part of the movie is the soundtrack), somebody must have neglected to mention that the movie went nowhere and lacked the momentum to even get there. While all of these qualities combine to form a truly deplorable viewing experience, I do have to mention Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson as two performers in this movie who, I felt, got away clean. Bruce Willis probably gets away with it because he's alone for the majority of his segment and, therefore, doesn't have anybody with whom to trade despicably derisible dialogue. Samuel L. Jackson gets a mention because of the scene at the very end of the movie in which he confronts Tim Roth's character and makes him realize that there are far more fearsome powers at work in the world than robbing a diner. In fact, the scenes coming directly at the beginning and the end of the movie are the two best, and everything else is filler. As you no doubt have guessed, I fall squarely in the latter of the two groups I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Pulp Fiction is inane, self-indulgent, and bloated.  "

It's stuff like Urban Legends and Scream where the killer is the last person you'd suspect because the reason behind it is retarded and mostly based on information that you don't have. Worse than that is stuff like Clue where there are a bunch of possible different endings to the movie that all work so that there's really no way to predict the ending. This movie was even more idiotic than those because not only is there no certain way to come to the logical conclusion given the clues but the whole story we're presented with is a string of lies. Oh wow shocker! Well of course it's a shocker! It's like you hear the story of little red riding hood and then at the end your grandmother who's telling it to you says ""You know what?

Stanley Kubrick's unique style is on full display in this thriller that can be very graphic at times. Some scenes are twisted, some are gut wrenching, and some are outrageous. While the film is certainly not for everyone, it is fantastically different than most films ever made. Kubrick is not afraid to push the limits and refuses to follow the guidelines laid out by most movies. The uniqueness alone makes ""A Clockwork Orange"" worth watching. The star of this film is Alex DeLarge. He is a homicidal rapist and killer who assumes the role of a regular, every day student during the day. Alex and his friends deceive innocent people in order to gain access to their home. Once inside, they torture and kill the unsuspecting victims. Their scheme works on most occasions. One night however, a woman refuses to let them in. She calls the cops instead. Alex, having none of that, breaks in to her house while his friends wait outside. He murders the lady in a very graphic manner. While inside, he hears the sirens of the police on the way. In a panic, Alex quickly runs outside and meets his friends. What Alex is not counting on is that his friends turn on him. They bash him over the head and flee so that Alex is arrested and they get away easy. Alex becomes the ideal inmate while in prison. He is friendly with guards, plays by the rules, and even takes to reading the bible. As part of being the stand-up citizen in prison, he agrees to be part of an experimental type of treatment. A therapy of sorts, accomplished through a group of rehabilitation sessions. The goal of these sessions is to cure him of the violence that remains inside his mind. The curing sessions turn out to be incredibly violent. They are some of the more gruesome scenes most will ever see. One of the more unique pieces of ""A Clockwork Orange"" is the soundtrack featured during some of the violent scenes. The music is almost whimsical, certainly not fitting with what most would associate with the actions taking place. Malcolm McDowell does an excellent job portraying Alex Delarge in this film. What I liked most is the realism in his character. Despite everything he went through, in the end, Alex remains just as evil as he always was. There aren't always happy endings or feel good stories in real life. Sometimes people are sick. While normally very likable as an actor, McDowell does a great job of keeping his character dislikable in this role. He really shows few redeemable qualities. Kubrick also deserves a great deal of credit for directing McDowell in this role. It is fairly easy to follow Hollywood's tried and true path of stories that send the audience home happy. It is quite difficult to be different and to risk your career as a director to put something out there that does not fit the norm.   "

I had heard all the hype about this movie which didn't intrigue me from the previews and eventually became intrigued nonetheless. As I watched it I realized that this is, at least, the fifth modern film to use apparitions or schizophrenia to create a surprise. ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Fight Club"", ""The Others"" and ""Vanilla Sky"". All have been made in recent years, all use the same devices, and all used them much better than ""A Beautiful Mind"". I'm getting tired of it as it nears creating it's own genre of ""Suprise"" filmmaking. Ron Howard does an excellent job directing as usual and the acting was good, as expected... not wonderful or perfect. I suggest you see ""Rain Man"", ""Sling Blade"" or ""Regarding Henry"" if you fancy a brilliant actor playing the role of a handicap. The thing I didn't enjoy was that this movie never really decided what kind of film it wanted to be. You begin to attach yourself to Nash and then suddenly his wife takes over as the object of the movie.. and she shouldn't be. It's like Nash wants it to be an ""October Sky"" about discovery and merit and then this wife wants it to be a bad romance novel about love. I adore a good love story, don't get me wrong, but this movie wasn't a love story, nor was it about overcoming one's odds.. it was a horrible incomplete attempt at homogenizing these things.

145414,tt1392214,Adam K,united kingdom,9,Best Movie of 2013?,"I watched this film with very low expectations: the trailer looked good enough but i was questioning whether it was worth spending over two hours of my time on, and i am so glad i did watch it in the end. The synopsis of this movie is in full in the trailer, but if you are still unsure from the trailer and reading other reviews, the main story is basically the investigation of the disappearance of two young girls from two different, but very close, families. This film is exactly what i have been looking for and i didn't even know it. This film has everything, it has tension and suspense, but also has action and is full of emotion. What makes this film so good is that i have never seen anything like it. It wasn't predictable at all, but it also wasn't so unpredictable that story line just became hard to follow and unrealistic. This film could have easily been based on a true story, which is why it was so engaging. The acting in this film was phenomenal, especially Hugh Jackman's performance, to the point where at times i forgot that this was just a film. Jake Gyllenhaal who adopted the role of the head detective was also fantastic, as was Paul Dano who portrayed the main suspect. There were only (roughly) 8 main characters; the four parents, the two children who disappeared, the detective, and the main suspect (Alex Jones) but not at any point did I feel there was a lack of detail and continuity. In fact, my only criticism would be that we barely saw the two mothers in the film in comparison to some other characters, but thats just me being picky. I would highly recommend this movie to anybody i know, unless you are not a fan of violence/gore/blood etc as it is fairly prominent throughout. This film is definitely worse watching, and as it is out on DVD tomorrow, i suggest you snatch a copy if you get the chance.  "
122566,tt0758758,Adam Kane,canada,7,"Very Good Film, I'm Glad I Finally Watched It!","I've been long procrastinating to watch Into The Wild as I work at BlockBuster video and everyday people ask for this movie. I work in the second smallest store in Western Canada and we only have 30 copies of this movie for customers. Now after watching the film I wish we had a lot more. This is a very nicely shot movie with beautiful scenic shots. I am not a big Sean Penn fan but I thought he played a good role. Vince Vaughn is also in this for a short time and was also was very good as I enjoy his acting. Being a musician myself and a huge fan of Pearl Jam I loved the Eddie Vedder acoustic tracks in the movie. Great music selection in this film with other folk driven music as well. Very sad story which apparently is true. I just thought the narration was a little cheese but at the end when it says that the sister took care of his remains that struck a chord with me. I also loved how this film had a total hippie vibe to it. I loved Rainy and Jan and the nudist hippie's at the end are funny when the old guy is like ""How can you live beside those dope smokin' hippie's"" and Sean Penn says ""Well, they just keep to themselves"". Very Good Film. I'm glad I finally watched it.  "

A lot darker, more depraved, more desperate, everything that made the movie great is amplified in the book with a different ending that is superior to the Hollywood ending of the film.

112118,tt0077416,Adam Kennedy,united states,2,I wish I was playing Russian Roulette," I have seen and enjoyed many long movies before, but dear God this was absolute trash. We have three blue collar friends who up and join the Army to fight in Vietnam, they get sent to different units and coincidentally end up on the same battlefield. That probably took no more then 30 minutes but I would swear it seems like 90. Robert DeNiro doesn't recognize his friends at first, somehow he just has lost it, never an explanation. They get captured, play russian roulette, escape, Christopher Walken gets left behind, blah, blah, blah. I think the movie clocks in at around 2.5-3 hrs. but I swear it feels not like hours but more like days. An absolutely putrid movie not worth the cellanoid it is printed on.  "
120475,tt0084787,Adam King,united states,10,A classic,Horror movies today or not like the horror movies 20 years ago. I think a good horror movie isn't just about people getting slashed to bits and pieces or seeing a character die by getting his head chopped off and so on.This movie has a lots of gore and blood and violence but for a good reason.The Thing actually has a story not just people getting killed every 20 minutes. The thing may be one of the bloodiest movies i have seen but i think its one of the best horror movies.What i like about it is when The Thing gets on people you have to think who it is.I think The Thing isn't just a horror movie its also makes you think.If you like really good horror movies you need to see this!

At the end of the movie i thought that was the end of Jason Bourne, but i was wrong he lives! Now there's only one more question in my head is if they will make a Bourne 4. All the Bourne fans need to see the third! I recommend if you haven't seen the first two Bourne movies then watch those before you see the third. The best Bourne movie (so far)  "
82824,tt0338013,Adam Lebech (adam.lebech@gmail.com),Denmark,10,Most beautiful movie ever made,"Eternal sunshine on the spotless mind is the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. What is it that makes it so unique? The most important thing is that the dialog is so utterly realistic and believable that you cannot help getting the movie under your skin. Just consider one of the dialogs that gave me goose pimples. This dialog takes place when they both realize the memory will soon be gone: Clementine: This is it, Joel. It's going to be gone soon. Joel: I know. Clementine: What do we do? Joel: Enjoy it. Or just consider this dialog that took place after Joel had abandoned Clem in one of their first memories together: Clementine: I wish you had stayed. Joel: I wish I had stayed to. I swear to god I wish I had stayed. I wish I had done a lot of things. I wish... I wish I had stayed. Clementine: Joel? What if you stayed this time? I have truly never experienced a movie that came this close to portraying real life. The feelings were so utterly realistic that I could not help crying. What a truly magical and beautiful movie. It makes me think of one of my favorite songs of all time, ""At my most beautiful"" by R.E.M. What makes this song so fantastic. It's the believability that we can all relate to: I read bad poetry into your machine // I save your messages just to hear your voice // you always listen carefully to awkward rhymes // you always say your name // like I wouldn't know it's you // at your most beautiful."" The most beautiful art is the one that touches you deep in the heart because it catches the most important aspects of the human condition. Eternal sunshine is one of those films. In fact, when I compare the film to the 500 other films on my ratings list, they do not reach it. It is simply the best movie of all time.  "

He overcomes this irreversible infirmity by doing intense physical exercise while starving to death with a broken back... not the only ridiculous plot failing, just the major one for me. There was so much unnecessary character back story eating away screen time, and mostly for disposable characters not important to the current plot whatsoever. Since, with Batman incapacitated the majority of the film, a lot of the story focused on the Robin character. It might as well have ended with a ""to be continued"" slap in the face like Matrix Reloaded  "
12540,tt0110912,Adam Marsden,united kingdom,10,All Time Modern Classic - A Disjointed Review,"Tarantino never fails to impress with this all time modern classic, the film follows the lives of some very interesting character's, opening with the ""Bonny and Clyde"" duo Pumpkin and Honey Bunny. The film has nothing but everything to do with the duo as the film opens and closes with the two in toe, some of the most rememberable one liners of the films contain the duo as they nock off an ordinary LA diner. As the film progresses we are introduced to two new characters, Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield ( Samuel L Jackson) both hired guns en route to a hit. Vincent seems ever the realist, slow talking cool and confident, Jules the poetic, religious man dog. The speeches between the two characters throughout the film are both realistic, yet pointless pillow talk, that gives the film a somewhat believable quality no matter how far fetched some of the stories may be, Tarantino has the nack of making them sound true by adding this banter between scenes, almost acting as an air break or rest stop from the action and violence. Later on we meet Mia Wallace (Uma Thurman) the wife of Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) The kingpin of the Tarantino underworld. Uma is cool, sexy and always something has to say. Her mysterious entrance is made when Vincent Vega is asked by Marsellu, if he would take care of her for the night while he is out of town. This in it's self is another story and another adventure in the film, Vincent takes her out for lunch at the well known but not so famous, Jack Rabbit Slims this scene again is one of the most iconic and talked about moments from the film. Here we also also exposed to Tarantino's rockabilly music taste which encompasses the film so well. Bruce Willis makes his way onto the screen in Pulp Fiction as a one hit KO boxer,Butch Coolidge. his story begins with the ""Gold Watch"" story, this gold watch symbolises Butch''s drive through life, as we learn that the watch has survived through many war's struggles and pains, if a simple gold watch can make it this far, so can butch. His drive through the film is to escape an accidental murder, the result of a boxing match, however many pitfalls await him and his girlfriend Fabienne (Maria de Medeiros) Just a light intro to the film and it's colourful characters within, but all in all a timeless classic and a must see for any film buff, or anyone that watches films in this case, I struggle to find anyone that doesn't have at least one good thing to say about this film, as it contains all the qualities of a masterpiece to be talked about time and time again! Hard to believe this film is almost 20 years old!  "
106903,tt1291584,Adam McCreight,canada,5,I was shocked when I saw this film was rated 8.2,"I've watched some overrated films and TV shows in my time, but typically when something is rated THIS high, I can feel fairly confident that it won't be terrible. Well, I suppose that isn't the case, because this movie is borderline awful. This is nothing more than a two hour clich«∏. Every single moment of the film is utterly predictable and completely lacking in creativity. The movie tries so hard to make us feel for these characters, but in the end all I could do was cringe at the cheesiness of it all. I enjoy a film that tugs on the heart strings, and I actually enjoy some cheesiness as long as it's done well, but this film is just poorly written. I still gave it a 5, because it's not unwatchable. The acting is acceptable, and the cinematography is tolerable. My main gripe is with the writing. It's one clich«∏ after another, and with each scene all I can think of is how I'm ""supposed"" to feel, but nothing was done to actually make me feel that way. I wish people would be more stingy with their 10 star ratings, because this is NOT an 8.2 film, and it would have saved me 140 minutes if people had rated it fairly instead of handing out 10 stars like candy.

What I really loved about this movie is how a man with sheer determination can accomplish even far-fetched goals. It also shows how to pick ourselves up when we are at our lowest. The movie also highlights friendship.I think Red's friendship with Andy is the very thing that kept Red from ending up like Brooke. I really loved the part when Red said ""I'd like to think that the last thing that went through his head, other than that bullet, was how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him"".

40489,tt0120815,Adam Meledeo (meledeo@hotmail.com),united states,10,unbelievable,"Never before have I seen people cringe, stare open-mouthed, cheer, and cry, then walk out of a theater in complete silence. Having witnessed the so-called ""greatest act of terrorism ever to occur in our nation,"" I can only say we have been so naive. My generation doesn't understand what war is. We watch our movies and we get excited by violence and gore, never feeling any guilt or sorrow for the people the actors portray. This film changes all of that. It is so hard to see the men murdered as they do ""their duty"" and then come to the realization that THIS REALLY HAPPENED. These men, our grandfathers, risked and in some cases gave up their lives to protect all that we take for granted. Today we cry and demand justice for the 169 people who died because a PART of ONE building in a small city was destroyed by a bomb. We can't even begin to imagine running off of the landing boat only to be shot and killed by the unseen enemy. We see countless buildings annihilated in small, tactically insignificant cities. This movie has made a difference in my life. Being only 20, I have to face that it could easily be me in the line of fire if our nation were called once again to defend the cause of freedom and the draft were reinstated. All I can say is after seeing this movie, war and violence will no longer be glorified in my mind. Aside from the stunningly realistic portrayal of war, I can't ignore the fact that the movie itself is spectacular. Although the content takes the front seat, the acting, script, and cinematography are superior. This film is hands down the best of the year, and one of the best movies ever made. Four stars!  "

119956,tt2488496,Adam N,united states,10,"Ah get over it fanboy's, the movie was massively entertaining and better than the originals","I've watched the original Star Wars many times growing up, and I know the story inside out like anyone else. Classic films that many people like my self have been wanting back. I saw the movie today and walked away satisfied and eager for the next one. I read some of these highest rated reviews and it's literally awful how full of yourself and pessimistic some of you are. You're giving the movie a 1 star, for what? Most of you have a delusion of 30 years of fan boy gigginess that nothing released will live up to your standards, unless it was made directly after the Return of the Jedi. First of all, this is a movie, it's pure entertainment. It isn't a real galaxy, it isn't real people, it's just a movie guys. Because it doesn't add up to every painful fan boy theory you wrote in a thesis somewhere, doesn't mean the movie didn't deliver. You cannot take it this seriously. Yes, the movie followed the same guidelines to the plot as #4 that made the original successful, but there is plenty of juicy story to build on that is completely original. It pays tribute to the old, and you care about the new offspring of the main characters going forward. The story does develop perfectly from #6, 30 years later with the offspring and new heroes to root for. It gives us the best x- wing, tie fighter, millennium falcon, storm trooper, battle scene fights in any of the movies. It's modern movie making and CGI at it's best, but still giving us the unique Star Wars elements we want to see. The John Williams score is epic and masterful with the movie. The story ends for old characters in awe, and it starts new interesting story lines for other old characters continuing the story, like Chewy and Luke. This movie had to get people excited about Star Wars again. The 2000 movies weren't very good, so it had to go back to the guidelines of the original story. I suspect this movie will reflect closet to the originals story guidelines, because it had to deliver what we wanted, and the next two will develop entirely new unique adventures and story for the new heroes that will, through the characters family lineage, constantly pay tribute to the old. After reading some of these, it seems people put the originals on a pedestal. They were very good movies, but not everything was explainable or made to prove science and follow every law of nature. It's a movie. It is made to be fun, and you can't take movies that seriously. Most movies going back, including the originals, are all like this, it doesn't always have to follow physics like it seems hardcore Star Wars fans think. I don't think the movie was perfect,I would have liked to see Fin and Ray's relationship go deeper so I cared about it more. But it was very close, and the main pieces we've been waiting for have come back and are as good as before. Nothing will replace a classic, but we don't have to because this story is excellent on it's own. Just appreciate what it is, it's definitely the best Star Wars film made. It was exciting, extremely fun and satisfying, and I loved every second of it. Ray, Poe, and Fin are going to be fun to watch, and I can't wait to see Luke's role in the next one training Ray and seeing how she can harness the force against Han and Leia's kid. I took my girlfriend to see this movie, she had only seen part of the originals but somewhat knows the back story, and she knew exactly what was going on and absolutely loved it. They made it very watchable and entertaining for any level of fan. Very good movie.  "
99657,tt2096673,Adam Pape,united states,6,"Sorry guys, Pixar isn't back yet","So I saw Inside Out and I really enjoyed watching it. Now if you're wondering why I only gave it a 6 it's because I am basing my rating off how good of a film I think this movie is rather than my how much I enjoyed it. My enjoyment rating would be a 9, I had a lot of fun watching it and also the animated short at the beginning was pretty good. This is not a bad film at all but unlike everyone is saying I don't think it is a fantastic one, I see it currently has a 100% on rotten tomatoes, and I do not think it deserves that. Now when it comes to Pixar I am not really impressed with them anymore. Their more recent movies have decreased in quality and other animation companies have really stepped up their game and been improving. I can definitely say I think How to Train Your Dragon 2 is better than Inside Out. I am sure that I am not the only person who thinks that Pixar has been on a decline because I think we can all agree Cars 2 was only made to sell merchandise, and even die hard Pixar fans can say Brave wasn't that great. The whole appeal to Pixar and why everyone liked them so much is because they were original and stood out from the competition. But lately they have gotten very formulaic and they most commonly rip off their own movies. Another reason Pixar was so good was because of their superb animation, but lately other animation companies are starting to look just as good. Pixar has always had fantastic texture and environment design, and with Inside Out this is still true but nothing really stood out and their character design needs to be better if they want to stay ahead of the competition. Lately you can see a big trend of them doing sequels like Toy Story 3, Cars 2, and Monsters University, and we are getting even more with Finding Dory, and Incredibles 2. And they are doing this only to sell millions of dollars in merchandise. So you can see my problem after I said that what made Pixar great was being original. When I saw the trailer to Inside Out, what worried me was they did the whole ""hey we are Pixar, remember all those movies we made that you love!"" I honestly think if they hadn't done that the movie wouldn't have been as anticipated and it could've been advertised as a DreamWorks movie. So as in terms of the actual movie, there was nothing that I particularly didn't like about it. It's just that many things were not as good as it could've been and it was also predictable and many characters and elements were not as interesting as they should've been. I thought the plot was a little predictable, and there were some conveniences and events that felt a little lazy. like how each of the islands fall just as they got to them, or how the island crashes into the Train of Thought while they are on it. There are a couple things that don't make sense, like how losing hockey island makes Riley suddenly suck, I thought it was just part of her personality, and not her abilities. And how she sometimes acts bipolar, like one moment really happy talking about her childhood, and then later she is crying in the middle of class. And when they lose the islands of personality does that literally mean she has no personality, is she just a hallow person with no personality and feelings about anything. I know in that these are minor issues and shouldn't be taken so seriously in a kids movie, it's just when everyone is saying that this movie is tailored a lot towards adults and deals with something as complex as the human brain, I can't help but wonder about these things. I would say that the biggest problem that this movie suffers from is with the characters. Now the characters aren't bad and I actually liked all the emotions and thought they were funny and they were terrifically voice acted, it's just that you don't care about any of them. A large part of this issue is with the fact that they are literally emotions so you know how they are going to respond. Fear is going to be afraid, Anger is going to be angry, Sadness is going to be sad, and so on. The only person that shows other emotions beside the one that they literally are is Joy who has the most diverse personality among the five of them. It's just hard to relate and care about a character when they are bound to feeling and reacting one way throughout the entire film. Also a problem is that the human characters that you can actually flesh out are given the least attention. The hardest human character to care about is actually Riley; this is because you know that everything she does is the emotions inside her head. And since these emotions are actual characters in the movie it makes it seem like they are controlling her and Riley has no free will at all. I know it may seem like I am really hating on this movie but I'm not. There is much enjoyment to be had in it and if you are looking for a family movie to take your kids to they will love it. I just can't overlook the fact that this is a Pixar movie and therefore could've been a lot better when compared to their older movies. I grow more concerned for Pixar's direction as a company when they keep releasing unoriginal and underwhelming films. This is an alright movie and I did enjoy more than a lot of Pixar's more recent films, but unfortunately this is not a return to Pixar's glory days.  "
101794,tt3170832,Adam Parks,canada,9,A darkly beautiful incubated snapshot of a mother-son relationship,"Flashbacks and dream sequences are traded for raw, uninterrupted life in the room that boldly encapsulates 94 of the film's 188-minute runtime. The shed's cold interior is wearied on the eyes, Jack and Joy's various crafts applying faint signs of life, and as we are left to witness a darkly beautiful incubated snapshot of a mother-son relationship; the anger, the amendments, the curiosity, the tears, the laughs. And surrounding it all are four unforgiving walls, which, once knocked down, the simplest joys of a boy and a dog, bedrooms, family dinners make for some of the most uniquely liberating cinematic moments of recent memory.

130001,tt1895587,Adam Parks,canada,8,An intricate balancing act,"Where the cast shines brightest, however, are the moments in between when there is no center attention. Writer (and Director) Tom McCarthy and co-writer Josh Singer have each one of these reporters contributing to the investigation in some meaningful way∂?be it interviewing traumatized victims or unearthing sensitive documents there's an evident feeling of cooperation and balance. Though the same can't be said in terms of character, McAdams and d' Arcy James allotted significantly simpler means of development, the visits to the duo's respected arcs are kept brief∂?illustrating these moments as personal glimpses rather than forced sympathy. Schreiber embodied this aspect in his underused performance, where a couple of the film's handful of memorable scenes sees the Jewish editor opposite to the Cardinal, Schreiber donning a weary expression with a firm tone of voice to craft a motivated but emotionally suppressed performance that only began to bud.

150494,tt1663202,Adam Parks,canada,9,"Crazed, animalistic, and committed","Still, for as much as the environment is in the spotlight, DiCaprio and Hardy are undoubtedly the two consistent driving forces. Rendering John with an inherent craze, Hardy employs the same commutative eyes from The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max: Fury Road, except behind a barbaric wad of facial hair, almost biker gang-esque∂?making his less morally inclined reflection of Hugh into a dangerously unpredictable survivalist. Not to be outdone, DiCaprio has reportedly called this role the most taxing of his career. Upon research it's easy to see why: not only did the vegetarian actor consume a hunk of raw bison's liver, but he also had to learn to properly shoot a musket, build a fire, speak both Pawnee and Arikara languages, and study ancient healing methods. But you don't need to hop on Google to fully appreciate DiCaprio's commitment, just witnessing the actor crawl through the snow and dirt, devour a raw fish∂?in a enormous fur coat, scraping bone marrow from an already-devoured corpse, the actor is evidently immersed in this animalistic transformation. And, interestingly enough, DiCaprio, speaking maybe 20 or so lines in the entire film, likely made the conscious decision to opt for a more physically demanding role when turning down the lead for Steve Jobs and Sorkin's witty dialogue. After all, since The Academy didn't award his vulgar wolf the year prior it only makes sense that now he actually has to become one.

154859,tt3659388,Adam Parks,canada,9,Sci-fun,"If the jubilant 80s soundtrack and snappy wisecracks of last year's lively space romp, 'Guardians of the Galaxy,' revived the sanguine sci-fi, then Ridley Scott's 'The Martian' has taught it to walk. In what could have easily echoed Warner Bros.' award-winning space disaster epic, 'Gravity,' 'The Martian,' rather, not only evokes an optimistic outlook on space exploration but also injects a rebellious dose of realism and humor despite its eccentric protagonist being stranded 140 million miles from the planet we call home. Reserving its 'Gravity' parallels to the beautiful CGI crimson storm of an opening sequence, echoing 'Alien'-like helmet lamps in the process, Commander Melissa Lewis (Jessica Chastain) is subsequently forced to withdraw her exploration crew from the red planet. Although the team of Kate Mara, Aksel Hennie, Sebastian Stan, and a delightful Michael Pena escape Mars in one piece ∂? Chastain's Melissa made the strenuous decision of abandoning Botanist Mark Watney (Matt Damon) after being separated by the storm and impaled by a radio antenna, suggesting his suit has been severely breached. Yet, the very antenna that stranded Watney also plugged the breach, which in itself is a miracle if it wasn't immediately overshadowed by the fact that he's also trapped on Mars with only enough sols (Martian days) of food to last just over a year; the next mission arrives in 4. Henceforth, Watney is tasked with growing food on a planet where nothing grows; finding water on a planet where none flows (as of filming); and communicate with NASA millions of miles away ∂? all of which Watney accomplishes with a smile, witty self documentation, and survival proficiently that would make Les Stroud proud and Neil Armstrong weep.

90753,tt0097576,Adam Peabody,united states,10,I've never voted 10 for a film. Ever.," This is one of those remarkably few films that is both commercially successful as well as a cinematic WORK. Spielberg, who I typically have reservations about, truly outdoes himself in this film by directing Ford, and Connery in their best roles ever. Speaking from the perspective of a perpetual 007 fan, I have to give Connery his fair share here as an ACTOR. This is working in the business at its finest. Being around actors and crew members all the time, I have to appreciate what has been accomplished in this movie. Kudos to all involved...even to Ben Burtt for his foleyed rats. Only in my latest viewing did it occur to me that those aren't really rats squealing away but foley artists in a studio somewhere in Burbank. Congrats!  "
8615,tt0468569,Adam Peters,united kingdom,9,Batman for a new generation,"(87%) When I first heard that the Joker was making a return as the main villain I had my doubts from the start. Jack Nicholson played the role so well that I couldn't imagine anyone ever getting close, and the Ledger name I couldn't help but associate with that pretty poor Knights tale movie. But even though the character is different, so therefore somewhat difficult to fully compare, Ledger was as brilliant as Nicholson, which is huge praise coming from me and a very welcome surprise. The film wastes no time in introducing the Joker (about 5 mins), but we never really learn anything about him which normally is a bad thing, but here it works as the audience has to almost make up their own back-story around what little is given to them. For a movie rated 12 this is still quite a hard-edged watch, as the true evil of the Joker is never sugar coated. Bale is a better than most Batman/Wayne even if the grainy voice he uses is still a flawed concept, and Michael Caine's lines always seem to be speech based. But overall this is a very impressive comic book crime movie that's worthy of its gold standard. "
18892,tt0120737,Adam Peters,united kingdom,10,Thank you Mr Jackson,"(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.  "
36397,tt0038650,Adam Peters,united kingdom,10,It's a wonderful film,"(92%) Could this be the best Christmas movie of all time? Well if it is then the fact that it doesn't stuff elves, a fat man in a Coca-cola winter suit, and endless amounts of consumer based gift buying down the audience's throat helps matters greatly. Performance wise it has James Stewart playing a big hearted everyman without it ever once feeling forced or unrealistic because it shows both the good and bad elements of trying to the right thing in life. The plot does share more than a little similar elements than ""A Christmas carol"", only it focuses on a good man rather than an old miser, which if anything works just as well as it doesn't pull as hard on the regret emotion which is something one doesn't really want to feel too much around the end of the year. Above all else though this is a timeless classic, with great direction, well drawn characters, a brilliant sweet ending, and best of all it actually shows, in most powerful fashion, that Christmas can be an awful time of year if things aren't running smoothly, which is something really lacking from almost every other holiday movie making this 100% unmissable for all true cinema fans.  "
38591,tt0110413,Adam Peters,united kingdom,10,A faultless crime classic,"(93%) A sublime crime drama with a cold heart of pure gold, a fast pace, some high tension, and a unique approach to its ideas. The mix of French charm and style with American cinema combine perfectly making this a truly different breed of film that just has to be admired. Jean Reno is perfect in the lead role (except for maybe the fact that he's clearly French and not even trying an Italian accent), Gary Oldman plays one of the best film baddies ever, and Natalie Portman was destined to become a star after her fine performance. This is a true must-watch classic that should be counted amongst the all-time greats and a top ten pick from the 1990's.  "
44056,tt0816692,Adam Peters,united kingdom,9,So well made that the flaws almost don't matter,"(89%) One of the more ambitious sci-fi movies of recent years that works both for and against it; although this is a film truly worth tracking down simply because it is such a general cinematic achievement that like ""Gravity"" really needs to be seen in a cinema to be properly experienced. The performances are as one would expect with McConaughey leading well, even if he has been better, and nobody could be accused of letting the side down; while the direction is faultless, and at times totally sublime with many shots that are both haunting and beautiful. Once the final few reels make their rounds the plot takes one too many contrivances that push things a little beyond reason, but this is still an epic trip through time and space that has enough heart and human spirit to get past the bulk of the science flimflam.  "
53552,tt2582802,Adam Peters,united kingdom,8,A highly tuned pile-driver of a drama,"(77%) A film void of death, murder, and violence, yet is as intense as any thriller, horror, or action flick. With parallels to ""Foxcatcher"", with the student and trainer theme, only here J.K Simmons' character is not a fraud, but in fact is very gifted, and if anything is even more hardcore in his approach. Miles Teller is perfect as the gifted student, you really do believe every step of the way that the guy can achieve something if pushed, but you never truly know for sure if he is being pushed too far. This has all the bases covered in terms of acting, writing, and direction, with J.K Simmons brilliant performance just about nosing it above all else as the best asset. There's also some white-knuckle plot twists, a huge amount of politically incorrect insults thrown around, and a brilliant (and somewhat deafening) ending. A fondness for jazz isn't required to get something from this in the same sense that you don't need to like boxing to really enjoy Rocky, and as such this is deserving of a look for almost anyone looking for something well made, interesting, and memorable.  "
72327,tt0033467,Adam Peters,United Kingdom,8,"Deep, well-made, and ahead of its time","(78%) A film that you've seen referenced more times than your're probably even aware. So ignoring most of the influence and admiration that surrounds this, how exactly does a film often regarded as one of the greatest ever actually stack up? Well it's certainly an ambitious film with hardly a single second wasted in expressing its tale of a super wealthy tycoon, which for me at least is a perfect message of the actual reality of riches and success; that truth be told the pursuit of wealth and influence is in a way a con. This is a film that's very much of its time, yet it still has this timeless feel to it, mainly because it tells its tale so well. The second half of the film is as near perfect conclusion as you'll ever likely get from any film, the direction was way ahead of its time, and there's a great sense of sadness that runs through almost everything that still holds up even today. This honestly is not one of my personal favourite films ever, not sure exactly why it just isn't, but as far as a classic films go this is indeed a must watch that should be tracked down by all true cinema fans.  "
81668,tt0435761,Adam Peters,United Kingdom,10,A great third chapter to a great series,"(91%) I'm really not a big fan of these computer based animation movies that continually come out every other month without delay, they just don't interest me. But Toy story series has always a step up from the norm, and I must admit that this is one of the very best second sequels out there. This is a charming, funny, sweet, sharply clever action filled adventure filled with so many great characters (the big baby doll is genuinely creepy at times) , and it has more than a little touch of weepiness towards the end. The sense of passing youth and time in general is sublimely well crafted, and throughout this is hugely entertaining. All in all a great addition to family cinema.  "
88989,tt0119488,Adam Peters,United Kingdom,5,"A good movie, but come on, it's really not THAT good","(46%) I cannot help but feel that this is more than a touch overrated. And although it is a good movie without much doubt, I just don't understand the buckets of a admiration that so many people have towards it. Yes it's well made and acted, but it's also flat, overly long, and quite a joyless watch too, while the plot is nothing that hasn't been done many times before with its good cop caught between his corrupt allies and superiors. One thing that this does do well is that it feels like an actual portrayal of the darker side of criminal life back then (although when Guy Pearce uses a handlkerchief to open the door to the night owl cafe with its two billion finger prints smothered all over it, I couldn't help but chuckle) even compared to the original movies of that period this has more guts with its swear laden script and more explicitly sleazy elements that wouldn't have ever passed through the censors back in the 40s-early 50's. This overall thanks to its better elements is worth a look, but I don't feel it's the modern classic many claim it to be.  "
92481,tt0055630,Adam Peters,united kingdom,8,An important piece of world cinema,"(73%) Watching this it's pretty clear to anyone that A fist full of dollars owes almost its entire existence to this Japanese classic. Almost from the very beginning, right down to the performances, direction, and script, this has the feel of a classic Leone western as the guy clearly helped himself to bits and pieces. And he must have figured that he'd largely get away with it because so few western people at the time would have ever actually had the chance to even know about this far-east hit. For anyone interested in classic Asian films, or just classic films in general, this is a must- watch that's well worth tracking down. There's a fair share of action, fun, and sheer entertainment value to be had from this quality, and still watchable first rate winner.  "
93629,tt0372784,Adam Peters,united kingdom,8,"HUGE improvement over ""Crapman and Robin""","(78%) A strong reboot of a fallen superhero series that really needed a large sidestep away from the god-awful let-down ""Batman and Robin"" disaster. Begins is one of the finest made superhero flicks to date, with fantastic scope and a lot more depth than any up to that point. The cast is strong, the writing is more than good enough, and there's some great action in there too. Maybe the only real issue is that it's not as memorable as 89 Batman as every time I see it (3 times now) it feels like the first time, as nothing really resonates in my mind for some reason. It's still one of the best Batman films, just for me it's not the best.  "
97261,tt0081398,Adam Peters,united kingdom,9,DeNiro doesn't come much better than this,"(89%) You can tell that this is a Scorsese film through the sheer number of aggravated physical brawls (and not forgetting the no less aggressive verbal fights) which break out every 10 minutes or so, and that's not including any of actual boxing matches themselves. And that's this film's finest accomplishment in that Jake LaMotta isn't a nice guy (which is putting it lightly), and yet seeing him fail is no less painful or easy to witness. Predominantly this is a brilliantly well made with the black and white cinematography being more than just a gimmick as it fits into the stark tale, DeNiro I don't think has ever been better, and the use of score is some of the best in any movie. Overall a must watch.  "
104972,tt0112641,Adam Peters,united kingdom,7,"Not Martin's best, but better than most","(70%) ""Goodfellas in Las Vegas"" holds up as one of the better crime movies of the 1990's. It's a movie of two halves with the first covering the operation as a whole with quite a lot of detail regarding the inner workings of their sleaze pit, and the second deals more with the downfall of each character. Sharon Stone plays one of the most hateful god-diggers ever, and Joe Pesci is more or less the same character he played in Goodfellas. The movie ends with other side of all that money, jewels, and luxury in a bitter tasting manner with a really quite brutal death scene highlighting the reality of greed and power and where it can lead. This is undoubtedly a good film, but Goodfellas is better, funnier, and overall stronger.  "
107579,tt0993846,Adam Peters,united kingdom,7,Good film about a pretty bad person,"(69%) The pairing of Scorsese and DiCaprio runs on, and is now as strong as the DeNiro partnership. This is the most full-on production of the duo yet, and is very likely to remain so for some time at least, although it must be said that it is not really that overly shocking. There is quite a bit of nudity and sex, but only prudish fools get upset about that, and the swearing becomes unnoticeable after the first five minutes, likewise the tons and tons of drugs filling the screen. DiCaprio is fantastic and this is worthy of a watch just for his performance alone, the brilliant scene of him crawling on the ground to get to his Lamborghini after one too many funny pills shows a more physical side of his talent which is not always shown. The run length is as excessive as Belfort himself as a good 25-30 mins could have easily made it into deleted scenes, but I never once got bored, just a little bit tired of it all after about two and a half hours in. It's also well worth a look simply to get an account of the devils pulling all the strings to the financial world, and at times the feeling that the FBI cannot get the handcuffs out quickly enough and put these guys away is very strong. One of Scorsese's good films, but not one of his best.  "
112507,tt0046912,Adam Peters,united kingdom,8,From stage to screen in fine form,"(74%) A fine example of stage to screen transition handled with all the flare and know how of a true legend. Grace Kelly is the target of murder from her own husband, and just like ""Rear window"", in which James Stewart is practically harassed to agree to marry her, it is a difficult concept to fully relate with. I mean how many men lucky enough to be married to Grace Kelly would arrange to have her killed? You'd have to be insane, even if she is fooling around. The almost single location works better than expected. It never gets dull to watch. And once everything has been established this becomes more and more interesting as the minutes go quite quickly past. This isn't Hitchcock's best ever, but it does fit in just below the better examples.  "
114982,tt0061512,Adam Peters,united kingdom,10,A rebel movie for everyone,"(93%) One of the finest films ever made about the rebellious spirit of man, which is perfectly cast by both super cool Paul Newman and George Kennedy in the lead roles. Newman's low dialogue, yet not exactly silent role, is filled with subtle brilliance as you know exactly what the guy is thinking and feeling every single time he appears on screen, which is something beyond the control of both the writer and director, it's just 100% Paul. The movie is one of great memorable moments such as the mass egg eating scene, the road sanding scene, and the brilliant part in which Newman sings a few lines of plastic Jesus that shows exactly how he's feeling more than normal spoken words ever could. This is a superb film, and anyone who considers themselves even a small fan of cinema should watch this at least once in their lives.  "
125083,tt2267998,Adam Peters,united kingdom,8,"Not perfect, but still a fine mystery","(73%) More or less a modern day remake/re-imagining of Alfred Hitchcock's 1941 ""Suspicion"", with weirdly issues surrounding the ending for each of them not quite holding water. This is at the very least one of the better mystery movies of the year, with pretty perfect direction, very strong performances from the all sections of the cast, and a script that keeps you guessing for most of its quite epic run time. By the time of the last quarter the plot has tied itself into such a tight web that quite large amounts of implausibility is needed to continue its way onwards to the quite abrupt feeling ending. All in all though this is a finely made suspense filled hit that deserves attention.  "
131629,tt1392190,Adam Peters,united kingdom,8,"A fun, but not faultless return for Max","(79%) A remake?/sequel? that really, really goes for it full force in the face and in doing so largely impresses, yet doesn't quite take the crown of the very best of the series which is, and probably always will be, Mad Max 2. Tom Hardy fills the role that Mel left behind in the mid eighties, though this time Max hardly has more than a few lines of dialogue in the entire film, but then he was never a big talker, with a bulk of the attention and lines left for solely Charlize Theron's character. This is a visually epic looking film with TONS of loud, fast well shot action, though I missed the more subtle elements of the other instalments that this doesn't have as much of. Plot wise this is a near remake of beyond thunderdome with a few different ideas running through, some of them good, some not so great. In terms of all-out action this is a must watch. It's hugely entertaining and very well made, it's also worthy of the Mad Max name, which is probably its biggest accomplishment.  "
132904,tt2024544,Adam Peters,united kingdom,10,A modern masterpiece,"(92%) Any movie that makes me feel angry at my own race is doing something right. Without a doubt this is a film everyone should watch, and I can only guess why this story is not as well known as it should be (hopefully thanks to this movie it now will be) is purely down to white guilt. The direction here is sublimely good throughout, the writing is perfect and never manipulative or forced, the characters believable and Ejiofor couldn't be any better in the lead role. It's not an easy watch at times, just as it should be, but it's so worthy of a look as an overall finely-made and important piece of cinema. And as such this comes highly recommended.  "
133810,tt2278388,Adam Peters,united kingdom,9,A brilliant comic hit,"(90%) A vibrant, although somewhat bleak in parts, yet very wonderful comedic cinematic treat. No film quite feels, looks and sounds quite like this, it's a real marvel. The direction is perfectly calculated and every single scene, or even shot, is finely framed to a tee. The performances from the vast and famous cast are sublime with Fiennes leading the way with a note perfect turn, and the writing is impeccable and very funny. The sheer quality throughout of every single aspect cannot be denied by even the most fussy of film fan. This comes highly recommended to anyone in favour of quality fimmaking in their comedy, and I cannot wait to see this again.  "
138788,tt0120382,Adam Peters,united kingdom,9,A highlight in Carrey's career,"(89%) The movie that set Carrey apart from all his other roles up to that point, and shed some light on the idea of he being more than just a loud, rubber faced jester, but an actual actor. This is a great film that took me more than one sitting to fully appreciate, mainly because I was expecting an out-and-out Carrey comedy, not a dramatic mind-bender with a fantastic high-concept premise. The premise itself is handled perfectly and could have been very easily been ruined by a lesser writer or director. The use of music is brilliant, and there is a lot of subtly combined in the bolder elements making this a rewarding sit that can be enjoyed again and again.  "
145556,tt1392214,Adam Peters,united kingdom,8,A grim slide into a very real type of hell,"(73%) Without too much doubt this is one of the better films of the year, with its fantastically solid direction, Oscar worthy performances, a great script/plot that keeps you guessing until the end, but my god is it a hard film to sit through at times. It really is the most bleak and joyless productions since 2009's ""The road"" and I have rarely ever seen anything as good and yet wanted it to be over quite as much as this trip into a very real (yet still a little Hollywood) hell. The roads this goes down are the stuff of actual nightmares, and when that is combined with the very grim, cold setting it makes for an increasingly oppressive feel.

146650,tt0338564,Adam Peters,united kingdom,6,"A strong, intelligent, Hong Kong cop thriller","(59%) A slick, well made, modern Hong Kong big-hitter that tells its tale of undercover law enforcement perfectly well. This really tries to be more than just another far-east action movie, with plenty of screen time for the characters to breath, while the main focus surrounds plot development rather than fights and action. As this does almost shy away form action, which clearly does add more depth, but it also marks this apart from the simpler, more strait-forward movies of this type, which might put some people off. But if you stick with it and put the effort in, then you're rewarded with a deeper, more complex beast than most cop thrillers from this part of the world.  "
149553,tt0072890,Adam Peters,united kingdom,8,"Great editing, acting, and a sense of realism make this shine","(77%) One of the better bank robbery crime movies featuring Al Pacino in unstoppable form as the stressed-out thief with somewhat different intentions than the regular hold-up guy. The basic premise of bank robbery is a text book big Hollywood staple, and this looks and feels like a big Hollywood film; but it also has something extra that most movies of this type don't, which is that this actually happened, so there's a distinct element of realism running right the way through the entire film. It takes not very long at all to realise that Pacino and John Cazale aren't going to pull off the heist successfully, but this is still an engrossing watch that's well worth tracking down.  "
153143,tt2084970,Adam Peters,united kingdom,7,A worthy film for a remarkable man,"(70%) A handsomely made, decently paced, informative war-time intelligence drama headlined with one of the best performances of the year. Cumberbatch is truly brilliant here, and I am now officially a fully fledged fan of his, while Keira Knightley continues the throw away the shackles of the dreadful Pirates of the Caribbean sequels. There are numerous quite gripping scenes, more than a few touching parts, and by the end an annoyed biting feeling to the way in which Alan Turing's was treated after everything he had done for so many people. It may not be a 100% must watch, but as far as catch if you can movies go, this is one of the finest of the year.  "
154371,tt3659388,Adam Peters,united kingdom,7,A nice rocket ride while it lasts,"(68%) A well made space survival adventure that mixes Apollo 13, Castaway and Interstellar in a very watchable treat that marks a lighter entry into Ridley Scott's filmography. The pacing is sharp, the performances from the strong cast are solid and this never becomes anything other than a likable sit. Unlike something such as Castaway the plot is more required to follow both the captive (Matt Damon) and the rest of the cast who's only objective is to try and help rescue him, so there is a fair amount of switching between the two focal points rather than pure Matt Damon in space trying to get by. Without doubt this is a band apart from the lesser films of the year, but I doubt it will top my list mainly because for me it came and went without hardly any lasting impact. So by the end it is enjoyable while it lasts with plenty of heart and entertainment value, but it didn't send as many shock-waves upon me as it did so many others. Nice throwback soundtrack though.  "
155772,tt2015381,Adam Peters,united kingdom,7,Pure sci-fi popcorn fun,"(67%) A vastly watchable, very fun, witty, fully fledged sci-fi action comedy with a great nostalgic soundtrack (even if old cassettes in reality sound a lot more fuzzy). The confidence shown by Marvel is commendable as the very pretty visuals must have cost a very pretty penny, and considering I've never even heard of the comic books before then the studio executives must have big cojones to green-light a relatively obscure series. The unending sharp sense of humour works well, and the writing in general is better than most with stuff always happening without it ever feeling like too much. It may just be a big flashy popcorn movie, but it's a fine exciting example of the breed making this a worthy one to watch at the cinema, with strong hope of more goodness yet to come.  "
157686,tt0848228,Adam Peters,united kingdom,7,"Very big, very fun, very Hollywood","(69%) All that build up from all those already very big movies was about worth it as this is quite an accomplishment to not only bring together all those superheroes, but also to give them each an pretty equal share of screen time and importance. The script works well despite the plot being very big budget Hollywood, and it has some nice funny touches here and there. The final battle in New York (where was Spider-man when all this was going on?) is very well developed that sticks to the equal share of each character very well and gives a good portion of what the audience want to see (action mayhem). This is without doubt one of the better superhero movies ever, and one of the best Marvel movies to date. Roll on the next mammoth.  "

If The 6th Sense doesn't go down in history as one of the best in the horror/thriller genre, it would only be because it is so difficult to find the proper genre in which to pigeonhole this movie. It hasn't been since Rushmore that I've sat through a movie (in a mainstream theater) and thought to myself as the film was running, ""this is a very good movie..."". The acting in this film is great. The kid is phenomenal. The images are suitably eerie at times and the soundtrack is as well. Sure the ending is good, but the film as when viewed as a whole is one of the best of the year...and you can trust my opinion...  "
153574,tt1431045,Adam Post,united states,9,Time to make the chimi-f***in-changas!,"Now you may be wondering why someone who saw this AWESOME movie opening weekend is writing a review NOW? The very simple answer: Batman V Superman sucked (I wrote a bad review for it) and it made me want to praise a recent comic book movie that DIDN'T suck! Ever since that abomination they called ""Deadpool"" in X-Men Origins: Wolverine I became a pretty big fan of the REAL Deadpool. I own and have read the entire ""Deadpool & Cable"" series and the ""Merc with a Mouth"" series and absolutely love them. I will admit when this movie was announced, I didn't know much about early (90's) Deadpool which is what the movie was based on, but I did know Deadpool himself. Now for the review: This movie was perfect from the opening credits all the way to the ending credits. They made me laugh, they were creative and it's even funnier if you know how the opening credits came to be (LOOK IT UP!) I don't watch comedies very often, but how I judge them is simple: how much time out of the movie do I spend laughing my @$$ off! In Deadpool, the answer is THE WHOLE TIME!Between breaking the fourth wall, pop culture references, and references to other movies (both Marvel movies & Ryan Reynold's movies) the only way you cannot laugh is if you have no sense of humor (or a clean one, which is boring!) As for the story, it is Deadpool's origin story. Long story short, Wade Wilson (Deadpool) gets cancer, he's made an offer he can't refuse (well he does at first) and in curing his cancer, he becomes horribly disfigured. He then goes on a revenge mission to kill Francis/Ajax (he doesn't like the name Francis!) My only real complaint to the story was, much like Iron-Man 3, it jumped around a lot/wasn't chronological. That's just a personal pet peeve though; probably won't bother everyone. The characters: Deadpool - the Merc-with-a-Mouth out for revenge. Vanessa - Wade's girlfriend/future baby-mama. Weasel - Deadpool's BFF/weapons dealer/intel guy. Colossus - The big CGI metal guy from the X-Men. Negasonic Teenage Warhead - The moody teen/X-Men protegee. Francis/Ajax - British villain who turns wade into an abomination. Angel Dust - Francis' right-hand woman who does most of his dirty work. Summary: The movie plays out in such a way that it will please action fans, comedy fans, comic fans, and honestly probably anyone with a messed-up sense of humor. If you're okay with swearing, inappropriate jokes, sex and lots of blood; THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU! If not, well then that's too bad (you're missing out!) Final verdict: I WOULD give Deadpool a full 10/10 instead of 9/10, if not for these 2 things: 1. The non-chronological story (like I said, just a personal pet peeve) 2. I saw it opening weekend as well as the following weekend, and it wasn't as funny the second time. I'm not saying it wan't AWESOME a second time, I'm just saying that when I buy it on Blu-ray I can't watch it too often/soon. I gotta leave some time in-between viewings so the jokes aren't fresh in my mind. GO SEE THIS MOVIE, AND BUY IT WHEN IT COMES OUT! IT DESERVES EVERY PENNY IT'S MADE! GOOD JOB FOX/MARVEL!  "

There are some movies that I cringe my way through, or am so bored that I check the time and can't wait for it to be over, but not the LOTR. This movie perfectly captures the world that Tolkien created by combining several flawless elements that work to make this one of the best movies ever made. The acting, cast, CGI, wardrobe, and general attention to the simplest of details are what makes this a truly magical movie. From the mountain of books in the background of Bilbo's study, to the rust and grime on the armor of the Orc berserkers, it's the painstaking attention to detail that makes this movie endlessly re-watchable, and timelessly beautiful.

The cast was what instantly sold me on this one - with movie greats like Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and a very intimidating performance by Lawrence Tierney, this movie's attention to the characters, is what truly makes it great. Tarantino's legendary directing guides this film through, what could have been, monotonous scenes with ease.

I am capable of suspending disbelief for the sake of a good story with unexpected twists but the twist in this story comes so early that the viewer can spend the next hour pulling apart everything that is wrong AND everything that goes wrong with the plot from that point on. My first signs that the movie was in trouble were when a nation wide search is conducted a missing woman wouldn't consider a better make over? Maybe black hair? just an idea. As for killing her rich stalker ? This is where the story goes from OK to ridiculous. Camera footage in the house ,alibi, the diary?.. it felt like the last 30 mins was supposed to be 1.5hrs and they shortened the movie and expected us to just assume that checks were done by the FBI etc. A sign of good story is where you read IMDb goofs and go ""hey I didn't notice that "" not finding yourself constantly saying to yourself ""hey...that would NEVER happen"". The acting was good but this film would have been a lot better if it gave you a greater reason to hate the husband to justify an elaborate escape other than ""oh..I'm a sociopath""and it ended with his arrest and her driving into the sunset.

When I watched the trailer on the 27th June 2013 to remind myself of it it nearly got me to see the movie again, the 2008 hit certainly has proved well and has led on well for the Dark Knight Rises.

39110,tt0245429,Adam Ragg,united kingdom,9,Exceeds all expectations.,"I recently bought this on DVD for my 11 year old sister as a birthday present. The only real background info on it I had at the time was that it was an anime in the vein of Alice In Wonderland. However, in all aspects, (including the one that is most often in contention among anime fans, the English dub,) reached and then exceeded my expectations. Chihiro is a little girl who is unwilling to join in with her gung-ho parents who are setting off to live in a new town. However, when her father's bad driving has them at a dead end in a forest glade, they discover a tunnel that leads into what seems to be an abandoned theme park town. However, when the sun goes down it becomes clear that this is a ghost town of a different sort, a place where spirits return each evening to relax and refresh themselves. Chihiro finds herself working at the towering Bath-house of the Spirits and trying to find a way of getting back to her home, encountering many incredible creatures along the way, including the brave water spirit/dragon Haku, gruff but kindly boiler-man Komaji, cranky witch/owner of the bath-house Yubaba and the mysterious wraith No-Face. On the strength of the US English dub, it is an enjoyable and exhilarating film, with a well-written story, fantastic dialogue and, given the nature of the film, totally believable characters. Daveigh Chase is marvelous as Chihiro, and brings across her complex emotional states brilliantly. The supporting cast, including many Disney regulars, are on top form, and whilst it has no real stars on board, the skill of those involved proves it isn't necessary. I often found myself wondering if Wendee Lee was one of the cast members, but on discovering it was Susan Egan I felt like a complete dolt. David Ogden Stiers, the Peter Sellers of Disney, is a treat as Komaji, and Jason Marsden and Suzanne Pleshette are fairly engaging as Haku and Yubaba/Zeniba respectively. Bob Bergen and John Ratzenberger both make good cameos as well. The visuals and sound are crisp and clean and unpretentious, the story is accessible whilst still being quirky and inventive. Whilst at the time of it's release I was repelled by the fact that it seemed a tad too Disney-ish, I now think I can safely say I was wrong. This isn't Alice In Wonderland; it's in a whole different class. And by the way, my sister loved it too.  "

From beginning to finish, Interstellar tells an incredible story of how a father has to leave his family behind to find a new Earth and save humanity. The movie never has a dull moment and leaves the audience entertained throughout. I'm definitely not one to cry at sad films, but this one made me shed a tear midway through. This is a perfect film for people who love science fiction and people looking for a new genre to enjoy. This film definitely deserves to be known as one of the best of all time because of what it's impact has on the person who watches it.  "

158499,tt0848228,Adam Ross,australia,7,"Very good, but not the greatest.","Hey guys. I've written a HUGE review of this. Here is the first few paragraphs. Head over to www.thecrat.com to read my full review. Disclaimer: if you're anything like me, you want to go into The Avengers as blind as possible. I will try to avoid addressing the majority of the plot, but when I have to clearly address plot points I will mark them as spoilers. 2012 is gearing up to be the biggest year in film ever. With new entries into some of the most beloved franchises of all time (Lord of the Rings, Alien, James Bond and Batman) it is a good year to be a film geek. The first of the year's massive releases arrives in the form of The Avengers (sorry, Hunger Games, you have the box office, but not the scope to join the heavy hitters). The question everyone (or just geeks) is asking: is this the best comic book film ever? I would have to answer with an emphatic no. This film is big, huge in fact, and it gets a lot of things right. But I also think, considering the pedigree and lead-up to this film, The Avengers should have been a game-changer. Unfortunately, it is not. The Avengers is the culmination of the 'Marvel Studios' Cinematic Universe'. Marvel has created a series of films starring their heroes (Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and The Incredible Hulk) that all coincide in the same reality (just like the comic books). This connectivity has been planned from the start so that when Marvel was ready, they could join these characters into a single film. That moment has arrived with The Avengers. The Avengers is primarily made for fans of these films: if you have skipped the previous films and missed the back-story, you may find that your enjoyment of this new entry is limited. The plot of The Avengers sees the demigod Loki (the great, snarling Tom Hiddleston) planning to enslave the entirety of the human race. Minor spoilers: after his exile in Thor, Loki finds himself in a strange portion of the universe, one controlled by an alien race known as the Chitauri (the identity of this race is inconsequential, and it is revealed within the first few moments of The Avengers). Loki plans to use the Chitauri's numbers to achieve his goal of world domination. Once Loki makes his presence known on earth, it is up to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to unite earth's mightiest heroes into a force capable of combating Loki and the Chitauri. The man primarily responsible for this cinematic interpretation of the comic is Joss Whedon. Whedon acts as the writer and director of The Avengers and it is far and away his biggest undertaking yet. Mainly known for his television work (Buffy and Firefly), Whedon has only ever directed one other film: the low-scale (compared to The Avengers) Serenity. Marvel Studios has a reputation of hiring risky or untested (in big budget films) actors and directors to make their films (the recovering addict Robert Downey Jnr as Iron Man, the relatively unknown Chris Hemsworth as Thor) and the majority of these decisions have paid off gloriously. Unfortunately, Whedon isn't exactly one of them. Despite being an authority on geek culture, Whedon's pacing, plot and cinematic eye are good, but they still leave a lot to be desired. This is a quantum leap in terms of his career and Whedon (mostly) steps up to the plate. The Avengers would be a daunting prospect for any director, let alone one with a single film under their belt. Whedon is largely regarded for his writing and in The Avengers it is very much hit and miss. He nails the characters' voices and his dialogue is mostly fantastic (except for a few Downey Jnr quips ∂? but knowing him, I'd imagine they are improvised).However, his basic plot framework is quite muddled. A film of this calibre should function like a well-oiled machine, not feel like it is made out of spare parts. To read the rest head to www.thecrat.com  "

The gorgeous Audrey Tautou gives a masterful performance as the bold, yet introverted, title character and captures your heart from the first few scenes in which she appears.

There is so much symbolism and hidden layers to everything that happens that I'm both excited to watch it again and terrified. All I can say to you is that Apocalypse Now is for two hours an extraordinary film that jumps from a fast- paced, balls-to-the-wall action film to a slow-moving war drama faster than it jumps scenes. The final act, however, will leave you twisted, confused and unsure of how you feel about the film as a whole.

Psycho is one if not his most revered film. The pacing and the tension grow with each passing minute and for the first time viewer one truly has no idea what to expect, other than the growing feeling that something isn't right. Shocking for its time, and with a twist ending that in this day and age may be easy to figure out but for its time truly took the viewer for a surprise. With a famous score that anyone who hears it will instantly recollect this film. One of the most famous scenes in all of cinema as well, the infamous shower scene. Psycho is a an unsettling film though ages in many aspects still a cinematic treasure that any fan of film can enjoy, as it is in my opinion a timeless classic.  "

One of the finest films of its generation and one in which made Russell Crowe a star. Brilliantly acted and directed with awe inspiring action sequences with weight behind them. The viewer will feel for Crowe's plight within this film, as the pacing and story are top notch. The set pieces as well as the wardrobe and mentality of the film are extremely Roman and feel authentic as anything real in this modern age. A film that was nominated and one in which will not only grip the viewer from beginning to end but resonate with the viewer for some time to come. The action sequence are authentic and very tense as is intended. The musical score is heroic and filled with epic grandeur that only further strengthen the film. Many consider this film an epic and one in which still to this day hold up to the test of time. This film as well was Oliver Reed's last film as he passed away during the filming process. Gladiator is an awe inspiring, swords and sandals film that hold back no punches in its action, its pacing or its storytelling.

After having arrived and conducted a search for survivors the crew returns home only to discover in the most terrifying of ways that a deadly and seemingly invincible bio-form has joined them, and is slowly hunting them one by one. Terrifyingly claustrophobic is a brilliant way to describe this movie. The tension escalates as the movie plays its course. The pacing is brilliant from master filmmaker Ridley Scott. Sigourney Weaver in her most iconic role does a brilliant job portraying Ripley. The feeling of being closed off, the feeling of the Nostromo being a giant claustrophobic maze in which the viewer desperately wishes to escape make this one of the greatest and most terrifying films of its generation. With shocking surprises and twists throughout including the iconic dinner scene that still to this day can be shocking for a first time viewer. The score of the fim only adds to the tension and seemingly silent but deadly tension that continues to mount as the film plays on, only at its conclusion does the viewer finally feel as though they may take a deep breath. Spawning 3 sequels, 2 cross over films, and a loosely tied prequel, Alien has proved to not only resonate these many years later but maintain its popularity within the mytho's of classic American cinema.

This film in this viewers opinions one of Tarantino's best films and matches the wit and charm of his later films. The music of this film follows suit with its intended emotions.

The true spirit of Bruce Wayne and his crime fighting alter ego Batman are captured and displayed by Christian Bale, David S. Goyer and Christopher Nolan. Dark, gritty and realistic make this origin story one of the best in comic book movie history and IMO the greatest of all Batman movies. A perfect mix of action, character development and story help to breath life once again into the iconic character. Set in the sprawling, decayed and ultimately corrupt city of Gotham, tells the story of a child's loss and the man's extraordinary journey in becoming something more than just a man, something more than a tool but a symbol, an ideal and hope in order to perhaps one day cleanse the city of its crime ridden woes that helped create its greatest defender.

Terror and tension run high as the scientists band together to survive but the question remains who is truly who they are and who can be trusted? For its time The Thing was a grotesque and supremely frightening film. Its effects though seemingly aged are still terrifying for those who have not seen or do not know what to expect with this film. The feeling of isolation and suffocation grow with each passing min. of the film. The score of this film compliments that very real feeling of dread and suspense. Kurt Russell one of John Carpenters favorite cast-able actors does a terrific job as R.J. McReady, who seems to be the only one prepared for the terror that is The Thing. The fellow cast mates do a terrific job as well. Though some may argue that the effects have aged and what was once frightening now cheesy, but with a bit of suspended belief one can truly feel and see the films intention, to scare the hell out of you. Graphic and grotesque in its nature, and all done with physical effects which to me resonate a lot of charm and make the film a bit more real than just the standard CGI of today's film making techniques.

One of Spielberg's finest movies, the CGI for its time was astounding and to the first time viewer, jaw dropping. John Williams once again returns to score another Spielberg film and it not only compliments the film but resonates with the viewer long after its viewing. The story, based on the acclaimed novel by Micheal Crichton is fantastic and comes down to the moral question of science versus nature. The acting is great as is the pacing of the film. I hardly ever mention box office success in my reviews as I feel how much money a film makes has no forbearance on the quality of the film, but it must be mentioned that not only is one of the most successful movies of its time, but one that to this day remains one of the all time cinematic adventures of film.

It has been sent to eliminate Sarah Connor, matriarch to the leader of the human resistance, but the resistance has managed to send back a protector for Sarah. Only time will tell who will reach her first.... A fantastic action movie, original in concept and one of Arnold's most iconic roles. The Terminator is fast paced, expertly directed which will entice and suck the viewer in from the first five mins of the film. This film I believe was what launched Arnold into movie stardom as well as Cameron who would both see continued success after this film. The Terminator was far from done as this film would spawn 3 sequels and an eventual fourth in years to come from now. An instant fan favorite, everything about this film is done right, the effects though aged were top notch of the time of its release, the action still gritty and in your face. The story though clich«∏d at certain instances, still has enough originality to make it special and something more than a simple action movie. The score fits perfectly within the mold of the film.

At one point in every persons life they fear whats in the water around them and this film is that reason. Superb acting and pacing that not only terrifies the audience but slowly builds the tension of this film and delivers at its conclusion. The shark is not show for a large portion of the film and for good reason as it helps to build the pay off when it is finally shown. The soundtrack and Jaws theme is one of the most memorable to ever grace a film, and is composed by the master John Williams.

Opening up with a scene of scientists operating on planet Mars, a storm hits the site and as the astronauts make their escape, Matt Damon's botanist, Mark Watney is left behind when hit by flying debris. After this the film shows Mark Watney on Mars all alone and going through what it takes to survive. The film portrays brilliantly a man and his willingness to survive in the face of adversity. The film had some very good parts and despite most things going well (if not too well) you were rooting for Mark Watney to be saved and to make it back to Earth. I think the success of the film was that Matt Damon was very likable as the lead character. Some of the scenes like others have said were a bit cheesy but at the end of the day it is a feel good movie and despite being 2 hours and 21 minutes long there wasn't a moment where I felt bored I thoroughly recommend seeing this film as it is very good.

I studied Rome back at school for 7 years and was very pleased when I heard that they had made a ""sandal and sword"" epic in my time, as opposed to Ben Hur and Spartacus which were made way before me.Having studied Rome for so many years, I had so many images in my head as to what it would have been like. This film turns those images into reality.  Russell Crowe was perfectly cast as the vengeful Maximus. He was really menacing and you could tell that his character had a huge chip on his shoulder (which wasn't surprising since his family had been murdered at the bequest of the Roman emperor, Commodus,, who was now Maximus' enemy). Joaquin Phoenix was great (but a bit hammy!) as the 19 year old emperor. Oliver Reed turned in a sterling performance. This film is a fitting tribute to his memory.  ""Gladiator"" is great entertainment with battle scene after battle scene, wowing you at every turn, dispersed by golden shots of an age-old Rome. You will not be disappointed.   "

So... why only 6/10? I know that black had it hard in times of slavery. Everyone does (at least I hope everyone does). So why I have to watch testament to it in action movie?

44177,tt0816692,Adam Trzcinski,united kingdom,9,Defiantly worth the price of admission,"Leave it to Nolan to confuse his audience, and from his previous work 'Inception' I shouldn't have thought otherwise. And don't forget, before you jump on the bus and head to your nearest cinema, pack your sci-fi helmet because unless you're Brian Cox or some kind of strange child genius you're going to be left in the ""dust"" ( hahahahaha...watch the film... don't leave me laughing by myself) at some points in the movie if you don't focus hard. To begin with I went into the theatre not expecting much, not because I wasn't pumped for the film but because everything was just so damn ambiguous leading up to the ""launch"" ( I am on fire!), which again is a Nolan-ism in itself. But don't be put off by the slight confusion of the movies basic plot in the trailers as that is what makes this movie so special, you think it's going one way from the advertising but then you leave the room blown out of the water by the complex and detailed story that wasn't even hinted at in the previews. And boy was there a complex storyline, it's the kind of narrative that leaves you thinking which is rare in today's Hollywood, and it truly does deliver on the thought provoking subjects, so if you're looking for a philosophical debate this it just the ticket for you and your friends. Now onto the acting, I'm not going to beat around the bush on this one so I'll just come out and say it... Is there anything that McConaughey can't do! Seriously he's a star (yeah! OK, I'll stop) and delivers on just about everything you would want. There's just something special about seeing my child hood dream of floating about in space and (one of) my favourite actor together that just gets me so giddy. Anne Hathaway also surprised me highly. From the trailers I saw only a tiny bit of her but she was actually a main character which made me smile, not only was she a really good spaceman and good co-pilot but I just really like the look of her, she pulls off business, daredevil, astronaut, brave-heart and pioneer all in one film whilst sporting that short hair that I just love so much. Nolan's star child, Michael Cain also got more screen time than usual which was a nice treat as he was just really good at playing an old man. Jessica Chastain is a new 'fav' of mine, I was actually surprised of how well they played off the ageing characters because they genuinely looked quite similar to their other actors, kudos to the casting directors! For a movie with such beautiful cinematography there is only one thing that could make it better, a beautiful soundtrack, and it certainly delivered on that front! Hans Zimmer has outdone himself once more on this score, it fits so perfectly with the vastness of the movie's universe and when the action drops, you can assure yourself the beat does too. In conclusion, if it's a spectacle you want, and a topic of debate you need then this film sure does deliver! If you enjoyed Inception or gravity, heck, even if you enjoyed beauty and the beast, this film is made for you! Go and see it, it's defiantly worth the price of admission. 9.7 out of 10  "
104197,tt0120735,Adam Villani,united states,3,Irritating and witless," Guy Ritchie has gone beyond mere Tarantino imitation and found his own unique voice in crime pictures, but unfortunately it's an irritating, witless, virulent voice. Sure, this movie is colorful and snazzy, but I think everyone gets snookered by the British accents and machine-gun delivery of the lines to realize that nobody says anything remotely intelligent. A lot of British humor is very good, but there's also a tendency to just have everyone be mean and nasty to each other and pretend that that's somehow the pinnacle of wit. Don't mistake flash for substance.  "
54933,tt0172495,Adam White,united kingdom,8,Four years on and still as strong," Upon release this film set the world on fire. It was an amazing achievement. Four years on and it has lost some of its original charm but most of what made it great still remains. Russell Crowe deserves to be a superstar based on this performance alone. He controls the screen with such ease he was destined for good things from this moment onwards. This film also kick-started Ridley Scott's second career high which is a good thing for the movie world as he can be one of the best directors when he wants to be. The score by Hans Zimmer is as amazing as usual, I can't recall the man creating a bad soundtrack for a movie. Now for the downside. The film is only really good when Crowe is on screen. Joaquin Phoenix put in an amazing performance as the new Emperor but that didn't help the scenes in Rome from being very boring. I also can't help but cringe at the ending, only because watching the slaves walk out into the coliseum and stand around while Connie Neilsen badly acts being sad was a terrible way to end such a good film. 8/10  "
140412,tt0075148,Adam Whiteley,united kingdom,9,"Better the second time around, by miles!!","I never for one second appreciated the first time i watched the first Rocky movie. Being about 8, i actually didn't even know who won the first fight between creed and balboa, i'd paid that little attention to it. being told of course over and over that ""the first is always the best"", ""huh, yeh right"" i thought. I'd expected it to be like rocky 3 or 4, but better. They were the films id grown up watching first off as a kid and loved them! The all action blow outs, with big hitting rounds of straight to the point boxing. At the time i felt it to be just too long, too boring and just so action less in comparison, and lets be honest, action as a kid is what we all wanted! I then eventually got to wait up late one evening and watch number 2, so basically i watched them all over the place in terms of order. However, much further down the line in my life, i watched Rocky for the first time in about 16 years, nothing els on, i had nothing to do, so i just sat and watched it. By the end of the film, having wiped a tear i might add too, being much older, and much more appreciative of life in general, of course having now gone through some of the difficult riggors of growing up and seeing first hand what life can throw at us, i was completely touched and blown away by the overall relevance of this film, i no longer found it boring, old school, too long or action less, but was actually taken in and enchanted by the whole story, not to mention you get the first true glimpse of that famous music and feel good factor that the whole rocky saga brought to us all. The fact i understood what was actually going on this time made an over riding contribution to me loving and really appreciating the story of the film. I guess one of the biggest regrets i have thus far was watching this saga half way through first off, missing the first films out and watching them all in stupid order. I look back now and so wish i'd never watched the 3rd and 4th instalments first, but i guess for one reason or another that cant be helped as a kid, i mean mum and dad do what ever it takes to keep us happy as kids right? haha! So Having carried the opinion that the first rocky wasn't all that good kinda makes me sad i thought that now. All in all i rate this film as one of the all time greats, deserving of its classic status and subsequent Oscar nominations and actual winning of Oscar awards, along with many other awards down the years, and of course the citical acclaim it received. As an 8 year old, i never knew i was watching something that never actually set out to be ""all action blow-outs"" but in fact inspirational, something that changed millions of lives, a hope giving and eye opening movie, something that was about to set millions of people on a jurney through life to get what they always dreamed of, and in fact sending that message across the globe that if u do want something, if u want to achieve, grab that life changing dream with both hands and is do-able, of course you can do it. Of course, it is only a film, but what this film did was inspire. A way to sum it up? a story of the unknown bum given a 1 in a million shot at the WBC belt, living the life of a small time club fighter, to eventual 2 time and multi defending WBC heavyweight champion of the world, a dream nearly every little boy had, I know i did.

96966,tt0363163,Adam Whyte (charteredstreets@hotmail.com),united kingdom,9,"Chilling, insightful, and stunning - Ganz is truly amazing","Robert Altman once said that if every movie were like its trailer, every movie would be exactly the same. The TV ads for Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Downfall,"" starring Bruno Ganz as Hitler, are making it look like an action war movie about heroes and villains. There are a handful of explosions in the movie, and all of them are in that ad ∂? and little else. Those expecting violence and a neatly packaged message may be disappointed, or perhaps, like me, surprised by the movie's insights, depths and power. The movie does, certainly, have scenes of carnage and battle ∂? how could a movie set in Berlin in the last days of World War II not? ∂? but the majority of the story unfolds in the claustrophobic rooms and corridors of Hitler's bunker. The movie follows the stories of Hitler, Eva Braun, Traudl Junge, Hitler's private secretary, and a doctor whose conscience gets the better of him. Hitler has been represented in countless other movies, and he is usually shown as a caricature of evil, or a mocking imitation (most famously in Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator""). Ganz's performance surpasses them all; it surpasses imitation, and he presents Hitler as human, as a paradox, as a man affected by both evil and madness. There is a pre-title scene where he stands upright in his early days in power, as he hires a secretary. He has a certain charm over women and, later, we see the way that children, too, adore him; 'Uncle Hitler,' they call him. Later, as the end of the war looms, we see the cruel way he presides over his maps and diagrams, ordering troops into certain death. He is so cut-off from humanity that his view is that if Berlin falls, its inhabitants do not deserve to live. His back becomes hunched as he barks out orders, his hands darting in all directions; its astonishing to consider that this is the same actor who was so serene and introverted in Wim Wender's ""Wings of Desire."" The two main criticisms I have heard made of ""Downfall"" are that it is not historically accurate, and that Hitler becomes too human; too sympathetic. ""Downfall"" may not include all the facts, but it is not propaganda; it has no political motives or agenda. Its motives are to help the audience question situations and events that are beyond the grasp of most modern people's understanding. Movies are not the medium for fact; the truth of ""Downfall"" is in the way it sums up the conflicting feelings of a deceived and confused people. What would have been wrong and 'inaccurate' would be to deny the fact that Hitler was a person, and not just an evil force, like something from a comic book. I'm not trying to say he was not an evil person; just that an evil person is still a person. Yes, it is a 'troubling' movie, as Stanley Kauffman pointed out in his review. How could it not be? What use would a movie which showed Hitler as lacking humanity have? What interest would it have? The movie is being criticised where it should be praised; it does not manipulate the audience, or tell you how to feel. That's where its power comes from. Watching the real Traudl Junge at the movie's end, I had tears in my eyes. It's difficult to say what is so moving about the film. When Hitler dies, we do not sympathise with him; in fact we feel a certain relief, because it means the end is in sight. His way out was an easy one, but the others had to live the rest of their lives with a burden on their conscience. Traudl Junge liked Hitler as a person, and that was her own downfall.  "
142753,tt1201607,Adam Wiley,united states,7,Disappointing,"I am a Potterhead. I love the books and I love all the movies, scratch that I love most of the movies. I knew there would be changes in the movie, there always is, but I couldn't stand the changes that were made. There are spoilers ahead, but if you read the book, it shouldn't spoil anything. I am going to list the things I disliked. 1. MASSIVE SPOILER. The ending fight sequence has to be the most disappointing thing in the movie. Especially the final fight. I was very shocked when Harry grabs Voldemort and dives off the ledge. That part was beyond corny. It was out of place. When Harry and Voldemort final duel, it was not very impressive. Voldemort's death was a disgrace to the book and the character. I will not spoil how in dies in the movie. END OF SPOILER. 2. Neville had too many lines. The character was written very poorly for the script. 3. BIG SPOILER. The deaths of Lupin, Fred, Tonks, were very poorly done. We have no time to grieve for the losses of those characters. We just get a quick shot of there bodies, then back to Harry. I know I will not be the only Harry Potter fan upset at the way the deaths were handled. My mom, who didn't even read the book, didn't notice that Lupin and Tonks were dead. Lupin was my favorite Potter characters, I am maddened at the way they handled his death. END SPOILER 4. MINOR SPOILER. At the end of the movie, Harry snaps the elder wand. You can't snap the most powerful wand in the world, I was confused and slightly upset at this. END SPOILER. The things I liked about the movie, there are some spoilers ahead. Like before if you read the book, nothing should be spoiled. 1. HUGE SPOILER. Snape's memories where very well done. I teared up a little during it.. END SPOILER. 2. The acting was superb! I agree with most people on the board, Alan Rickman deserves an Oscar nomination for his role as professor Snape. Ralph Fiennes was amazing as Voldemort. The casting was perfect for every single character. 3. The CG was good enough. You could tell they spent more attention to the Dragon and spells than other things, but other than that is was very believable. 4. The humor wasn't overdone. It came at the perfect moment in the movie. 5. The direction wasn't great, but it wasn't bad enough for me to dislike it. It felt like David Yates paid more attention to part 1 of the Deathly Hallows than part 2. If you haven't read the book you should like the movie. This is my least favorite Harry Potter movie. While some people say it was the perfect way to end the series, I disagree. It could have been more better if there was a different script writer and different director. But this has to do since this is the last Harry Potter movie we will ever see, right?  "

The acting in this movies is so strong and really pushes it over the edge of greatness. The screenplay is phenomenal with nothing seeming out of place and everything fitting perfectly together in one solid piece. Who knew that a film set in a mental institute could be so uplifting? This film is well deserving of 'The Big Five' Oscar wins it received. Jack Nicholson really goes above and beyond with his performance, providing a character that no one can dislike. There is really nothing I don't like about this film and that is why I've given it a solid 9 out of 10! If you have not seen this film I highly recommend it for your next watch.  "
155836,tt2015381,Adam Woolston,united states,6,Did I miss something?,"Everyone said this movie was fantastic. As a big superhero and Marvel fan, I obviously went and saw it. I'm not so sure I saw the same movie as everyone else who loved it. I'll start with the exposition. Peter Quill, a young boy on Earth witnesses his mother die. OK. This was clearly supposed to make me sad. Let's face it, though, every superhero has lost one or both parents. Plus,I didn't know anything about this character so it was hard for me to care about him. It was supposed to be dramatic and intense, but it was just a big pile of meh. But that's OK! Because now we get into the meat of the story. Peter is all grown up and played by Chris Pratt and he's... a thief? OK. I can cheer for thieves, I guess. I like the Italian Job. But I'm a little confused that the other thief (Some blue alien whose name I forget two seconds after they say it) who was his partner and got ripped off is not supposed to be cheered for. He doesn't seem much worse than Quill to me. What, we hate him because he is blue? Oh, sure, he turns out a lot worse at the end, but come on. Up until that point the protagonist is just as bad, if not worse, than him. Speaking of questionable morals, how about Bradley Cooper's Rocket? Only motivated by money. He's only on the good guy team because he can make a truckload of cash. I struggled to cheer for him. Also, I am a huge Batista fan, and was excited to see him in this one. Disappointed. His character has no reason to be there. He doesn't contribute anything to the story except make things harder for everyone else and get his butt kicked a few times. I was hoping the WWE star would show us his physical prowess by actually WINNING a fight here and there. The only physical prowess he shows is LOOKING really big and intimidating. Speaking of looks, this movie is very pretty. I will concede that. Excellent CGI. But in today's age of Avatar and Gravity, I just can't be impressed too much by CGI anymore. It doesn't have the same effect in the modern age of movies. Overall, this movie is OK. It holds up with other Marvel titles and I'm sure as the characters are explored a little more, I'll find more joy in it. But frankly, I was pumped for this movie and let down. And I really TRIED to enjoy. I found myself forcing myself to laugh at Bradley Cooper's remarks and attempting to feel sorry for the tragedies the various characters went through, but I really just couldn't care about the characters. I don't know these people. They aren't Iron Man, Hulk, or Captain America. They are... Starlord, Queen Ghidorah(?), Raccoon dude, Groot (You are forced to remember that one), and unintelligent beefcake alien. They don't fight Loki, they fight some cowboy alien and some blue dude with an infinity stone (OK...). Thanos is there too. He's also important. I guess. Meh.  "

The acting is top notch throughout by everyone on screen and as serious as this film is it ihas some brilliant one liners which will have you laughing out loud. Eastwood plays a ex war veteran who's wife dies and he is left alone to cope with his Hmong neighbours. As racist and prejudiced as he is he comes to like and respect these people he used to kill in the war, and although he seems beyond his best in regards to his age he shows the Hmong gang bangers who is boss. That is all I will say on this movie as anything more will spoil it, but definitely worth the watch. Hope This Helps.  "

Outside of the first 15 minutes, which truly are incredible, the movie is unoriginal and unconvincing. I never felt that the really was a good reason for going after Private Bleached-teeth. The tank battle towards the end was pretty good but for real wartime horror check out the German STALINGRAD. And as far as incredible WWII films go, you simply can't live without having seen DAS BOOT.   "
109349,tt0434409,adam zerda,united states,6,"Interesting movie whose story, unfortunately, hinges on a few ridiculous assumptions","V for Vendetta is an interesting movie. The story unfolds slowly, setting up the main characters, their back story and the setting very well. It introduces connections to Guy Fawkes, the Count of Monte Cristo and more recent fair such as ""1984"". The relationship between V and Evey develops slowly as V plots his revolution, convincingly showing how someone might be torn between the goal of the revolution and the means to achieve it. Halfway through, however, as V's deadline approaches, the movie takes a ludicrous turn. Evey's character changes abruptly. This change, as near as I can tell, is made only to move the plot (both movie and V's) along. Although we are shown the reasons for this change of personality, to me it rang hollow and the story suffers as a result. ""V"" is an interesting movie to watch and to reflect on given today's reality. There are numerous connections to the present that the filmmakers obviously wanted to exploit. The means to that end, however, are distorted by some plot twists that I, personally, found unconvincing.  "
15939,tt0167260,Adam Zybez,canada,1,An absolute dud in the world of movies,"Holy Smokes, this has got to be one of the most pointless trilogies I've ever seen. I do not even know how it scored this high, there was nothing that made it stand out at all. Throughout the 9 excruciating hours of watching Frodo turn into a mentally disoriented fool, I cannot recount a single moment in time where I said, ""Wow, that's interesting."" First off, the plot is simply unenjoyable; it has no twist, no character building and for god's sake, its about a possessive ring. Watching the characters go through pointless trials to burn a single ring is not something i can find appealing. In fact I was ready to watch any of these uptight Hobbits meet their end. That is a huge problem in this series, not one character was tragically killed in the midst of any orc battle. OK, there was that no-name in the Fellowship of the Ring, but the audience didn't give a damn as to what was going on with him. What made me even more angry was that these fools looked almost invincible. When Legolas and Gimli were slaying orcs left and right as easily as brushing snowflakes away I was ready to step out of the theater. I can see why people liked this movie. The action was indeed thrilling and had great deal of special effects thrown into it. I remember Legolas' first arrow being launched smoothly into an orc, what a marvelous scene. Then I looked and he was launching another arrow in a similar fashion, then another one, and another one! Sure it looked great, but it was so repetitive I got bored. Every battle in this movie is almost exactly the same: swords swinging, arrows launching, and people screaming, I just can't see what was so special about it. I also could not get through my head the final battle scene. Honestly an army of the undead destroying the orc forces, gee that must have been a difficult victory. It was so predictable and unfair I simply hated this movie. For all of the action attempts and turning a really old trilogy into a movie, I was considering giving this film two stars, but then I remembered the conclusion. Frodo and Sam were being saved by a bunch of hawks or something and everything seemed to be at peace - not a bad ending. Then the story stretches into farewells and goodbyes, good luck and god bless - OK I can tolerate this. Now Bilbo is going into a boat and heading off to god knows where - When is this bloody movie going to end? By the time I got out of the theater it was nearly half an hour after the part where the movie would have made an effective conclusion, my behind sweating like an oxen from boredom. I would definitely not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you are amazed by a couple of special effects. I don't know how this movie did so well, I think one critic said it was a good movie and it spread like wildfire or maybe there was simply nothing else to do but worship elves. Whatever the reason, I do not want to see this ever again!  "

I first saw this book on Google Play as a new read. The idea sold me 100% and I downloaded instantly. I was on deployment at the time for 7 months so I did a lot of reading on my down time. Let me just say this. I could not put the book down and I couldn't read it fast enough. It was that good!!! I was even more excited when I saw that the movie got a green light. OK, the movie. Obviously, it would be impossible to cram every bit of detail from the book into the movie. But the film adaption was great. I did feel like as an audience member that we (the viewers) were just along for the ride. We were being shuttled from one event to the next. There was key things missing from the movie that explained a lot of the decisions the main character was making. Overall, great movie, better book. You should watch this and then read it after.

For the others, it's a misunderstood drawn out period piece that is painfully painfully too long. I'd like to think that 1975's Barry Lyndon is the envy of dedicated film makers, the perfect portrayal of a rouge young Irishman who's opportunistic, fortune seeking destiny end's in inevitable misery. Although this film isn't thought of as Kubrick's most experimental, it is definitely his most polished, picturesque and quite possibly analyzed. I've watched this film several times over the last 10 years and I still really enjoy it, I'm glad that its grown in stature over the last few years...that's the true indication of a film, not the box office takings.

Now the idea of a fantastic film for me is one where u get totally drawn in and so immersed in the film yet I believed that i wouldn't be able to do this if i was having to read to understand the plot. I couldn't of been any further incorrect. This film is amazing. The plot, the shots, the camera, the direction, the script, the acting absolutely everything about this film is very very impressive and from a media student point of view the editing was of such a high standard that i personally hadn't witnessed before. I agree totally that the film is shocking violent and brutal yet i think anything less and this wouldn't of been the film that it is. The shock factor is only a shock to us as we don't experience situations like this, yet in the setting from which the film is shot from it is common everyday practise. I think one of the most successful aspects of this film is the fact that it sticks true fully to what life really is like in the Brazilian slums, the temptation is clearly there for over exaggerated crimes and police chases yet the temptation is not pursued. All in all i think that this is a truly fantastic movie and one which en captures its audience and forces you to take notice. If you haven't watched this film do so and if u have watched this film watch it again its just as amazing second time over. Ad  "
145958,tt0073195,adam_wud,united kingdom,10,Captivating........ in one hell of a scary way," When i was about 9 i bought this film solely for the purpose that is was a popular film. I sat down and watched it excepting a typical horror movie, ala nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th. Instead i got so much more then that. For anyone who calls themselves a movie collector who hasn't seen JAWS i advise you to get it. The opening sequence when Chrissie Watkins gets killed is cinema magic. Then shark is never shown yet it gives us an uneasy feeling of ""what if?"". What if we had of seen the shark? what gore is it unleashing on this poor girl? If they had of showed it, there is no way that the scene would have been as scary. Instead Spielberg gives us he IMPRESSION of what is happening. Alex Kintner's death is much the same. We see blood although we do NOT see violence. Our imagination is much worse then the actual truth. Then the Orca scenes The bad chemistry that is going between Hooper and Quint is very obvious. Then you have Brody who is the common man. He earns a common salary, being the police chief of a common town with a common wife and common kids. He is US!!. The average person. He has fears, he has family he has a connection to us. His flash of courage in the ending is very uncommon. When Brody breaks the style from ordinary man to extraordinary man is the key to the movie. It ends up as a monster battling (in the end) an ordinary man. The movie of JAWS is not only a definitive point of Steven Spielberg, but the entire horror genre. The thought of being killed when you went swimming is unimaginable... until JAWS. After that film people are, and still are today, scared of swimming because of this movie. If a film of this magnitude has this effect on so many people, then there is no question that you have to see it. **** 1/2   "

It's the cliched story of a poor brother and sister who have to get by with one pair of beat-up old shoes between them. Direct references to Bicycle Thieves abound. Samira Makhmalbaf's The Apple, one of the greatest films of modern cinema, is still unavailable on video and has been seen by almost no one in the states. Until Kiarostami won the Palme D'Or for Taste of Cherry, his films were only seen by a handful of lucky individuals who made it to the right film festivals. Samira's father, Mohsen Makhmalbaf, whose films make it to theaters but never with too much attention, and other great artists like Bahram Bayzai and Daryush Mehrju'i, are overshadowed in America, somehow, by Majidi. Despite having made what might be the most significant Iranian film in history, The Cow - shown at Venice in the early 70's and introducing the country's cinema to the world - Mehrju'i and Bayzai - considered to be their best by the Iranians themselves - collectively have fewer films available on video than does Majidi, in his relatively young career. Children of Heaven is the only Iranian film that I have seen which seems artificial. The performances are not good, the plot seems hackneyed and contrived, and it's sentimental - there's lot of crying and yelling. The children aren't real people, but little angels beset upon by this harsh life. The little boy hero is even the best student in his class AND a great athlete. Jafar Panahi's The White Balloon and Abbas Kiarostami's Where Is The Friend's Home are both very similar storywise, but infinitely more touching, substantial and genuine.   "

My good friend out in Los Angeles is an actor and he and his scene partner acted out the scene of Jules and Vincent driving around town and having a discussion about Vincent's recent travels abroad. And the writing was just amazing how the writer tied everything together so perfectly. And I think that it's the dialogue that drives the movie and makes it such high quality. Everything from the ""gold watch"" speech to Harvey Keitel's dialogue. Quentin always seems to find a way to make the something horrific quite humorous without ever seeming to ask for a laugh.

Ever!," I have been a fan of both Kubrick and Clarke for many years now, but I had always avoided watching this movie because I couldn't see how it could possibly match the brilliance of the novel (Which is one of my most loved books). However, after finally seeing it, I am happy. no ecstatic. to say that it didn't match the novel, it surpassed it! Kubrick did an amazing job of keeping in the deep profound meaning of the story, which is really what makes this movie so great in my opinion. It puts forward theories and asks questions which not only entertain, but make you want to think and discuss, for a long time after you have seen the movie. The shear grand scope of the subject matter in my opinion makes almost all other movies pale into insignificance. What could be more profound than a story about the very existence of our race, and its position and meaning in the universe? The effects in this movie are amazing; not in a `3D generated CGI wiz-bang eye candy' type of way, but in a far more mature way. The purpose of them is to portray a scene in the most realistic way possible, and in my opinion by doing so, they work much more effectively than any movie made in more modern times, with greater effects technology and budget. I was completely amazed that this movie was filmed all those years ago in 1968. People who are after a movie that provides light entertainment value and does not require much thought or patience would do well to avoid 2001: A Space Odyssey. However for those who are after a deep and rich movie experience, and are willing to put in the work (in terms of patience and thought) will be greatly rewarded. The meaning of this movie is most definitely not served up to the viewer on a silver platter, and you may have to watch it a few times, or discuss it with others before you truly understand it. Everyone's interpretation of it may be different. That's what makes it so thought-provoking.   "

Another huge surprise for me was Leonardo Di Caprio - thoughts about his role before watching the film I felt I was going to be very disappointed. But I really do feel he deserves an Oscar for this.

You have a old, racist, Korean War veteran struggling to adjust to a neighborhood that has, over time, come to be filled with foreigners. And its not just any old man, either... Its Clint Eastwood. You know what your getting with Eastwood as an actor at this stage of his career - a tired old man with a grizzly voice to match those gritted teeth. The 4 time Oscar winner fit the role perfectly - despite this fact however, the question is ""why did he even take on this project?"" The cringingly bad script should have been enough for Eastwood to pass this one up. First of all, this was Nick Schneck's first attempt at anything big. I love to see a young writer emerge on the scene with a genius screenplay, but this guy just plain failed. I'm not sure if he was trying to be ""real"", but the result was a movie full of sloppy, heavy-handed lines. Add a weak supporting cast to the mix, and you've got a complete dud that revolves around the big-named Eastwood. Regardless of any storyline or actors involved in a film, you generally expect Eastwood to put together, at the very least, a good, solid movie. This is not the case with Gran Torino. While Eastwood did turn in a solid performance, his direction of this movie, plague from the start with bad lines, was uncharacteristically shoddy. Watching the movie, I had a hard time believing this is the same director that gave us Mystic River, and Unforgiven. I guess even the best directors make a clunker every now and then. Having watched movies such as this one, Changeling, and Flags of Our Fathers, I have also come to realize that Mr. Eastwood just can't resist a good clich«∏ now and then. Watching Changeling, I just put my hand over my face when Angelina Jolie says ""hope"" at the ending. If you saw Changeling you know what I mean. I was disappointed with Gran Torino.

One of the most popular screen Westerns ever made, this Academy Award -winning classic blends adventure, romance and comedy to tell the true story of the West's most likable outlaws. No-one is quicker than Butch Cassidy (Newman) when it comes to get rich quick schemes , and his sidekick Sundance (Redford) is a wizard with a gun. When these two bungling bank and train robbers tire of running from the law, they set out for Bolivia with Sundance's girlfriend (Katherine Ross). Though they can barely speak enough Spanish to communicate: ""This is a stickup!"", thats only a minor detail to the nicest ""bad guys"" who ever rode the West.  "
108885,tt0434409,adam-621,united kingdom,6,Disappointing,"Did anyone catch the premiere programme on ITV? To me, none of the actors interviewed seemed particularly enthusiastic about the film. Perhaps it was because they had been interviewed so many times that day or the fact the interviewer was so dull. Coupled with the appalling mini-trailers shown on television - things blows up, so what? - I couldn't have been less eager to see V for Vendetta. Note: the only decent trailer is Trailer 2 on the movie's website. For the most part, the movie is far too wordy, which is probably why it drags. I kept thinking ""Come on, get on with it."" In my opinion, the editing was poor and I found myself getting very irritated with it. I was disappointed by Stephen Rea, who I think is a great actor, but he just sounded so bored with it all. The only actor who seemed to work was Stephen Fry. As for the mask thing, it was a shame that V couldn't have been less burned so that he could have worn a partial mask because, try as he might, Hugo Weaving could not act effectively through it. To give Mr Weaving his dues, it would have been nigh on impossible for any top actor. This genre is not really my sort of thing but it was, all in all, a good film. I wish I didn't have such negative feelings about it. With its predecessors, the awful Matrix Trilogy, this could have been much worse.  "

This movie deals with several hot button issues, such as racial and religious discrimination (specially post 9-11) terrorism versus freedom fighters, and the trade off of personal freedom for safety. Naturally, there are slight exaggerations , but once you think about it, its not really that big of a stretch, seeing where we are heading and the latest political news. The action scenes were entertaining, with some nice cinematography. I had never heard of the comic books, yet the story managed to draw me in.

126019,tt0469494,AdamantiumMunky,united kingdom,2,There might be blood eventually,"I have never written a review on IMDb before. I consider myself a well rounded movie fan, if perhaps a product of my generation (i'm 28). I like movies like No Country for Old Men and Schindlers list but I also enjoy Arnie and Star Wars. There Will Be Blood annoyed me so much I felt the need to write a review. I went into There Will Be Blood not knowing much, I knew it was about greed and oil, it had Daniel Day Lewis, and good reviews. I foolishly thought that it would have more of a frontier/western feel to it with a power struggle that maybe ended with a gun fight, but that's my own fault for not doing my research and not the movies.I won't go over the plot or story as many others have already. What I liked was DDL and seeing the 1900s oil drilling etc, but thats honestly about it. What I didn't like was the title's promise of 'blood', now i'm not expecting a horror and I don't hold the opinion of blood making a good film, what I mean is that the title suggests a ramping up of tension and violence that is A) intrinsic to the plot and B)a major theme. It is neither, yes there WILL be blood but you're going to have to sit through 2+ hours of boring fixed camera angles, pointless horror movie music (cut over scenes of walking around or hammering posts), a confusing cast choice where one guy plays two people (I thought this was for plot reasons, but no its just because one actor backed out and casting couldn't be bothered to find another actor), a main character whose motivations and personality are a mystery (but not in an interesting mysterious way). I was expecting the tension to build and build, even toward the last 40 mins I thought it was going to happen, but it doesn't, as I said above they employ music that suggests impending violence or catastrophe, but this never matches up with what we're seeing (a montage of dull activities) and then dies as randomly as it is starts. There are accidents and a bit of random violence in the middle but it will leave you questioning why its there. DDL tells his 'brother' that he is essentially a bitter angry man who hates everyone else and by default is slightly mental...which is weird because that wasn't brought to our attention in the first hour and a half and I was under the impression that he was just a successful hard working man who loved his adopted son. Yes he's going to be a little money grabbing but then we wouldn't expect anything else from someone in the oil business would we? To suddenly reveal his mental state or in fact his personality disorder that far in the movie in a casual conversation seems like they realised they had written a boring movie and in order to change gears they decided he would be a little bit mental. This results in not caring about what happens to him. If his dark side was countered by the priest whose angelic mission to build his church and save DDL from his selfish ways was the yang to DDLs Ying then it would be a balanced struggle of wills perhaps. However the priest is just as shallow and see through as Daniel so we're left with a bit of tension between two unlikable guys whose odd power struggle doesn't really have a source or a reason to it. A very convoluted, overly long, boring, and confusing movie that is neither clever or artistic.  "

131802,tt1392190,adamarket-248-37143,united states,8,High Octane Action - The Best Apology for Thunderdome Miller Could Ever Make,"Mad Max 4 should be titled: Apologies for Thunderdome. While the third movie wasn't completely awful, it diluted the power of the American titled ""Road Warrior"" or as we called it in England where I first saw it, ""Mad Max 2"". By the time the third movie came along in 1985, I could actually see the damn film without somebody telling us it was a ""video nasty"" and something we shouldn't see. Fast forward 20 years to 2015 and a massive marketing campaign for Mad Max: Fury Road. First thought - thank you George Miller for this movie, it's as good as an apology for Thunderdome as I could hope for. Do I like the movie as much as the pinnacle of the series, Road Warrior? I do not. Why? Max isn't so much as maximus as minimus to Charlize Theron's Imperator Fursiosa. She's the *real* hero of this movie. Max plays a supporting role, and you know, maybe that's OK. First off, despite being an action movie, this is an adult's movie. It feels more like a 70's movie with adult themes, reactions and action than EVERY other action movie this year. It's a testament to this film that I watched every trailer BEFORE the movie minus the hopeful Ant- Man and thought, ""There's no way I'm watching that sh***y movie"". The best movie this year is 'It Follows', but guess what? Mad Max: Fury Road is a solid #2. Things I love. The plot has no story arcs. It's like a Japanese Kurosawa movie. Max and a bunch of ladies have to escape an evil daddy figure and that's it. Simple set up then ... action. What follows is all logical minus the way Max gets kicked up onto another vehicle to help save the day. People die when you don't expect them too. Not because you want it or it's appropriate, just because, s*** happens. I loved the non-calculatedness of Mad Max. Max isn't the hero you've been looking for. Furiosa is. The mission is righteous, but geez, this is an imagined and detailed world where barely anything makes sense. My favorite thing was how a bad brainless goon becomes the ultimate self-sacrificing hero without it feeling forced. That's good movie making. In conclusion, American audiences don't often see this kind of movie. It doesn't follow format. It's exactly why Avengers: Age of Ultron failed. Joss Whedon is super talented but he was *contained* by rules of his own making. George Miller has NONE. He made a movie about a sometimes great, sometimes victimized called Max who helps a truly heroic and hopeful being called Furiosa make the world just a little less shitty. For the authenticity and trueness of the story and acting, I give this movie a high 8/10.  "

8018,tt0468569,adamassacre,united states,9,My UNBIASED Opinion,"Don't stop reading this after the first sentence. I have an opinion that NEEDS to be voiced. I've been waiting for film critics to release a review of The Dark Knight that didn't include the words ""Rest In Peace""... not that that's bad, but I believe that there is a time and place for something like that- an honest film review is, in my opinion, neither the time nor place.. (And I don't know about you, but when I heard that Ledger's performance was Oscar-worthy, I immediately thought that it was going to be over-hyped) That being said, Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was, above everything else, CONVINCING. Before this year is over, you'll hear words describing Heath's performance as ""Brilliant, perfect, unmatched, stellar, chilling, etc."" but the reason everyone of those words are true is because Heath Ledger was BELIEVABLE as The Joker. Sure, everyone else in the movie did a fantastic job, but I just wanted to settle that score for everybody who may think that this movie is being over-hyped because of the death of Heath Ledger. I think the best example of what I'm trying to say is... If Daniel Day-Lewis died after There Will Be Blood was completed, it would still be a magnificent job of acting. Not because he died and everybody feels the need to commemorate him, but because he did his job well. The Dark Knight was, in my opinion, Christopher Nolan's best film to date- excluding Memento, but that isn't even fair since it's not even in the same genre as The Dark Knight. Go see this, I promise you won't be let down. -Adam "
126162,tt0469494,adamassacre,united states,10,I can't give enough praise.,"The first thing about 'There Will Be Blood' that hooked me was the acting. I think that Daniel Day Lewis gave the best performance of his career- with the only competition being 'My Left Foot' and 'Gangs of New York'. Everybody's talking about the stellar performance that he delivers, but the thing that shocks me is that NOBODY (at least nobody I know) has said anything about Paul Dano. In my opinion, his performance surprised the hell out of me. He didn't have much acting to do in Little Miss Sunshine, seeing as he was a mute for 3/4 of the film. His acting was really dynamic. Totally surprised me. P.T. Anderson does an incredible job directing. The thing that really appealed to me was the symmetry involved in the majority of the shots in the film. He seemed to use a lot of symmetry in 'Punch Drunk Love', but not as much in 'Hard Eight' 'Boogie Nights' or 'Magnolia'. Lighting, contrast, and the overall tone of the film was VERY visually appealing. P.T. also did a great job with the screenplay- which I now own. And although a lot of what happens in TWBB doesn't stay true to the book 'Oil!', he definitely makes it his own- which is hard to do without ruining the film altogether. I'm a huge Radiohead and Jonny Greenwood fan, and I loved the soundtrack. The majority of reviews that I hear say that the music was inappropriately used at times, but I think that although there was nothing tense going on on the screen, the music was used to show the darkness/depravity of the situation. Then again, I'm really biased. I've seen every other film nominated for Best Picture, and I really think this should win. If neither this nor 'No Country For Old Men' doesn't win, then I'll be really disappointed. I don't think any other movie nominated for Best Picture even deserves to be in the same group as these two movies. One last thing- the one thing that kept running through my head was, ""... there's no way this isn't going to be considered a classic forty years from now."" The dialogue is so memorable and perfect that I still remember MANY lines and how perfectly they were delivered by each actor. I can't say enough good things about this film. I've seen it twice, and I'll see it many more times. Please see this movie... really.  "

118791,tt2488496,adamb-00861,united states,8,Good Movie Overall With a Few Flaws!!!,"First of all I will list the positives of this film and then the negatives. -Kylo Ren is a total bada**. Ren is sinister, angry, yet displays his calmer emotional side in a few scenes of the movie. I liked how they gave him an inner conflict to deal with having to kill Han Solo his father. Ultimately Ren is seduced fully by the dark side by killing his father. Kylo Ren is a great villain with a long story left to be told. Also Adam Driver did a great job performing the character. - I liked the Darth Vader homage. It felt to me that Kylo Ren had no idea that Vader actually was redeemed as Anakin Skywalker before he died. Could this have played a part in his corruption by Snoke? -Daisy Ridleys Rey is a good addition to the franchise. I really loved how in the trailers it showed Finn wielding the lightsabers instead of Rey only to find out in the movie she is the force sensitive character. Once again Ridley did a very good job with her performance. - The Supreme Commander Snoke storyline was interesting and I look forward to more information on him. -Han Solo's death has been very controversial with many saying he should have died fighting or sacrificing his life to save the others. I thought this was an extremely bittersweet scene because it is sad to see Han go but it really showcased how far Kylo Ren ""Ben Solo"" had to fall in order to murder his own father. Han touching Ben's face right before he died was extremely touching and really portrayed that Han loved his son even though he had killed him. =( -The special effects were good with good mix of CGI and practical effects. JJ kept the lens flares to a minimum though they did show up here and there. - Harrison Fords performance was great. - Poe Dameron was a great addition to the story. Reminded me of Wedge from the original movies just with more swag, moves, and charisma. His story will be an interesting one I am sure. - I liked BB8, he gave some good laughs - One Word ""Chewbacca"" - The last scene with Luke was chilling. Negatives: - I liked how John Boyega portrayed Finn but don't really understand why he is in this movie. His character just kinda ran around for 2+ hours. He's not a Jedi or a pilot so I really hope they give Finn a more complex and in depth storyline in the next film. - This movie definitely pays homage to the Original Star Wars: A New Hope. The final battle was pretty much death star 3.0 just not as cool and was lacking a bit. - In a certain line C3PO says ""Without the Republic Fleet Were Doomed"". This irritated me because why is the resistance even operating when the republic is fully capable of defending itself from the first order. Better yet why not combine forces and put an end to the first order before all of your core planets, senate, and fleet were destroyed by a weapon that could have been easily destroyed years before. Its the little things that take away from this movie. - Captain Phasma was literally non-existent as of right now she is just a rip off of Boba and Jango Fett. - The Smugglers ship with those weird octopus type creatures was terrible reminded me of the Sarlac pit in Return of the Jedi just not as neat and not as scary. =D -Is it just me or do the blaster lasers which all the characters shoot seem like the phasers in Star Trek. The sound, explosion, and the weight of the shot seemed heavier than in past installments. Star was blaster fire always felt light yet precise and powerful. Overall just go see it the movie is good and you won't be left feeling saddened or disgusted. Many have given this negative reviews because it ""does not feel like star wars"" but just think when Empire Strikes Back was released everyone hated it and critics gave it very bad reviews. However, today it is viewed as the best in the series. Give this movie 30 years and you'll look back and realize that all of the Star Wars movies Past and Present were amazing.  "

I am afraid that contrary to the seemingly endless praise given to this film and its director, Tony Kaye, and indeed recommendations from my friend that I should see this film, when I did I felt cheated and annoyed. There's no denying that what the film portrays is shocking and powerful, and that Edward Norton's performance is equally powerful, almost coming close in intensity to De Niro's Bickle, and the set-pieces are well made, but the inability for the filmmakers' to create a convincing story spoilt the whole film for me - the way we see in endless flashbacks (often the sign of a weak storyteller), Norton's firstly ordinary, sane, likable character's seemingly easy conversion to a Nazi maniac just by his dad uttering a few racist sentences at the dinner table is frankly ridiculous. Plus his seemingly easy conversion back from a Nazi maniac while in prison, just through speaking to a nice black guy. I'm sorry, but it just negates the whole film's power. Not to mention the endless flashy camera techniques used by former ad director Kaye, NOTE: slow motion close ups of a running shower tap does not a good film make. The film opens on a black and white shot of the ocean, for no apparent reason, leading to the conclusion that Kaye thought he could appear as a 'clever' and 'sophisticated' filmmaker by showing us an 'arty' opening sequence.

149056,tt0401792,AdamBowl23,united states,10,One of the all time greats,"I'll start by stating that I have never read the Sin City graphic novels, but I am a fan of Frank Miller's work (his work on Daredevil and Batman is amazing), so I had high expectations coming in, and those expectations were met and greatly exceeded. First off, just the style of the movie is unlike anything I've ever seen. The use of color in the black and white setting is breathtaking. The same effect was used in Pleasantville, but it was put into a new level here. Second, the stories are captivating and I didn't want them to end. You get attached to the characters and hate to see their story close. Lastly, whoever did the casting for the movie deserves a raise. Even though Bruce Willis doesn't really look the part of 60-70 year man, he plays the part perfectly, and then there's Jessica Alba and Brittany Murphy, enough said. This was one of those movies, that after I finished seeing for the first time, I immediately put on my list of all time favorites and it has also inspired me to start writing again. Can't wait for the sequels and I think Miller should consider directing more, as I can tell some of his personal touches in the movie. I like Rodriguez, but I'm still trying to forgive him for those Spy Kids movies. But Sin City is a must see for anybody, there's something for the whole family to enjoy.  "

It puts gang violence into a more ""every day"" setting and it makes it out to be something that is okay and somehow justified. In the beginning of the film it is stated that everything that they do is part of protecting ""the family"" and that the mob is a kind of police for ""wise guys"". They make it feel as though everything that they are doing is morally right. I have to say that the movie could have been better if there was less glorification. They could have had more realistic events and more realistic emotions. In the end this is based on true crime and it would have been nice to see a less Hollywood influenced story line and characters.  "

It is a complete gem. However, if your an American this could be SO different. The humour and the rawness just wouldn't suit the majority of US people In My Opinion. On the storyline, some people have said that it glamourises drug use but nothing could be further from the truth. It shows just how well, CRAP, their lifes actually are. There is nothing glamourous about their actions or how we see them. In fact, if it wasn't for the humour, it would be completely dull....NOT BORING....just DULL. Oh yeah, and it has a kick ass soundtrack! ""Iggy Pop is not dead!"" I rate TRAINSPOTTING 10/10.  "

112093,tt0077416,adamd-8,united states,10,Cinematic Brilliance,"No movie before or after has effected me remotely as much as ""The Deer Hunter"" has. It is without a doubt the most emotionally driven, heartbreaking film I've ever experienced. The plot with it's simplicity instantly draws you into the lives of these characters which can easily be adapted to persons we all know or have known in our lives. The film opens to a small working class factory town seemingly isolated from the rest of the world. Main characters are established and we discover the underlying truth that seems to hang over everyone like a dark cloud. It is the middle of the Vietnam War, and three of the friends are volunteers to leave everything they know within the next few days. I break this movie into 3 parts, before, during and after the war. Before the war we see character development at it's best. We see 1 friend get married and experience a traditional Russian wedding. At one point DeNiro and Walken's characters encounter a soldier at a bar and when asked a response about their departure the soldier replies simply ""fuck it"". I thought this was a brilliant suggestion for things to come. The start of the second part begins by blowing your mind with a scene jump that is comparable to that of 2001:A space Oddyssey. Here we experience a game of forced Russian roulette onto the 3 friends. I remember the first time watching this scene barely able to keep control when placing myself in their position imagining what it would be like to play live and die with someone so close to you they are like your blood. When Robert DeNiro laughs in the face of his captors, sweat and tears streaming down his face, pleading his best friend to pull the trigger, it is without a doubt the most extreme example of raw emotion a movie has ever been able to produce. The final part of ""The Deer Hunter"" we see the aftermath that a war can bring, not on a nation, but of the families and friends and their relationships with one another. Whether drawn in or ripped apart, the impact on such a tightly knit group of individuals is devastating. In all,my favorite part of this movie is the message that I got from it. To me The Deer Hunter tells us that no matter what happens throughout our lives, we always have a home and there will always be someone there to lick our wounds and recover from the horrors that the world sometimes has. This is not an anti-war film and for those who may say it is have missed the picture. Agree or disagree with the diplomatic actions of a nation, America is beautiful because of the people in it and as long as we embrace, this we'll always have a home. WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! 10 out of 10 stars.  "
67239,tt1345836,adamddodson,united kingdom,7,Good but not Great,"I have been looking forward to this film for quite some time and honestly, I feel it was rushed. It was clear that Nolan didn't even want to do a third film and this rings true for me. With the introduction of 4 major characters to all be squeezed in to just under 3 hours is just not enough time. After discussion I felt the film could have easily been halved and made in to 2 films that would have given the characters and story the time it needed to be played out. But obviously this was never going to happen. I feel it is the weakest of the trilogy (I personally think 'Begins' is the best overall, say what you will, but without Heath Ledger 'The Dark Knight' would have killed me through boredom) and would have been just ""good"" for me apart from the final 20 minutes really sealing the deal and making it much better. Anne Hathaway was my star performance, I was really critical of her casting originally but she really pulled it out of the bag. Split in to 2 films this could have been a great, but unfortunately Nolan tried to squeeze 6 or 7 story arcs in to one movie. Although a decent send off to the trilogy.  "

Sometimes I felt tense, sometimes I felt sad, sometimes I was just amazed. At the beginning of the movie you may think, where are all these epic scenes I saw in the trailer? But don't worry they will come after a while and when they are finally there you are just dragged into the movie until the end. Oh but don't think that it is a non stop action movie from there on. No it is a perfect mix between the tension of being in space and the sadness you feel when you remember that the time doesn't go quiet as quick for the people on earth. The only bad thing that I didn't like about this movie is that the ending is a little obvious. At the beginning of the movie there is a scene were you can already guess what is going to happen. But you don't know the context or the rest of the story. So to rap up, it is still one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I recommend it to everyone to go and watch it.  "

The acting was mediocre, the sub plots within the movie were completely under developed and only served to blur the main plot, and the ending was bewildering.

Where this differs from the usual cannon fodder is that Leonard has no short term memory and relies on tattoos and photos to carry out his investigation as well as to survive in the dark world he now enhabits. The film is short in reverse so your perspective is always from Leonard's point of view enabling you to empathise and the director to keep you on the edge of your seat through out, never knowing who is honest and who is taking the Leonard for ride.

43663,tt0816692,adamgonzalezmusic,united states,10,One of the best Sci-Fi film's ever made.,"Interstellar Film Review by Adam Gonzalez Written and Directed by Christopher Nolan (Dark Knight Trilogy, Inception, The Prestige, Memento) ""Interstellar"" is about a team of astronauts who travel through a wormhole in hopes to save the human race. This epic Sci-Fi film stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Wes Bently, Michael Caine and John Lithgow. You'll be captivated by the visual intergalactic voyage coupled with the heart riveting musical score by Hans Zimmer (Pirates of the Caribbean, Dark Knight Trilogy, Lion King, Inception). But what makes this film even more impressive is how it was made. By creating real-life sets and shooting at physical locations, Nolan made Interstellar look and feel more like a NASA documentary as opposed to a computer generated movie blockbuster. He also made it a point to use little to no green-screen special effects throughout the film so that both the actors and the audience can have an authentic reaction to his story. To further solidify this apocalyptic drama, Nolan had Kip Thorne, a theoretical physicist in gravitational and astrophysics, make sure that everything in the film was established on real science. Its hard to not get engulfed in this film, especially when you have such a strong cast led by McConaughey. Every role played such an integral part in the overall story and you will feel as though you have traveled to the end of the galaxy by the time your done.  "

Written and directed by Damien Chazelle, WHIPLASH is about a young drummer named Andrew Neyman (played by Miles Teller) who gets accepted into the best music school and lands a spot in the most cutthroat orchestra band led by conductor Terence Fletcher (played by J. K. Simmons). Andrew aspires to be one of the greats like his idol Buddy Rich (arguably the best jazz drummer that ever lived) but knows that this dream comes with heavy sacrifices. Andrew soon realizes that Fletcher's methods are extreme and pushes his students to the edge of their ability, sometimes with harsh consequences. Being a drummer myself I can totally relate to the competitive nature of being the best musician you can possibly be. Fletcher's obsession with winning prestigious competitions clashes with Andrew's drive to be the best. The hostility of Andrew and Fletcher explodes on the screen physically and musically with amazing drum solos and physical altercations. This film is a musical roller coaster ride that will have you on the edge of your seat the entire way through.  "

Perhaps it's because of the hype that surrounds this film, but I was really disappointed with what I saw. Two and a half hours was too long in my view, and nothing particularly out of the ordinary happens. I didn't find it clever, nor were the ""unforgettable"" scenes like the dance between Travolta and Thurman or Samuel L Jackson's speech unforgettable. Maybe because cinema has advanced so much since 1994 that I would have had to watch it then to appreciate it, but I only recently saw Hitchcock's Rear Window for the first time and enjoyed that immensely. People go on as if this film has the best storyline and gangster scenes ever but quite frankly, it doesn't. Moreover, I found Natural Born Killers more affective for it's style than Pulp Fiction. It does have some good scenes, and I was rooting for Bruce Willis' character throughout, but I saw nothing that makes this film outstanding or worthy of being so high in IMDb's rankings.  "

Fear, dread, suspense, all mingled in with humor and joy. For a well rounded film, this takes the cake as being my top film of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if Hanks takes a Best Actor award and Duncan a Leading Actor award! This movie was a GREAT rendition of the book as well. The only thing that it skimped on was deleting one character, although I can see that it would have changed the experience totally; the character being at the end, and causing pain in the book.

In fact I was kind of hoping that his wife was dead and not just missing. I really hoped he killed her because I didn't like her character and I really hoped Affleck would die too in a shoot out with cops; and I kind of hoped he would get lucky and kill them also. Well maybe not the sidekick, he was cool. I just couldn't relate to all of the pretentiousness of the wife's family or even Affleck himself. I mean, I even hoped her parents would die because they were jerks too. About the only person in that movie I found interesting was Affleck's sister, I think her name was Margo. The movie just failed to hook me in an hour and fifteen minutes. No plot twist can recover the amount of boredom I had at the one hour mark. Plus there were some very graphic scenes that didn't really add to the movie (not all, some very well expressed how disturbed individuals were). I don't need to see Affleck going down on a chick on his first date to kind of figure out they bumped uglies. Graphic scenes have their purpose but when you over-do it, you lose value.  "

At first I can't understand this story because the time and places changes one after another. It is an elaborate work, which is due to the director and casts. This story is so unique that I am excited with it. If memories can be deleted in the real, I do not want to do so. Because past is becoming more and more brilliant as time goes by, I believe. Even if it was hard then to put up with what you had experienced, several years later it will be one of the great or important things.

He tries to go back home but Lionel says to him that he stakes 1 shilling on possibility that King George VI can speak fluently.

Later he listens to the record and he is surprised at his own eloquent voice. After that he trusts Lionel and starts the therapy. That is the way they make close friends. I like the characters of this film, especially Lionel. He is apparently rude but this is his way he communicates with patients. He relieves others' mind by talking frankly. I like such an attitude very much. If there are doctors who are like him, I also see them. This film is based on the real story of the relationship between King George VI and Lionel.

But it also means we'll get more of this stuff. Inception is an instant classic! Everything about the film is at least 8/10 worthy. First of all, the idea. What brilliance! Only a psychological film fanatic like Christopher Nolan could come up with something like this. It's just an incredibly entertaining and mind-blowing concept. (10/10) The writing is not quite as good as other Nolan films (TDK and Interstellar in mind here) but still keeps our eyes glued to the screen for the whole film. Also the plot/storyline is very interesting, and a bit confusing. (8/10) The Acting is Near Perfect! Leonardo DiCaprio is by no means my favorite actor. But I will admit he is very talented. And he shines in the starring role. Marion Cotillard, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, and Ken Watanabe all excel in their roles as well. But the person who is most underrated and, in my opinion, gave the best output was Joseph Gordon-Levitt! He is an amazing supporting actor and is really good as the comrade of Dom Cobb. Plus, I dig the name Arthur. (9/10) The Editing/Music/Visual Effects are insane! The best part about the visuals is that most were done with practical stunts and set pieces rather than CGI or other FX. The classical music background is very soothing in an intense movie. (9/10) Overall, this film was brilliant and it is my second-favorite Chris Nolan film (besides TDK). (9/10)  "
50357,tt0407887,adamk-2,united kingdom,2,"Deliriously loopy, hysterically bad","I finally caught up with this only recently, and had to keep pulling my jaw up from the floor.

It's as if Scorcese had dozed off in front of ""Goodfellas"" one night after eating a cheese and garlic pizza, and thinking, ""How can I top this∂?.top this∂?.top this∂?"" And this film is the result. Not so much a film, but a dream of a film, one that defies any sort of logic. There's a rat in the gang. Could it be the ex-cop who's always on his phone? Nope, because ∂?after all ∂? they asked him, and he said it wasn't. Well, fair enough. Meanwhile, there's a rat in the police force. Could it be the cop who grew up under the wing of the mobster under investigation, the one who leaps onto his phone in full view of everyone as soon as an operation against said mobster is announced? Naaaah. Meanwhile we also have a police psychiatrist who, as luck would have it, is gorgeous and who, as her sense of professionalism would have it, thinks it's okay to sleep with not just one but two of her clients. A definition of a bad film, (which I read on a website dedicated to bad films) states that you know you're watching a bad film when the plot will only progress if the characters act stupidly. This, ladies and gentlemen, is one of those films. To be fair, Damon and Cipriano are surprisingly good, the latter, in particular, having developed a leaner, meaner look than he's known for. Unfortunately, these are balanced out by average, TV-movie performances by Sheen and Baldwin, a bogglingly bad one by Wahlberg (a piece of wood rolled on to bark rude comments) a stunningly confused one by Ray Winstone (what is that accent again?) and then∂?there's Jack. Any hopes that this might be one those roles that allow him to recall his acting skills are swiftly ditched by the scenery-chomping on display here, as if Nicholson were bored and decided he could only get through it by making it as surreal as possible, meanwhile coming across as neither Irish nor Bostonian. He's no longer an actor, he is a performer, a grandstander, and this is what you get. If you don't want characterisation or subtle emotions, you call Jack. You also, in his wake, get the wildly uneven tone, veering into off-the-wall black humour (the hand at the breakfast table ∂? what was with THAT?) and moments so throwaway it looked for all the world as if they were being made up on the spot (Nicholson appearing, covered in blood). The end piles on twist upon twist and body upon body which, on the surface, are entertaining enough, but just don't hold up to any sort of scrutiny (and the psychiatrist does what with the tapes?) A passable no-brainer action film, and an entertaining exercise in loopy film-making from a director who should know better, praised by fans and critics who should also know better.  "

Only the greatest minds like Einstein and Newton are able to solve them, to see and understand them for what they truly are, surpassing the limits of the human mind. And The Dark Knight is no exception. No ordinary human being would be able to appreciate its true glory and splendor since we can only ""see"" so much. And this is the reason why I have to watch this film again and again, so as to unlock its mystery and understand the real truth to its beauty as much as my mind possibly can. And by the way, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was absolutely out of this world. I couldn't get enough of watching him and sadly, I want more. As for the rest, everything was just right and perfect. Kudos to everyone who took part in this film especially to Christopher Nolan and his vision of the franchise.

It won four Oscars for cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing and visual effects. What is was disappointed by was the fact the acting didn't get any nominations.

You can relate to the characters and feel for them. For the time the effects are wonderful and the scenery is amazing. Some scenes are gruesome but the thing that makes the film better is the haunting, iconic soundtrack. It just lifts the film from good to greatness. Steven Spielberg truly made a name for himself from this film. The concept has been imitated but has obviously never been matched. It brings us a rememberale theme turn, a haunting villain and an array of real human characters.  "

I think Age of Ultron will be better but this is still a fun and enjoyable film. I love how it appeals to everyone not just comic book fans. I can't find any flaws in this movie , it kinda has everything you need in a good movie:action, comedy, cool quotes and stunning special effects. I also love how marvel did movies before this one so the characters could be developed. The casting choices were also great. Everyone fits perfectly as the character they were chosen to play. Robert Downey Jr is great as Iron Man and Scarlett Johannson is amazing as Black Widow. My favourite is Samuel L Jackson as the tough but amazing Nick Fury. All in all WATCH THIS FILM.  "
3789,tt0068646,adam-moore1308,new zealand,8,Certainly overrated but still a great film,"This film is often regarded as perfect including the acting which is renowned as some of the best in the history of cinema. However I was quite underwhelmed by the performances except for Marlon Brando who is truly captivating whenever he is on screen (which is surprisingly not that often considering he won best LEAD actor for his performance.) Even Al Pacino's performance is both emotionless and forgettable in my opinion. I'm not going to waste time talking about everything that makes this film good because everyone has done that. What I am going to do is just mention some of the reasons why, overall, I was disappointed in the film. My first problem with the film is that I often found the story stretched thin by too many characters and occasionally found myself confused by the many unfamiliar Italian names that kept popping up. The first two hours of the film are exceptionally entertaining, well made and expertly written. However it is around the two hour mark where what was making the story so captivating is almost completely resolved and we are then forced to sit through another hour of a film that is no longer all that interesting. The three hour run time of the film is certainly unnecessary as even though seeing Michael take over the reigns of the family and watching Vito die is still great stuff it feels like it could have been covered in 15 minutes instead of adding another hour to a film that felt like it had already ended. I do understand that my opinion will not be popular but I felt that I should mention my problems with the film and stop some people being brainwashed by its 9.2 IMDb rating and then instantly saying that its a masterpiece so they could be accepted even though they may have found parts of it boring. I don't know... Perhaps my expectations were too high. "

A jocular epic that bitingly indicts excess at its highest level possible within contemporary society. DiCaprio kills his performance as the titular Wolf, an abominable creation that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as De Niro's finest collaborations with Scorsese. Formally the veteran director is as inventive and unruly as ever, hyperactively deploying muscular tracking-shots, aspect ratio shifts and unconventional compositions like it ain't no thang. Stylistically the result is marginally less dazzling than say Scorsese-opus Casino but the tonal command throughout is masterful. One criticism is that the film is less engaging in its third-act comedown but that feeling quickly dissipates as Scorsese uncannily saves his pi«˘ce de r«∏sistance for WOWS' final shot.  "
12005,tt0110912,adammurrayxd,united kingdom,6,"A non biased review on ""one of the best films of all time!""","Tarantino for me is a good director. Not a great director and certainly not the best. Many people I know hail Pulp Fiction as not only Tarantino's best film ever, but the best film of all time. I like Tarantino. He is a smart writer with a lot of interesting ideas. Some of which i think are better than the others. Pulp fiction contains a lot of those brilliant unique ideas but I feel, fails to put them into practice in order to make an interesting and exciting film. *Spoilers ahead if you haven't seen the film already go watch it and decide for yourself. Then see if you agree with me after.* Any good film should have characters that the viewer can care about and be interested in. Now seeing as Pulp Fiction is split in to different stories of different people that is already a hard thing to do. Hard but not impossible. Sin City despite its many faults had me rooting the whole way through hoping that Bruce Willis would be safe and manage to rescue Jessica Alba from the clutches of that strange yellow guy. Pulp fiction however does not manage the same. After the incredibly smart conversation between Travolta and Jackson in the opening scene I was loving the film. I really liked the writing even if this sort of Philosophical conversation didn't quite fit Travolta's Pony-tailed Hit-man character. The abrupt switching to Bruce Willis' story then made me almost forget about Travolta all together, so much so that when, who i thought was the main protagonist, gets shot halfway through the film. It didn't really mean anything. I moved on. It wasn't impacting enough for me to feel any sort of emotion. It was like when the wise talking heavy gunner in a Vietnam movie gets shot. You quite liked him. But you can move on without him. The scene with Harvey Keitel however was brilliant. My favourite part of the film without a doubt. Its just a shame he didn't play more of a part. Other than characters, I felt that the films real weakness was the lack of any strong plot. Yeah all of the crooks stories manage to inter-wind but i didn't feel that they were interesting enough for that to be the films main selling point. I felt at the end i had quite enjoyed what i just saw but really i could have not seen it and went on with my day. I personally feel like Pulp Fiction is a film that relies entirely on its Style to try and carry it forward. I will admit, it is a film with a very well written script, great conversation pieces and an incredible cast. It just fails at being anything more than boring.  "
93718,tt0372784,adamnad-1,united states,9,One of 2005's 10 Best Films. Should have been nominated for best picture,"Batman Begins is easily the best of the Batman films. The cast with the exception of Katie Holmes is outstanding. Gary Oldman is convincing as Gordon and Michael Caine makes a great Alfred. Christian Bale makes a good Bruce Wayne/Batman. Christopher Nolan's Batman is complete departure from the Jokey, Overblown, lame star-driven previous Batman films. The film rather than casting Hollywood Mega-Stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jim Carrey, and Jack Nicholson wisely chooses great actors over great stars. The action is mostly well handled. The Batmobile chase is also very good. It is also the first of the Batman films that allows the actors to act and puts Batman/Bruce Wayne ahead of the villains. The screenplay is itelligent and well-written. This is an entertaining and well made film that is easily one of the best films of 2005. 9/10 Excellent.  "
109871,tt0434409,adamnad-1,united states,1,Average Movie. Substantial for a Comic Book,"V for Vendetta. Is an e enjoyable and sometimes irritating film. The film is full of substance for a comic book. The movie spends a great deal of time showing us the Fascist Totalitarian State of Britain and it captures it quite well. The movies politics are a major hindrance however and little insulting. The Christian Bishop is a pedophile and ex military commander and Stephen Fry's character calls the Koran beautiful. The movie could have done without those two scenes. The movie is certainly light on logic as V is easily able to get at his enemies in a totalitarian state! Natalie Portman gives a crappy performance and is not believable as British. Her accent and acting are poor. I think Keira Knigtley would have worked much better in the role. The supporting cast of Oscar Nominees Stephen Rea and John Hurt are largely wasted. The character of V is very derivative and echos a little bit Phantom of the Opera, Zorro, Man of La Mancha, and little bit of the architect from the Matrix sequels. The direct and script are sometimes poor as the action and story are less than impressive. The film has some great moments is often preposterous largely thanks to a heavy handed script and equally heavy handed direction. End result 5/10 Average. Not worthy of the Top 250.  "
68940,tt0169547,adamofliberty,united kingdom,9,American Beauty,"American Beauty is about hope, love, freedom, depression, and family. Lester Burham is presented as a depressed, common man who is unhappy with his job and his life at home. He comes across as a bit of a 'loser' as his wife and daughter think this and walk all over him. The wife Carolyn is a ambitious business woman who seeks success and only cares about that as she thinks it will gain her happiness. Underneath it all, she's innocent to what she really has in her life but can't see it as she thinks too positively about business. The daughter Jane is an insecure, confused girl who resents her father for not being there for her. As the story goes on, she falls in love with the boy next door as he understands her. After having enough of living a miserable, slave-like life. Lester decides to make a few changes in his life which will make him happier. The more free he gets, the happier he gets. Turning from a loser to living the American dream, Lester starts to remember his good times as a teenager. He quits his soul less job and starts to stick up for himself when his wife tries to take control of him. Much to Carolyn's anger, Lester starts to gain freedom in his life more then she does. The ending is a great twist how it demonstrates that Lester is truly happy that he once had a joyful, yet happy family he was grateful for and that he has 'Beauty' in his life that is Carolyn when she was younger used to be different and in love and this movie gives the real established view of everyday life.

66246,tt1345836,adamotmani,united kingdom,10,Thank you Chris Nolan...Thank you,"It's finally here..and boy is it here. The Dark Knight Rises flies in with a wave of momentum after The Dark Knight and blasts straight through it with great purpose and meaning. This isn't just a big-budget summer blockbuster that 'needs to be done'...this story has been spawned from the minds of men & women who genuinely care, respect and understand the batman franchise and its fans. Christopher Nolan's trilogy has been commended for its realism and genuine understanding of the graphic novels. He has sent us into a world of fear, chaos and now pain with the arrival of Bane. Tom Hardy has made this character so genuine and frightful, once again (in true Nolan fashion) he has gone to the source material and has understood that Bane is as much brain as he is brawn...and when it comes to brawn, it isn't mindless attacks and nonstrategic offence aka Poison Ivy's bitch. Bane has been trained in similar fashion to how Bruce Wayne was, thus making him the perfect adversary for The Caped Crusader. With all the attention on Heath Ledger's 'replacement', some of the shine may have been taken off of Christian Bale. In this case he shines through all the way, whether he is an overwrought & pessimistic Bruce or a resurgent & passionate Batman; Bale delivers a fantastic character. He has really adapted and evolved both sides of Bruce, but has stayed true to who he was in both Batman Begins & The Dark Knight. Micheal Caine, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman return on TOP FORM and most importantly relevant form. Just like in the previous Nolan films all 3 characters were necessary in aiding, understanding and advancing Batman the person and Batman the story. As it has been said before, Alfred is his heart, Lucius the brain and Gordon the conscience...that rings true more than ever in TDKR. As well as Tom Hardy, the other newcomers each add a new dimension to the franchise without denting (no pun intended) it at all. Anne Hathaway is a well orchestrated Selina Kyle; sexy, deviant, smart & well organised character who primarily looks out for 'NO.1'...she is awesome, the best Catwoman I have seen (sorry Michelle, not so much Halle). Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Marion Cotillard portray 2 characters that may be foreign to some people...but whether you have heard of them or not, they will astound you with their respective contributions to this epic tale. All in all TDKR is an outstanding story that is brilliantly acted and fantastically directed. Christopher Nolan has given us something that we can cherish for a lifetime. Whether you favour the origins of The Caped Crusader, the anarchy of The Joker or the all-out war and destruction of Bane it doesn't matter∂?for the 1st time in a long time there is no weak link. They can all be adored collectively and appreciated as the best comic- book films ever.  "
17144,tt0137523,adamp-6,united states,10,something I've noticed people aren't discussing.," A lot of words have been spoken/ written/ transmitted about ""Fight Club"" and its messages about men who haven't entirely grown up and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah, but I haven't seen (yet) anyone tackle this movie from a religious standpoint. First, let me say ""Fight Club"" is a brilliant movie, and I considered it the best movie of 1999 (I'm sure that means just tons to everyone). But here's why the movie spoke to me -- it seems to me that the filmmakers, whether consciously or not, are saying that people who grow up with no moral or spiritual compass to guide them will eventually be morally and spiritually bankrupt. Tyler even says this in one of the scenes (something along the lines of ""our fathers are our role models for God. And if they left us, what does that say about God?""). Pow. Tyler believes God's no longer in the picture, so he can do whatever the heck he wants. Tyler represents people who've grown up with no belief in God or any sort of values system that He handed down, and that lack of belief is ultimately what leads to his extreme behavior. But the statement of the movie is that people like Tyler are to be pitied, not revered.  "

And even though I'd emptied my bladder before said purchase and sipped sparingly from said drink, I found myself in desperate need of the restroom just as the hobbits reached Rivendell. But I endured. So absorbed in the story was I that I tapped my feet, squinched my legs, and performed all other manners of contortions to keep from wetting myself so that I could take in every second of cinematic bliss that unfolded on the screen before me. So take heed -- drink nothing for several days before going to see this movie. Or take a bedpan with you.  "

Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for the rest of the day. That night I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind trying to wrap itself around the story, and I absolutely could not GO TO SLEEP! I finally just gave up on sleep, got up around midnight, and watched ""Election"" to cleanse my palate. Then I went back to bed and starting contemplating ""Memento"" AGAIN. Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to sleep. This is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure it all out. And that can only be done with extensive internet research. Reading ""Memento Mori"", the short story upon which the movie is ""based"" helped, too. ""Memento"" is nothing short of a phenomenon. And a brilliant one at that.  "

But finally, curiosity got the best of me and I checked it out. Boy, am I glad I did. Because as brutal as it is, ""Requiem for a Dream"" is still a masterpiece of filmmaking. Yes, it is frank with its subject matter, in the kind of way that makes critics use words like ""honest"" and ""unblinking"". And that frankness adds to the impact of the overall film. When you consider the muck these characters drag themselves through in order to quell their own appetites -- that's powerful stuff. But even more powerful is the style in which the story is told. It's a unique and often objective representation of the lifestyle portrayed, and it is nothing short of masterful. I've now seen this movie 3 times in 5 days, and I can honestly say I'm blown away. Man, am I glad I never did drugs.  "

""Unforgiven"" is one of those movies. Somber, meditative, and almost plodding, ""Unforgiven"" had me fighting to keep my eyes open -- not because it's boring, but because I just... had... to finish... it. I'm glad I did, too.

Have these people seen ""Memento""? Or ""Moulin Rouge""? Or ""The Royal Tenenbaums""? Why is ""A Beautiful Mind"", a fairly standard film, receiving all these accolades? Unfortunately, I have the feeling that my thoughts on ""A Beautiful Mind"" are probably skewed from all the wonderful press and praise it received before I viewed it (sadly, the same thing happened with ""Gladiator""). I was expecting some elegant masterpiece, but instead got a movie that, while it features good acting, is still a slave to Hollywood convention. (insert spoilers warning here) Okay, so we start off with John Nash at Princeton, and we have all the classic high school/ college elements -- the socially outcast main character, the bully with the chip on his shoulder who's got it in for the main character, the wisecracking-yet-all-knowing roommate, the stern authority figure, the problem that can't be solved but suddenly is given a solution thanks to an unrelated real world situation, etc. And it just went on from there. More convention on top of convention. A lot of critics are praising this movie for being a good big budget film that came from a major studio. Since when do we grade possible Oscar contenders on a curve? Formula is formula, regardless of who's selling it. It's sad, too, because this could've been one of those ""small treasures"" kinds of movies, had the hype machine not gotten so squarely behind it.  "

How on earth are you so isolated as to think that this is the most violent movie out there? Have you not seen any movies since 1994? Because believe me, this movie could practically slide by with a PG-13 today (well not really) But honestly, if you don't like the move, then sure, fine, you don't like it, but why would you attack it's content when there are so many other movies that are MUCH more violent?

Choi Min-sik is one of my favourite parts of this film; his performance as Oh Dae-su is absolutely believable and he shows a lot of heart and passion in his quest for vengeance. Oh Dae-su and we as the audience learn that it is more a journey for the truth as to why Dae-su was imprisoned for 15 years rather than a journey for revenge against whoever did this to Dae-su. This is real indie art-house cinema and it is beautiful, sometimes brutal an other time s chilling, but always powerful. I'll never forget the twist at the end where Dae-su's captor had made him commit incest with his daughter the whole time! Not to mention the painful yet beautifully shot moment where Dae-su cuts out his tongue. The ending was just so beautiful, what a perfect way to end this film with a wintry landscape and a view of a snowy mountain throughout the entire end credits. Oldboy is a magnificent piece of foreign cinema, though some of the violence and the sex scenes I have a problem with, other than that it is a gorgeous and beautifully edited, directed and acted masterpiece!

57180,tt0078788,AdamRant,united states,10,The most important Epic of the Baby Boomer Generation," Apocalypse Now is not a Vietnam movie, its not even a war movie. It is a modern-day Epic using the classical conventions of Homer to tell its story. From the opening chords of The Doors ""The End"" (which is a miniature version of ""Oedipus"" amongst other myths) we are given clues of the films epic aspirations. All the elements are here: The feeling that we enter a story in progress, like the Odyssey which begins on the journey home after the ten year war, helps to create a sense that Willard (Martin Sheen) has fought his physical war and is ready to move on to war with his self. The unmistakable sense of journey which is snowballing toward an inevitable conclusion. And the obstacles faced by Willard on his journey, his nervous breakdown in the beginning of the film is like a battle of the Gods within himself preparing him for the next step of his life's journey, Kilgore (Robert Duvall) is the Cyclopse, the Playboy Bunnies are the Sirens, and the Dolong bridge is like the River Styx, the entrance to Hades, the point of no return, the screams from the fog are the Furies always in chaotic flux voicing their alienation, and Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) is the insane (sane?) collective unconscious of the Gods. Apocalypse Now is not only an Epic it is THE Epic of its generation, the WWII Generation had Gone With the Wind, the Rock n'Roll Generation has Apocalypse Now. The other important Epic of this Generation is the Star Wars Trilogy which fails in its rather conventional views on morality, its too tight, its too clean, the lines are too clearly drawn, what Star Wars gains in scope with its 3 films is lost in its lack of complexity. The best film of the trilogy The Empire Strikes Back succeeds in being such due to its obvious relation to Greek Tragedy (afterall it does contain one of the greatest reversals in film history). There is an inherent danger in reducing the inner conflict of good and evil down to something as simple as black vs. white, like the Star Wars films do. Lets face it, nothing in life is that simple, and the minute we start believing they are is the minute we start coming apart. Apocalypse Now succeeds precisely because it does come apart, it shows what happens to men in desperate situations and consequently warns us of the dangers of these situations. By the end of the film we aren't sure who is right and who is wrong. When Willard kills Kurtz we don't feel a burden lifted, instead we feel uneasy, because we know there is a little Kurtz in all of us. Any movie that attempts to get an audience to confront these feelings, is no longer just a movie, it transcends to Myth.   "

Is a movie that dwells on looking inside of yourself to find more of yourself what society really needs right now? Aren't we all a little too self-absorbed and a little too much of a production as it is? I don't get the premise, but whatever, if it is funny it is funny... but it isn't funny or cute or quality. Amy Poehler is a bully dressed in pleasantries (as is becoming her typecast), the rest of the cast was much better but the writing was stiff and felt like a bad skit from SNL, the laughs are forced and you really don't care about much other than when it will be done. It tries to be smart and deep but sounds like that person you know who loves to recite facts and news without much else, and you find yourself with the blank half-smile stare you reserve for when JWs are at your door and you forgot to pretend you aren't home. Don't get me wrong, I love animated film done right, I was impressed by ""Wreck It Ralph"" and ""Up"" where the voice acting along with the story and writing fit perfectly, this is nothing near those films.

Although the dogs were ""unharmed"", tranquilization is not allowed under the AHA (American Humane Association)Guidelines for the Safety of All Animals in Filmed Media. AHA believes that tranquilization of an animal is a risk that they do not recommend for the purposes of film-making. Also, AHA's Guidelines are not utilized in Mexico. For these reasons, AHA has rated the film ""Questionable"". If this type of treatment is inappropriate for a human being (brutally being tossed around in the back seat of a car while tranquilized) it should not be done to animals either.  "

I was so curious that I went out the very next day and saw it. Million Dollar Baby is an amazing story and I really liked it. I just think Hilary Swank can pick a winner of a script when she sees one! She may not be Hollywood's top actress, or even in a lot of films - but the ones she does appear in are awesome! I am only 21 years old, and usually right into comedies and the like, but this is a movie that I will definitely see again. I cried. I rated this film 9/10 - but it may be even better than that.

Frankly I was a bit Dissatisfied with it, possibly because I loved the book so much I had high expectations. The Back story takes a long time to develop in the book and in the movie they sorta jumble it all together in a small allotment of time, less than what they should have committed to it. This being said other parts were up to my expectations. The feel of the oppression, V, Evey, All were great fits. I just wish that they would've planned out the storyline a bit better as to fit in more of the details, I decided to re-read the graphic novel after seeing this just to sort out details I thought I already knew, so for someone who without a little prior knowledge, they could be easily lost in the story line.

Everyone was shocked to hear of the passing of Heath Ledger..so when everyone showed up at the premiere to ""pay their respects""...they were were all treated to The Joker, not Heath Ledger. What an amazing acting performance that broke the mold. He redefined the character and showed us a new look at one of the best villains in comic book and cinematic history. The crime story that unfolds is right out of a serial killer's dream. Batman, in true detective form, tries to figure out The Joker, while the Joker figures out Batman... A neverending battle they will continue for ever. Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, and Gary Oldman prove that an actor can change accents and still completely embody another character as performers. "

Maybe the hype was too much but being the concluding part i think Nolan could have given us more. It seemed to have a methodical pace which speeded up towards the end that in my opinion just seemed a bit rushed considering it took such a long time to layout the plot. Batman was as dark as he could have been but needed a few more silky moves. Michael Caine maybe a good luck charm for Nolan but in this case i didn't think he gave a particularly strong performance and his script just seemed a bit weak..its all very well trying to give words of wisdom (as Alfred always should) but when those words are..well..just a little bit pants, it just makes it harder for the actor to shine.

The T-Rex walks out of it's pen, then the jeep falls down a cliff at the same spot. The acting is the worst I've seen in any movie of the last 20 years. By definition, paleontologists mainly study geology of past periods, rather than biology. Thus, we can deduct that the main characters would be more surprised, or make more mention of- the dinosaurs physiological and anatomical attributes such as skin and eye color, body temperature, sounds, and overall appearance. The lumber some walking and bobbing of heads that Hollywood often adopts for dinosaurs is highly uncommon in modern cold blooded reptiles. Even the giant Gila Monsters move swiftly with grace and dexterity. The dramatic human like personalities of the dinosaurs is another purely Hollywood stunt. Yes, velociraptors may have the physiological ability to open a door, but without human reasoning, they wouldn't know ""why"" to open one. The biggest underlying question throughout the movie is ""why?"". Why do the dinosaurs want to kill? Why aren't the characters more surprised and ask more questions? Why are there kids on the island? Why did the director let so many slip-ups pass through the final cut? Why did the boy survive a 10,000 volt electric shock? Feel free to contact me at kingshive@yahoo.com PS Why'd they have to use Newman as Nedry??? Haha, I think he was the best actor in the movie.  "

Chaplin knew this, and he reportedly distracted bankers who came to his set to see for themselves what was going on. Chaplin and his child star Jackie Coogan did flatfoot and shimmy routines that delighted and diffused their uptight backers. So Welles dazzled his inquisitive studio and banking chiefs with displays of magical disappearing acts and levitations. All the while crating a masterpiece behind the closed doors of his set. It was to Welles' good and bad fortune that he convinced Nelson Rockefeller to add additional funding when the original ""Kane"" money was running low. While the production was able to be completed, Welles found himself owing Rockefeller. This debt was reportedly paid in the form of being pulled away from the completion of ""The Magnificent Ambersons"" to do ""It's All True"" at Rockefeller's bequest. The consequence: studio editing of ""Ambersons"" without Welles' approval. It's all about art vs. business, and fortunately ""Ambersons"" turned out well, despite the studio cutting. The negative side was Welles' being placed on a list of hard-to-work-with personalities in the profession. There's been enough said about the value of ""Kane"" among these user reviews, so may these remarks serve as a tiny footnote.  "
149372,tt0058946,adamshl,united states,7,Gillo's Best,"La Battaglia di Algeri (1966) tells a very sad story. That it is true makes it all the more tragic. Yet out of this strife comes a remarkable film. It's easy to see how Pontecorvo made only a few other notable films, the most famous being ""Queimada!"" (1967). His star in the latter, Marlon Brando, undoubtedly was persuaded to work on the basis of Gillo's film of the Algerian-French battle. On reading and viewing the history of the making of ""Battle of Algiers"" I can understand how Pontecorvo put a lifetime of energy and commitment into this project. The film is unforgettable for its realistic, documentary look. There have been other films to obtain such an image, but ""Battle"" is outstanding in the way so large a cast was employed. Indeed, it's hard to believe so many ""extras"" could be recruited, much less give such convincing performances. Two critical quotes of the film are notable: the Washington Post hailed it as being ""just as important for our time as the work of Griffith, Riefenstahl, Dryer and Visconti were for theirs."" And the New Yorker exclaimed, ""Pontocorvo and his team show the capability of convincing the cinema public that revolution, in certain circumstances, is a necessary thing."" While the rebels are given a sympathetic perspective, the French are likewise fairly depicted--all resulting in a kind of observational, reportorial essay on a historical event. The entire viewing experience is quite unforgettable.  "

Much of the humor is dry and/or stale, and the only thing that deserves praise is the classical music score. The dark ages were a fascinating time in which many great stories are set in, even to this day. This movie has plenty of information to weave a coherent plot line around; it just fails to do so. The special effects, well what am I saying- there are no special effects worth mentioning. None of the characters are particularly engaging either. All I can say is this is stale British comedy to the max.  "
15276,tt0167260,adam-sim,united kingdom,10,"Good, but nothing special"," Im sick of seeing people comming out with all this non sense about the Return of The King being the best movie ever. It's by far and away the worst movie out of the three. If you look past how nice the movie is to look at, you realise how Ordinary they are. I know for a fact that if the movies had not of had so much money thrown at them then no-one would even bother seeing it. I dont see how any one can claim a movie which in parts, especially the ending is boring. All I could think when the first fade to black happened was finally, it's over. Just to find out a few seconds later that there was more and more and more. I managed to get roped into seeing again with my family and I actually fell asleep for atleast 2 hours of the movie. Now I have got the negative's out of the way I can move onto the positives. The special effects were quite good. But in most of the battle scenes I thought I was playing on the game. And that bit where legolas or should I say Neo manages to take down one of those elephant things, I couldnt believe my eyes, As it should never of even been in the movie. I have not read the books but I highly dought the Tolkien described Legolas doing that. Overall I feel the movie was probably the second biggest let down of the year, After Reloaded. I would give this movie 7/10. How ever I can't give it a fair score until next year when the 'Special Extended Edition' or The full movie comes out next year.  "
157635,tt0848228,adamsjost,united states,6,Lacks personality,"While I found the action and story decently pleasing overall, I think the movie spread itself incredibly thin in terms of characterization and as such suffers from a distinct lack of personality. I understand that Marvel thought they could forego character development because each character had their own movie (with the exception of the Hulk, as this version is a reboot), I think that there needs to be a lot more going on in order for the characters to be likable. All of the dialogue is either puns, one-liners, or witticisms, as if the movie is one big joke and the actors are constantly winking at the audience. The action and story are pleasing and well thought out, but the characters are completely lacking.  "

At first, it started out slowly, though suspensefully, but began to pick up later on, only to finish its last one-third on another slow and ambiguous note. One of the main problems with this movie is most of the characters' actions are unexplained, we know nothing about these characters and as such, have no reason to care for them. And because of this, I couldn't even begin to explain the story to myself and believe it for the life of me. And that's not even touching the often-bad dialogue. There is zero character development - these characters are all exactly the same in the beginning of the movie as they are at the end. The first two-thirds of this movie were awesome - if it finished on that tone, I would be completely satisfied. But ""No Country for Old Men"" finishes on just as slow and boring of a note as it began on. I won't remember it a year from now.  "
92307,tt0042192,adamtanaka,united kingdom,10,spectacularly good...,"In 1950 there were two great satirical melodramas aiming for the Best Picture statuette. The one that walked away triumphant was this mordant examination of theatrical backstabbing, while Billy Wilder's majestic masterpiece Sunset Boulevard was left empty-handed. While perhaps falling just short of the latter's sweeping splendor, this scabrous classic still stands high on the list of the greatest films of all time. With a heaven-sent script packed with sharp dialogue and biting one-liners, and blessed with a raft of terrific performances, most memorable Bette Davis' aging actress Margo Channing, this sparkles with multi-layered brilliance. Also to look out for is an early appearance by Marilyn Monroe as an actress so bad she 'might as well have been riding a pogo stick for all the difference it would have made'. If only all films could be this good.  "
94879,tt0372784,adamtanaka,united kingdom,8,Great fun...but still far behind Burton,"Expectations were high for Nolan's resuscitation of a franchise killed off by neon nipples and camp overdrive; in the end, the final result, while certainly enjoyable, lacks both the edge and the artistry that one would hope for. One can't fault Nolan's good intentions, but the action sequences are repetitive and dreadfully choreographed, the music is deafening, and while his attempts to ground the story in reality are certainly laudable, it means that the whole thing ends up looking rather dull- certainly when compared to the gleeful Gothic beauty of Burton's Gotham city. Still, Batman Begins is ahead of most summer blockbusters in terms of intelligence, and Nolan's audacious decision to keep the pointy ears under wraps for the first hour certainly pays off. But the whole thing's almost too ambitious- there are far too many villains, the plot's way too far-fetched, and Holmes' taser-wielding love interest just looks lost: only Freeman, Caine and Wilkinson create anything resembling a character- Bale's Batman is pretty good too, him being one of the few able to bring out the darkness in Bruce Wayne. But these are talented actors, and they'll generally do well in the most thankless of parts. In the end, the main problem is that the film feels uncomfortable with itself: it's not really sure what it is, and never settles down. Is it a mindless piece of superhero popcorn fodder, replete with corny lines and silly master-plans? Or is it a dark psychological drama, as its first hour hints at? What is it?  "
49512,tt0103064,adam-tanaka,united states,10,Fantastic!!," T2 is probably the best action movie ever made. Blistering action, stunning visual effects, great performances, amazing cinematography...the list just goes on. T2 blazes like a blistering roller-coaster ride, with each phenomenal scene being impossibly topped by the next, and it is impossible not to be completely and utterly captivated from start to finish. It's just one of those movies that's so good there's just nothing wrong with it- Even Arnie haters should love it; the stunts are just on the limit of credibility, meaning there aren't any ludicrous stunts like in many of his other action films; and there aren't any of his corny phrases (e.g. Predator's ""Stick around"", after having stuck a guy to a pole with a knife)- just the absolutely classic ""Hasta La Vista, Baby!""... It's an action movie about real people, with fleshed out characters that are more than believable and an action movie about real issues, addressing the very real possibility of the creation of artificial intelligence with much more style, subtlety (surprising, but true) and energy than films such as A.I.. Finally, it's just damn cool. Everything about T2 is just cool beyond words, from the Terminator's leather bike-outfit, to his motorbike reloading technique, to his sunglasses. And I haven't even mentioned the mind-blowing T-1000: Robert Patrick creates one of the best and most chilling villains in screen history (he beats the living daylights out of the flashy and badly named 'Terminatrix'), and his death is both horrifying and compelling. However, above all, it's one of the few sequels that is better than the original*, even far better- everything that was bad about the first movie (like the '80s atmosphere, the low budget, the soundtrack, the occasionally dubious acting) is fantastic here. Find. Watch. And enjoy... *NOT the case with the abysmal Terminator 3. A.T.   "

Yet, it takes over an hour for the film to confess this fact, even though everyone already knows. Then, after meeting back up with the wife who is supposed to be dead, the film walks us through her ""masterful"" scheme. which is foiled by getting her cash stolen. Which could have been avoided. you would think that someone capable of all the other preparation would have been able to avoid being robbed by two ""junkie"" looking folks. The robbers can spot that the wife doesn't respond to her fake name and the robbers spot the wife's fake glasses but seem incapable of recognizing her from television even though she looks practically the same. Dumb Dumb Dumb. Anyway then Neil Patrick Harris kidnaps the wife when she goes to him for help. she murders him and escapes returning home to her husband who for whatever reason doesn't just start screaming about her lies and trying to get her thrown in prison. To this point you still see everything coming. predictable predictable. No man would have slept in that house with that woman. and then just when you think you're going to get the smallest amount of satisfaction from this story by fleck inflicting some sort of clever revenge on her , the story takes its first unpredictable turn which is fleck deciding to stay with his wife who framed him for murder and then became a murderer herself just because shes a few weeks pregnant. Get a divorce. let her have the baby in prison and then take it. is this some sort of republican wet dream about the sanctity of marriage and pregnancy? The silly life lesson would be: Even if your wife frames you for her own murder, murders someone else, shows back up at your house, and then behind your back uses your frozen sperm to get herself pregnant, you should stay with your wife and not abort that baby.

The animators of toy story do a super job with all of the characters and make the movies a pleasant see. In my younger days I used to wonder if toys could really talk. This movie brings out that imagination to life and creates a magical world in which toys are alive. This movie does a really good job in exploring the fantasy and imagination of children and their toys. All of the characters fit really well and this movie should be a classic for many years to come.

The story is wonderfully uplifting and the characters are engaging. It is very well written and of course the production is terrific like with all Pixar movies. 'Up' is also surprisingly funny - usually the humour in animated films isn't my thing but this one did make me laugh. Of course, 'Up' is also visually stunning, I watched it in HD but I would love to see it in 3D one day.

There's no doubt about it, this is a very good film. Even with the highly irritating advert breaks every 15 minutes I found it compelling and was engrossed in the storyline. However, I must admit that I didn't think it was as good as many have suggested and there were parts of the film that I thought were poorly executed. In particular, the scenes of violence were unnecessarily long. The audience can easily grasp what is happening without the need for prolonged scenes of brutal beatings that almost force emotions on you. Overall, '12 Years a Slave' is undeniably a powerful film that does a good job at telling a very difficult story. I thought it was well written and acted and I can understand the reasons behind the glowing reviews. A very good film, but I was expecting more to be honest.  "

Never before have I seen a man make such a miraculous recovery - from being on his death bed and unable to move, to swimming through ice cold rivers within the space of a few scenes.

It can't be easy portraying a national hero and it must carry an extra pressure to get it right, but Cumberbatch delivers. As do the rest of the cast, strong performances all round.

The film is packed full of these type of jokes and the one I quoted is one of the better (or less cringeworthy) ones. Most aren't funny in the slightest. I would usually write something about the plot but unfortunately there isn't one, so no spoilers here. That's right, a movie with no plot has somehow managed a score of 8.2 on IMDb - higher than some classics. Obviously I've missed a trick here, but 'Deadpool' didn't do anything for me.

107430,tt0993846,adam-whitmoyer,united states,9,The Wolf of Wall Street,"Spoiler Alert The Wolf of Wall Street is another excellent production put together by Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio. The film is well directed, telling the story of Jordan Belfort, a real life stock broker who got involved in drugs and questionable trading strategies during the 1980's and 1990's. I believe this film is one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances of his career. The Wolf of Wall Street was released at the end of 2013, directed by Martin Scorsese from the Warner Brothers studio. The film was rather long totaling 180 minutes, with an R rating. The cast consists of a number of recognized actors and actresses. The main characters consist of Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jordan Belfort, Jonah Hill who plays Donnie Azoff, and Margot Robbie who plays Naomi Lapaglia, Mr. Belfort's second wife. A few other big names with smaller roles in the film are Matthew McConaughey, Kyle Chandler, and Rob Reiner. The movie is based on a true story of Jordan Belfort, which follows his life when he starts working on Wall Street, becomes a wealthy stock broker, and finally is shut down by the federal government. After Jordan Belfort loses his job on Wall Street after only a few weeks, he teams up with Donny Azoff and they started their own brokerage firm, called Stratford-Oakmont. The company started with a small staff and quickly grew in excess of 250 employees while Jordan trained his core group to trade penny stocks to uninformed investors, a process known as pump and dump. After Stratford-Oakmont was established, the company started filing initial public offerings. Some of the company's strategies and techniques come into question as their profits are through the roof. I was really drawn to this movie, as I'm a big Martin Scorsese fan and a bigger Leonardo DiCaprio fan. In addition to the director and big name actors I was familiar with the story of Jordan Belfort. However I never realized the lifestyle he lived during the 90's. He was comfortable selling individuals junk stocks, which he knew would not make them any money and taking that money to live a lavish life. Another movie with a similar theme is Boiler Room, a Ben Younger film which shows a similar main character, a youngster who works as a broker and makes some not legitimate moves in order to gain personal wealth. The motif of each of these films circles around greed. I would certainly recommend this film, it's well directed with a star studded cast of actors.

I only had 2 problems with this movie: 1) Since the machines are dependent on solar power, (as if they couldn't CHANGE where they got their electricity from) the world governments decide to block out the sunlight. Well. Isn't that bright. Wakie, wakie... without sunlight, plants don't grow. Without plants, animals don't have anything to eat. Without plants and animals, PEOPLE have nothing to eat. So... Let's kill off every living thing on earth, just so we can say we won. We beat the machines. Someone's got the IQ of a grape. Peeled. Still, that's par for the course with governments, so it's not beyond the realm of possibility. 2) Even accepting that our twits... er... governments DID block out the sun, here comes Morpheus, the freedom fighter. His plan is to release all of these people (who are COMPLETELY unaware of their actual situation are are living perfectly happy ""lives"" INSIDE The Matrix) into the real world... where their muscles have to be rebuilt, where there is no sun, no plants, no animals, and NO FOOD. What's the phrase? From Scylla to Charybdis, perhaps? From frying pan to fire? Given that we only know what our senses tell us, and the input from our senses is interpreted by our brains, wouldn't these people be better off INSIDE? There they may be ""slaves,"" but they are living comfortable, happy lives (according to the sensory data that their brains are registering, at any rate). They get to determine the course of their virtual lives just as if they were living in the real world (excepting that they're more comfortable than they would be aboard the Nebuchadnezzar). Now, having gotten THAT off of my chest, this is a great movie, provided it is approached from the correct perspective. I didn't see Top Gun for the plot. Nor did I see Days of Thunder for the plot. This movie is EYE-CANDY. Great special effects, decent (while not outstanding) acting, lots of action sequences, and visually pleasing thespians (Carrie-Anne Moss and Belinda McClory are both knockouts and, I assume, the feminine gender appreciates the surface aspects of Keanu Reeves). Perhaps the best acting was done by Hugo Weaving (compare Agent Smith with Elrond in ""Lord of the Rings"" and you'll see the range that Weaving achieves). I have to dock the movie a point each for the plotholes mentioned above, but, subsequent to the suspension of disbelief, the storyline follows the expected paths and provides substantial entertainment (which is what we were watching it for in the 1st place).

This was one of the best movies I've seen in several years (even glossing over the fact that 90% of the most recent movies have been schlock, that's still saying something)! This movie was terrific! Take your sweetie. Take the kids. Heck, go alone! See this movie! It is hysterical. There are one-liners you'll find yourself quoting afterwards. ""What is it with men and asking directions?"" Christopher Columbus didn't need directions and neither do I! That's what GPS is for. (-; It's got a cute story (see the plot summaries), good characterization, good acting, good writing... the only minor deficiency was that Marlin and Dory tended to get a little annoying after a while. It was in-character, it was just an annoying aspect of their characters. Whatever. See this movie. Rent it. Heck, BUY it! I plan to. And no hurling on the shell, OK... I just waxed it.  "
135691,tt0093779,adamzad,united states,9,I am not left-handed!," This movie is a spoof. A spoof of adventure movies. A spoof of medieval pirate romances. A spoof of just about everything. It is fun. It is funny. It is tongue-in-cheek. AND it is eminently quotable. ""Inconceivable!"" ""Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" ""Good night. Sleep well. I'll probably kill you in the morning."" ""If only we had a wheelbarrow!"" This film is a favorite of the most disparate people. It doesn't matter what kind of movies you like or don't like, if you enjoy laughing (and I haven't yet met anyone who doesn't), you will love this movie. If you've read my other reviews (e.g., Gattaca, Wild At Heart, Blue Velvet, Mo' Money, etc), you know I am a harsh critic. I can think of exactly 2 positive reviews I have posted (counting this one... Finding Nemo is the other). For me to post a positive review means the movie MUST be worthwhile.

Faramir is the latest sad casualty to this overall change to the original story. Also the Ents could have been better handled. I could go on with this line of criticism but why bother. If you haven't read the books (heck, even if you have...) and believe that the Lord of the Rings is your typical superficial, without a shred of subtelty Good vs. Evil story and that the upshot is that some short people need to throw a ring in a volcano, and that entertains you, then you may enjoy this film. If your looking for something more transcendent you will be disappointed. The screenwriters, which ones I don't know, have done a poor job of translating Tolkien to the screen (and no, capturing Tolkien's spirit is difficult but not impossible in a movie so don't throw out that straw man), and contrary to what Peter Jackson stated on the special edition DVD of FoTR, they have not stayed as close to the original story as possible and HAVE thrown their own spin in.

Sure if you watch it deeply you can never get out of the concept unless you are fully aware of the story before you see. The screenplay was really outstanding and provided the best visual. Sound - nothing to mention, it was really awesome. And about the cast, they were excellent and blend nicely into the character.

Its like end of Oprah for we Potterheads.:') Chris Columbus had small books in his hand to be converted into the big screen.Still he was the reason for putting in such a big family together. But David Yates' The name speaks for itself. God bless him for bringing in such a complicated book into a great finale! This movie has every reason to win an Oscar.Its shame if Alan Rickman didn't get the Oscar this time. I appreciate there work on converting a 2D movie into 3D. Did a convincing job. Not too good but acceptable. I love the way movie starts.The score ""lily's theme"" is composed very well. Halena did very good job as Hermione!the Gringot's scene was one of the highlight of the movie. As the go to Hogwarts' I was like ""WOE Hogwarts so fast"". And I see many complaining for not showing Dumbledore's past. All i can ask is why is that needed? :s From there on the goosebumps stuff's starts! When harry walks in room of requirement, It was just like our hero is back.I had that feeling. And there is a scene when harry walks out of the group towards Snape and the whole order comes out of the entrance.It sure was very well directed. Then harry says the best lines of the movie. ""HOW DARE YOU STAND WHERE HE STOOD!! HOW ABOUT YOU TELL TELL THEM HOW IT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT HOW YOU LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE THE MAN YOU TRUSTED AND KILLED HIM"" And Magie smith stole the show with her performance. When Mcgonagal said ""Hogwarts is threatened,Men in the boundary's protect us.Do your duty for our school"" !! :') I felt like protected when statues Awakes!! The score from Alexander Desplate for this scene was mind blowing! Nevill was given a great role and Showed his courage and he stole the show for sometime. And Snape dieing in Boat house rather than Shrieking shack was a great move.The way Nagini Bit him and tears in his eyes were really hard to take in. I was not really impressed by the kiss between Ron and Hermione.But that really didn't bother me. The prince's tale was Best part of the movie. they used ""Dumbledore's farewell"" Done by Nicoles Hooper for Half blood prince.Which was the best move in the movie. I had tears in my eyes during the whole tale.When Snape's picks Lily in his hand and cries and baby potter had tears in his eyes. hats Off David Yates and JKR! The forest scene and the Meeting with Dumbledore were perfectly done. The final battle was too Good. Better than it was explained in book. Some complain saying he didn't give the speech to Voldemort which was in the book. But they already showed us that in Prince's tale,So what more you expect critic's? The Epilogue scene was too cute to be left off! When harry says to his son about being in Slytherin Almost had tears in eyes. And it ended. Its Unbelievable how these movies Influenced in our lives. Well I'm sad that it ended,but equally happy that it ended in such a high note. As a very wise woman said last week, 'no story lives unless someone wants to listen ∂? the stories we love best do live in us forever. So whether you come back by page or by the big screen ∂?

30912,tt0133093,A-Dawg,united states,10,Boy oh boy.," Well gee. I'm not really a fickle person. I like most of the movies that I see, and I actually enjoy most movies with Keanu Reeves (woah, it's true). Still, I was somewhat more excited to see this film more than others. And what can I say, two days later, I saw it again. See this film. Please? It was great. I can't help but tell everyone that I know that they just have to see this film! It was more than just a movie. It really captured my imagination, and made me THINK about it over and over until I had no choice but to see it again just to feed my aching cerebrum. The acting was great. Reeves and Fishburne made an amazing duo, and all of the other characters really helped to bring it together, as well. The choreography was top notch - those fighting scenes are breathtaking, especially since you can see that the actors themselves are the ones doing all the insane punching and kicking. The special effects... whew. Being someone who wants to go into sfx for a career, I will usually see any sfx enhanced movie just for that (I actually enjoyed Godzilla... albeit mildly, and Lost in Space made me drool, as much as other people seemed to not like it). The Matrix new exactly what was needed. That ""time slice"" effect seems to be highly overdone as of late, and whoever invented it is rolling in the dough, but it was really well used here, and I think added to the story. I feel that the characters' abilities to warp reality were shown this way. The effect made it seem as though they moved so fast that time had to be slowed so the audience could see what was happening, or sometimes that the characters could actually slow time in order to do some of their stunts. Whatever the case - I thought it worked. The story was so neat! When I think about this film in hindsight, it's as if this film was a REALLY good comic book that was turned into a REALLY good film. I could visualize every single scene being re-done into a Todd McFarlane epic. I'll bet that something not far from that actually happens. In the end, if other people react as I do to this film, it will be a big money maker, probably spawn lots of paraphernalia, goods, more movies, WHO KNOWS? It may not top Star Wars (that's a movie that I will camp out to see), but it sure kept my mouth watering and will keep my brain at ease as I wait for May 19th.   "

62042,tt1853728,adbrown100,united states,1,"An obnoxious, racist screed of pre-civil war history","Quentin Tarantino needs to undergo some serious rehab before directing another movie. This movie was as racist as it gets with the gratuitous use of the N word and the over-hyped violence of white men torturing and killing black men and black men taking vengeance on white men. Historically, the film is schizophrenic jumping from what appears to be the 1880s in the mountainous West, right down to the costumes and the weapons to the ol' southern plantation life of the pre-civil war twenty five-years earlier. (With shots of hilly California thrown in for good measure.) The only saving grace of this movie is Christoph Waltz as the German bounty hunter and Jamie Foxx looking uncomfortable on horseback. For the life of me, I don't understand what prompted Leon DiCaprio to take part in this fraud.  "
39896,tt0120815,addaam78-1,slovenia,10,A war movie which in fact is poetry,"I usually watch and give credit to European movies and usually hate the Hollywood production. And I usually see a political statement in ""Schindlers list"" which is commonly quoted as ""his best movie"" and ""the best movie about holocaust"". However... after seeing S.P.R. I must agree that this is, if probably not the ""best movie ever made"", the most ""revolutionary war movie of all time"". The movie structure is like a poem. It shakes you in the beginning, it calms you in the middle and it destroys you in the end verses. First of all... the first battle on Omaha beach... the moving camera... the embed-ed reporter like camera... following the soldiers to the beach... the explosions, arms, legs torn apart, the fear on soldiers faces... the numbness... the on-and-off going sound after the bombs go off... MAN! After seeing it for the first time... I went out of the movie theater... and went to see it again for the second time! There has never been a movie that glued me to the chair... and made me stare for 25 minutes in silence! Well, that was a... romantic experience and I give Spielberg credit for that. The middle of the movie... is exactly the opposite of the first. It's not loud and disturbing... but silent and green. I must say it's the greenest grass I have seen in a war movie... the soldiers walk and walk and speak about stupid stuff... like they never went thru hell in the landing at Omaha beach. When I watched this middle section I almost felt good, but it felt very unnatural... and that's why after the assault on the MG-42 nest... I felt shaken again. The dying red cross soldier shot in the stomach... dying... in the arms of comrades... UFFF. Some disturbing images. And of course... the last part... the total destruction, the panzer's rolling thru the streets, the sniper... the self-made sticky bombs... the ruble of houses, the fights one on one... wow. Some serious sequences... I admired the photography, the clean pictures, however it is the moving camera that makes this movie revolutionary... I think no director is able to make again a credible war movie without the Spielberg's moving camera... and that's why I consider him a GENIUS. I haven't seen a war movie with static cameras after S.P.R came out. I must say that this movie can be judged in many ways... you can always see a ""shallow characterization"" or even a demagogic view on the Jew-German combat in the house... of course. However... if I exclude my political view of this movie I would say that this is probably one of the best I have ever seen. Only the Russian movie ""Come and See"" (orig. Idi i Smotri) made even a harder impact on my view on what war is. And that's why I consider Saving Private Ryan if not the best, then second best war movie ever made.  "
136179,tt0107290,AdderCowley,united kingdom,9,A groundbreaking classic film adaptation,"Jurassic Park was a pioneering film in a number of ways. Firstly it showed that computer technology was the future of film making, secondly that dinosaurs were not the monsters we perceived them to be and finally that a film can be successfully adapted from a book. Jurassic Park accomplishes these things and more. I was amazed when I first heard this film was originally adapted from a novel. Indeed Jurassic Park is a classic piece of sci-fi fiction, written by respected author Michael Crichton. The book documents man's relationship with nature and his struggle to control it for financial gain. The film itself does follow along this route but deviates for the mainstream audience. Primarily this is a suspenseful thrill-ride rather than a philosophical piece about man's desire to harness the power of nature. There are some parts of the film that explore these ideas but nowhere near the intensity of the book. The movie is quite dissimilar to the book. The characters for example are almost completely different. Alan Grant for example likes children in the book but hates them in the film. Hammond is far more egotistical and manic in the book while characters such as Arnold, Gennaro and Wu barely feature in the movie. Not really a criticism but if for some reason you've never seen the film but read the book then the film doesn't follow the plot to the letter. What really stands out however in this film is not the people but the dinosaurs themselves. For the first time the dinosaurs are perceived as mere animals rather than monsters. Even the predators, the ""villains"" of the film, are forgiven for only ""doing what they got to do"". In that respect the dinosaurs do get a lot of notice in this film. Furthermore Jurassic Park introduces two of the biggest characters in ""monster-movie"" history. The T-Rex and the Velociraptor. Through the great power and size of the T-Rex and the evil, calculating persona of the raptors we find some of the most memorable characters from the ""monster"" genre and also some of my earliest memories of fear. Certainly the kitchen scene and to a lesser extent the T-Rex attack scene are two of the most atmospheric and suspenseful scenes from that time. The kitchen scene in particular is a classic. However Jurassic Park is not just a film that re-introduced the public to dinosaurs, it is also is one of the first movies that pioneered CGI on the screen. For the first time a film was shot with CGI being a major part in the make up rather than just being a shiny extra. This means that Jurassic Park was an pivotal moment in film history and one of the most important film from the 90s. Certainly from a technological point of view. However this is not just a film that relies on technology to pass it by. It does have heart. Spielberg does put emotion into the movie. The scene with the Brachiosaur and the landscape with the herbivores is a beautiful piece of cinema. So to is the music which helps ratchet up the tension but appropriately creates a sense of melancholy and reflection when needed. Combined with the CGI this gives the film excellent production values and really hammers the idea home that these are sentient creatures not Godzilla like monsters. So in conclusion Jurassic Park, while being a simple monster film on the surface, is so much more at heart. It is a film that helped pave the way for CGI, gave audiences some of the most memorable pieces of cinema in history, while making the excellent novel palatable on the big screen. A groundbreaking classic.  "
64602,tt0910970,AdderCowley,hong kong,10,Amazingly endearing and entertaining,"Wall-E is a film which will surpass the highest expectations, entertain the most critical of critics and most importantly stir the stoniest of hearts with its subtle emotion and superb animation. It is a film which is a benchmark for all animated films and kids films for years to come... Wall-E contains possibly one of the most endearing characters in cinema history, ironically a small waste-disposal robot left on earth for 700 years. What this immediately brings is sympathy to a character which would not usually endear audiences. However the subtle use of animation in the eyes and movements of Wall-E an incredibly lovable character. His appreciation of nature only further highlights this. Indeed the impact of Wall-E is so profound that the film needs little dialogue to win the hearts of the audience. In the first 30 minutes, in a similar vein to other animation benchmarks such as Wallace and Gromit, there is little dialogue whatsoever between any of the characters. This again highlights the mastery of pixar which is able to create a character not from words but from actions. This of course leads to the importance of the animation. Wall-E is one of the most visually spectacular animated films presently. With the dusty, rust covered Wall-E, the beautiful sequence of Wall-E in space skimming his hand in the ice rings of a planet and the clinical appearance of the axion human ship, Wall-E is a sensational film, and one could be tricked into thinking that the animation is the centre piece of the film, similar to Finding Nemo. However the focus is not on the animation, Pixar have already proved they can pull off realism but what the film is all about is a love relationship between two completely different characters. WALL-E, a sentimental outdated rubbish collector, and EVE a futuristic vegetation scanner. This awkward relationship is especially interesting because put simply both characters are robots and supposedly emotionless. However Pixar pulls off an emotional story line with Wall-E winning over the heart of his love interest, EVE, as well as inspiring the human race to return to Earth. Is there a more poignant and successful technique to show the power of compassion in cinema today? Indeed Wall-E is a film which ranks up with some of the best Pixar films to date. That is saying something when claiming a film is better than Toy Story or Finding Nemo. However Wall-E very much takes a different angle than these animation giants. While TS and FN were trying to prove that computer animation could be pulled off in varying degrees of complexity, one could argue that Wall-E is the first time Pixar has looked to focus on the characters of the plot rather than the animation. I believe for the first time Pixar has been able to focus on the story rather than the animation. Not to say that the animation is poor, obviously it is brilliant, but Pixar has gone for a new angle in Wall-E, and it has very much worked. Thus Wall-E is about the entertainment of the audience rather than trying to impress us with animation. Indeed the animation is spectacular but if anything the character of Wall-E is more so.   "

The action & suspense kept me wanting to watch more & more! Although it was rather long, i wouldn't have wanted it to be any shorter. It was the perfect length of time. They sequenced it so well, it couldn't be any better. Although my legs went numb near the ending, i wouldn't have stayed for any other movie but i did for this one. The story is so fascinating, you want to know everything, but the great thing about the LOTR, it keeps you interested for the next movie to come out! The best thing about the LOTR is that you get a good feel for the character. Such as when something wrong happens, you feel sad for the character, this is what makes the movie so great! You feel the character's emotions. The jumping back & forth between Frodo & Aragron made it very easy to follow. You understood it once they got to the big fight scene. In the beginning, it was hard to understand how Frodo & Sam fitted in, like what they were trying to do. But the creature that kept saying precious made them all tie together. These are my opinions on the LOTR, the best movie of the year!  "

Batman Begins is without any doubt the best Batman-movie, and that's coming from a big Tim Burton fan. He managed to let the audience watch the movie without thinking of the horrible movie the came before it. He goes his own, new ways in making Batman Begins and made, like I said, a masterpiece which I don't think can ever be matched (That is, in making Batman movies). I hope they will make another movie with Nolan. He has restored my faith in the Batman movies. Batman is my favorite hero and I would just like to thank Christopher Nolan for make this movie.

72693,tt0082096,addicott,united states,10,One of the best films of ANY genre!,"When movies are at their best, they can take the viewer completely into a different world. Watching this movie again, I felt very much transported. It seems unfair to call this a submarine movie because it is so much better rendered than any other offering from that genre. Das Boot transcends all the necessary clich«∏s and tells an amazing story in an incredibly convincing way. In this rare instance, the writers understand that the truth is plenty fascinating, with no need for exaggerated action or melodrama. Technically, this film is a marvel. The camera work is astounding, most of it done hand-held in a real submarine environment where it's hard enough to move, let alone shoot a movie. What special effects there are blend in so seamlessly, it's hard to imagine how they could have made this picture without putting the cast in harm's way. It's a delight to see the director's cut which feels very natural in its pacing. There are long, slow sections which are not boring to watch, but they effectively illustrate what the crew has to endure as they wait weeks on end for some real action. When the action finally comes, the buildup is tremendous. Few movies match Das Boot's dynamic range. All the technical and dramatic devices are in perfect harmony with the human element. One quickly forgets how this crew is fighting for Hitler's Third Reich. They're really just a bunch of kids, lead by a jaded captain. Their ordeal becomes so severe, it's impossible not to have sympathy for them. Because of this, Das Boot should be ranked among the very best of all war films.  "
123743,tt0266697,addicott,united states,10,Tremendous fun!!,"Let me just get one thing out there: this movie kicks ass!!! That thought repeated through my head many times as I leaned back in my seat, eyebrows raised, and took in the film for the first time. There is little in the way of emotional attachment. That might be for the best. While you can certainly empathize at times, Uma Therman's character ""The Bride"" (a.k.a. Black Mamba) seems mighty grim as she pursues a quest of revenge against her former colleagues. The plot, like the title, is laughable. Black Mamba gets ambushed on her wedding day. She survives, drafts a hit list 5 names long and sets out to get her revenge. So how could such a simple storyline with limited emotional involvement turn into 3 hours worth of sheer movie bliss? Quentin Tarantino wrote and directed it, that's how! The genius is in the details. There's an abundance of nasty surprises that will challenge your tolerance and keep you wide awake. The slower interludes are loaded with tension, intrigue and humor. No one's lovable, but everyone is memorable. Uma Thurman is terrific in the lead. You see her character from a few different aspects. Usually she's nasty and pitiless. Occasionally she's cute. At one point she has an outburst of grief that's pretty riveting. Lucy Liu is great as O-ren Ishi, the boss of the Tokyo underworld. While obviously lethal, she somehow maintains this beautifully elegant, almost fragile presence, all decked out in her kimono. Her henchmen are colorful and imposing, like the earlier James Bond heavies. Bill (David Carradine) is genuinely mysterious, all the more so because they haven't shown his face yet. And then there's the action. The combat is phenomenal in its execution and mind-numbing in its scope. Just when you think that has GOT to be it, they keep piling it on. One sequence is the new Mt. Everest of Kung Fu. Seriously. That alone is more than enough to keep this film on the map. Be warned: it's not harmless Jackie Chan-style slapstick combat. The blood and gore is overwhelming. As you would expect, the music selections are devastatingly cool, and they come from all over the map. There's '70s funk. Pan flute w/ orchestra. Tex Mex. A Japanese schoolgirl power trio. You name it∂? It's not just the music that's eclectic. Kill Bill is a very vivid fusion of American, Chinese and Japanese genres. (At least these are the most visible elements ∂? bear in mind that Tarantino seems to have seen every movie ever made anywhere.) The Japanese settings are stunning, and there's an entire segment beautifully done in a Japanese animation style called anime. This degree of savvy and reverence for the region is extremely rare among Western filmmakers. All these elements are combined with great virtuosity to form a supremely entertaining movie thrill ride. You never know what's going to hit next, but whatever it is, it is likely to saturate the senses and challenge the brain. I didn't want for it to end, but I must admit: that level of intensity for 3 whole hours would be a bit much. So I can understand why they split it into two installments. Some people bitch about the severance, but I enjoyed volume 1 enough to see it twice and I can't wait to go shell out more dough and see volume 2. Most American action films indulge in their gratuitous carnage behind a veil of contrived morality. This has come to irritate me enough to turn me off the genre. One thing I find very refreshing in Kill Bill is the absence of such pretense. It's all thrills and spills; no apologies, no disguises, no lectures. Critics who object to this film seem to do so because it fails to pander to their various expectations. Here's a little news flash, people: it's Quentin Tarantino. If you go in expecting a repetition of his previous work or a movie that is in any way conventional and/or predictable, you're going to be disappointed ∂? and you deserve to be. I went expecting something bold, exciting and original, with plenty of violence and a few surprises. I couldn't have been more delighted.  "

I would usually pick a ""director's cut"" in a heartbeat, but with this director, maybe a ""studio-mandated cut"" could be a good thing. PTA always gets off to a roaring start and this film is no exception! I found the first three quarters to be utterly fascinating. The silver mining scenes established a sense of toil like nothing else I've ever seen. The desert landscape becomes a potent if silent character. And the score was very refreshing (in a bleak, psychotic sort of way). For 2 hours, I was transported. HERE""S THE SPOILER I really didn't care for the epilogue. It seemed disjointed, melodramatic and redundant. Daniel beating Eli to death seemed to me like a metaphor for the storyteller beating this story to death. OKAY, Danny's a sociopath, WE GET IT!! Don't get me wrong. I'm still a Paul Thomas Anderson fan and Daniel Day-Lewis was undeniably superb. The film was exceptional but not iconic in the way so many reviewers would have one believe.  "

This movie depicts the life of an underdog who just wanted to achieve success in his life. He wanted to show everybody that he had the potential to become the greatest fighter and wasn't just another bum from the neighbourhood. This movie truly inspires me and millions of other people around the world. ""Never give up"". This movie boosted my confidence and encouraged me to follow my dreams. The other rocky sequels are awesome as well. I think if someone is about to give up something and he watches this movie, he would definitely stand up and follow his dreams. The drama,romance,action has been perfectly set in the movie and sly has successfully succeeded in inspiring many people through his portrayal of the character of rocky.  "
3907,tt0068646,Addie T,united states,10,my favorite gangster movie ever.,"THIS HAS A SPOILER IN IT!!!! DO NOT READ UNLESS YOU HAVE SEEN IT!!!!!!  I just saw this movie a couple of weeks ago, and i loved it. I had heard so much hype about it, and that it was the greatest movie ever, so I was skeptical. I was not disappointed; except when Sonny died, that just ruined my day. He was my favorite. This movie has everything that a good drama needs.  Actors: Everyone that had a role of significance, played it to a tee. I never noticed any moments of ""I can't believe he just said that. This is like CSI:Miami.""   Characters: This movie got you to root for basically the ""bad guys"". It portrays them in a way that makes you feel that they are just like your family, they just happen to kill people for a living. They were all dynamic and interesting, and you couldn't really just classify them as the good or bad guy.   Filming/technicalities: Their lighting was the one thing that I actually noticed about the technical aspect. They always had innocent events out in broad daylight, but when a bad guy came on, or something dark was going on, it was almost always concealed in the shadows. Normally I don't really care about those types of things, but it gave the movie a nice effect. "
53835,tt0172495,Addie-7,united states,9,"An old-fashioned hero, brilliantly portrayed"," There isn't much I can add that hasn't already been said, but what made this movie so special for me was Russell Crowe's brilliant portrayal of Maximus as a genuine hero of Shakespearean proportions. I don't mean to imply that there is any resemblance between Gladiator and one of Shakespeare's plays, or that the dialogue resembles one of them. But the creation of a truly heroic character in a pivotal role is a classical and, unfortunately, out of date device. It requires an actor who can not only convince you that his character possesses a heroic and noble nature, but who can also make you care terribly about what happens to this hero. Crowe does both. The viewer loves and admires his Maximus, and agonizes with him in his travails. In this, Crowe reminded me of Laurence Olivier at a comparable age, although I'd guess he would cringe at the comparison. As to the rest of the cast, I couldn't find a single weak link. In fact, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the extent of the gore in the battle and gladiator scenes. I can't believe that so many prolonged grisly scenes were necessary to get the movie's point across.   "
7197,tt0468569,Addieo,united kingdom,7,The First One Was Better! Not saying it was bad though!,"I attended the movie last night in a crowded screen where everyone was literally hugging each other. Shows what advertising does for the film seen as the first one was such a undercover success. Before I start I'm not showing any disrespect to the late Heath or any other character in this film I am just presenting my opinion on why the hype didn't compare. In the first film we see Gotham presented as a dark city corrupt under the power of its Mob and this is emphasised where ever we go in the city. Almost the whole movie was shot in a sort of shroud of eeriness to represent the bad and evil around (great piece of cinematography). In DK (Dark Knight) we see the city very bright and almost looks like this bad has been rid of. Which I can believe as a good thing because as we find the city is being cleaned up by Harvey Dent. It just doesn't look like it was meant to be for that though. Oh and where was the proper Wayne Tower from the first one because as far as I can remember it was in tact when we left the first one be. Now on to characters, first Christian Bale, I think Christian is a very talented actor from seeing him in other undercover success' such as The Prestige, The Machinist and of course Batman Begins. I simply thought that we didn't see enough of him in this film, with him being the protagonist I thought we were not as close to him as in Batman Begins. It was almost as though we were watching from a different perspective all together. Maggie Gyllenhaal I've got to say I was so happy when she died in this film, I decided to give her chance when it first started but she did not suck me in to the character of Rachel Dawes like Katie Holmes did and I was disappointed to hear she had other arrangements when she was asked to appear in this. Aaron Eckhart who played Harvey Dent I thought played the villain two face a lot better than he did Dent, he seemed to make the two face character his own, like the touch Heath gave Joker. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman played their parts greatly just like they always do in any film I've ever seen, there parts fit them so well as well. Both coming out with their useful comments every now and again to help push the Dark Crusader onwards, sort of like the agony aunts of Batman. Finally coming to the late Heath Ledger I suppose seen as I could not believe that it was him under that paint that he must of done a pretty good job...I think though that some people are being (whats the word), well their opinion of the film is being blinded by his performance and his death. Gotta have a huge amount of respect for him seen as he was in Lords Of Dogtown and played his part amazingly. Great actor overall and its been a tragedy to lose him so quickly. Now to the storyline. To be honest when I heard that it was two and half hours long I was even more pumped to see it seen as I love long films. The opening bank seen I thought was really good because that is what the joker would do so was very capturing for his character, sort of settled the mood to. Then the rest of the way through the film I felt rushed without a chance to get settled down with what was going on. It felt like an episode of Cribs where the cameras just constantly in a new place (I know a bit OTT but I thought it was funny). I did like how Rachel was killed off in the middle though and not only because she was annoying but because it unravelled a good story line of two face and Bruce taking the pain of his loss and putting it on the side line. Some of the story line was very predictable which I did not enjoy and then some of it was very wild like Harvery as two face. I thought that the two face should of been the ending so that it left it in suspense for the next one. I also thought the Mob were presented as a bit of a wuss crowd in this one especially Eric Roberts who played the Falconey representative, he just seemed like a complete joke compared to Falconey in the last one. Did anyone notice the Gambler as well, they should not waste characters like they did with this plus they made him look rubbish I can always remember him as more of doing guy. Personally it might have been the hype that ruined it for me. Please don't post that missed Heath Ledger as well when you didn't know him. This is why I feel it wasn't great if you agree with some of the ideas I posted, post it as helpful if you think I didn't present anything good vote unhelpful...Thanks For Your Time and as if Anthony Michael Hall was in it I didn't realise it was him!

122577,tt0758758,Addieo,united kingdom,10,Thoughts Of The Wild,"Please read the whole of my comment before judging. First off let me start off by stating that this is my most favourite film I have ever seen. I have also read the the book by Jon Krakauer and loved that too. I recommend that you watch the film first. I don't know where exactly my love of this film comes from whether it is my fascination at his love for giving. Maybe it is his will to drop everything for the experience of a life time instead of the same experience most ""normal"" people get in there life of dead ends. The fact that this is a true story makes it even better. Emile Hirsch makes me believe that Chris McCandless was actually like this. He puts his heart and soul in to this performance and you can really see it. His acting his some of the best I've seen him produce, up there with his role of Jay Adams in Lords Of Dogtown. Just from the way people spoke of Chris, Emile shines this image right on through to the screen. I think Vince Vaughn's performance in this is to be commended as well seen as this is the first ""serious"" role I have seen him in and he plays Wayne Westerberg really well. Hats off to Sean Penn for his directing in this film it was a pleasure to watch. Nice to see Jim Gallien playing himself as well. This film is for the more ""open"" film watches. People who are willing to understand that this is a true story and it can't be packed with action every second because that is not the way his or anyone else's lives are. It is a very slow 2 hour film but this time if not more was required to set the relationship between the viewer and Chris/Emile and to tell his tale in full. I am captivated with this film/book and Chris McCandless' life I hope you like it too. My dream one day is to go to Alsaka but unlike many people I shall be taking a map and a compass and maybe even a guide. I don't know about you but I want to visit Fairbanks 142.

151555,tt0325980,AddieS,united states,7,Enjoyable Summer Flick," I took my 14 year old son and his friend to see this movie. It was an enjoyable, but predictable flim. The story was fairly interesting but tended to drag in places. I felt it would have been better if about 20 minutes had been deleted. Johnny Depp was very engaging as Capt. Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly were appealing in their roles as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Geoffrey Rush gave a very solid performance. Good flim to see with your younger teen family members.  "
42258,tt0120586,addiewhiz,united states,7,Edward Norton is the saving grace for this film,"On my gallant, noble, and impossible quest to see every movie that has ever been deemed to be good, I happened on the title American History X. It was indeed a good film, but that's just it. It was only a good film. It did not give me chills or astound me like many of the other great films that I have seen. The most wonderful aspect of this film was the acting. When I heard what the film was about, and that Edward Norton was going to play the raving Neo-Nazi brother Derek Vinyard, I was initially disappointed, due to Norton's style of largely plain and deadpan delivery. I didn't think he had it in him to play a raving, deluded racist. I am glad to say that Norton's performance proved me very wrong. The way in which he delivered his lines was so convincing, that I actually experienced some amount of anger at his character, and not just the ideas he espoused. The convoluted logic behind his racism was so thought out and realistic, that it made it very easy to see how people who hold racial prejudices come to hold them. In addition, Ethan Suplee demonstrated impressive versatility in his acting. The first time I saw Suplee in a film was in Remember the Titans, where he played the slightly comical offensive lineman Louie Lastik. His character in this film, Seth, was incredibly dark, singing his White Supremacist songs and saluting Hitler. In general, the acting absolutely blew me away. The downside to this movie is that the plot sets itself up for much depth in the story, but never takes the dive. In the beginning, Danny's teacher tells Danny that he will be a part of a new class, called American History X, designed to prevent him from going down the same Nazi path as his older brother. This is the title of the film. I think it's fair to expect the film to go into significant depth as to what the substance of the class is, and what Danny would have been learning in the class. But, because of the nature of the film, we never find out. I'm not saying that the film should be changed. I'm just saying that the writers of the film should have made it such that Danny was just given an extra assignment by his teacher, as opposed to having an entirely new course constructed for him. Another aspect that goes undeveloped is the nature of the character, Lamont, who is Derek's Black friend in prison. Lamont is largely responsible for Derek's epiphany that Black people are, in fact, treated unfairly by law enforcement, and further more that racial hatred is a wasteful way of life. With such an important role in the story, one would think that Lamont's character would have been better explained. Instead, we never learn anything about him, other than the reason that he is in prison. Another large missing link in this story is the reason for Derek's racism. In Danny's paper, he writes that Derek claims his racism was rooted in his father's murder. Danny claims to believe that his hatred for non-Whites began at an earlier age, when his father told him about affirmative action policies. The film introduces this question, which seems to be a large and significant question, but really only spends about five minutes answering it. The final large missing puzzle piece, which is a problem that is slightly difficult to solve it whether or not Derek reverts to a life of racism at the end of the film. Not to spoil the film completely, but something happens to Danny at the very end of the film that would force Derek to question what he had learned from his experiences in prison. But, the film simply leaves us hanging there. We do not know whether we should feel happy or sad, for Derek, at the end of this film, when we feel the need to feel some sort of emotion in that regard. There really isn't a way to solve this problem, but it is worth noting. Overall, this is a good film, with excellent character portrayal. However, it definitely leaves some questions unanswered.  "
80460,tt0056172,addiewhiz,united states,10,Simply the Best!,"I have had the privilege of watching some of the greatest films ever made. However, of all of those films, none have been quite able to match the simply magnificent splendor of ""Lawrence of Arabia"". I strongly believe that this is the greatest film ever made. I'll begin with the dialog. Every conversation and line of dialog in this film is so precisely crafted and so memorable. The film begins by showing how the title character, Thomas Edward Lawrence dies. At his funeral, a reporter is walking around talking to various characters that will later be shown to be of significance in the story. Two of these characters are British Generals Murray and Allenby. Both of them claim to have not known him well. This scene perfectly sets the stage for the story. A story about a man who was mysterious, strange and seldom understood by those around him, particularly his peers in the British Army. The director, Sir David Lean, also does an excellent job in casting each and every one of the characters, especially the main character, T.E. Lawrence himself. Peter O'Toole's portrayal of Lawrence is absolutely spectacular, as he is able to make it such that Lawrence's behavior and actions are uniquely in tune with his circumstances, while still transcending all of it. If I were to go into how amazing the casting of the other characters is as well, this review would go well beyond the IMDb word limit. One of the most striking elements of this film is the cinematography. Not many films are this successful at immersing the audience into the environment of the story. The spectacular views of the desert in this film make the viewer feel as though they are going through this adventure with Lawrence, and make the entire experience feel so much more real. I could go on, but I feel that a review about this films many strengths would take far too long.  "
107103,tt1291584,addiewhiz,united states,9,One of the best films of the year!,"Now, you may be asking yourself why I declared this to be one of the best films of the year, but gave it a nine out of ten. Not to worry. I do not give out many tens. I reserve those for movies that I deem to be some of the best movies of all time. Nevertheless, upon hearing about this film, I was worried that it would simply be a low-quality rehashing of ""The Fighter"". When I finally saw this film, I was pleasantly surprised and extremely impressed with everything that they had done. ""Warrior"" is not just another sports movie that portrays an individual or a team overcoming great odds and finally reaching victory on a high level. This story has multiple layers and satisfies on multiple levels. This is a story about three characters, two of whom are MMA fighters and one of whom is their father. It portrays how a fighting championship called Sparta brings a family together after they have become strangers to each other. The two sons, Tommy and Brendan Conlon, feel they have been neglected by their father, Paddy, for their entire lives, due to his drinking problem, while the brothers have become distant as Brendan has started a family while Tommy joined the Marines. Tommy feels that Brendan betrayed him by not joining the Marines with him, while Brendan is disappointed that when distancing himself, Tommy also distanced their mother from him. On top of this, Tommy is fighting to earn money for the family of a fallen comrade, while Brendan is trying to earn money for his wife and children so that they don't have to face foreclosure. All of this comes together seamlessly to build one of the greatest sports films ever made. Much of the poetic beauty of this film comes together in how the brothers Brendan and Tommy are portrayed as perfect foils of each other. Brendan plays the guy who is settled down and mature, while Tommy plays the rogue Bad Boy who likes to break all the rules and goes against the grain. The makers of this film make this theme play out on several different levels, from the way in which the brothers walk, talk and behave, to the style in which they train and fight. They even go as far as having Joel Edgerton, who plays Brendan, wear white shorts during his fights, and having Tom Hardy, who plays Tommy, wear black shorts. The way in which all of this came together reminded me very much of how, in ""Black Swan"", the characters Nina and Lily, where perfect foils of each other. I must say that, in this respect, this was done just as well. The other point I enjoyed about this movie is that the audience doesn't know how this story is going to end like in just about every other sports movie. When you began watching ""Remember the Titans"", you knew that the movie could only end with the Titans winning the state championship. In ""Coach Carter"", the Oilers failed to win the championship, and while the film makers tried their best to make the best out of it while still opting out of the standard sports movie ending, it still ended up being disappointing. The makers of this film eliminated that problem by focusing on two competitors instead of one. At no point during the film did we know which one of the brothers was going to win the final fight, which made it all the more thrilling. My only gripe about this film is a rather small one and does little damage to the film's overall quality. In the beginning of the film, we are lead to believe that the two brothers were once excellent fighters, but have not stepped inside the cage in a very long time. I found it a little difficult to believe that they could become top MMA fighters after only a few months of training. That is really my only criticism for this film, but it really doesn't take away from the rest of the story. My bottom line is: You must definitely see this movie. I loved it even though my interest in MMA fighting is minimal. After some time, I will probably watch it again, and I will probably enjoy it. This movie definitely earns all the praise it gets.  "
157767,tt0848228,addiewhiz,united states,8,Great film to open up the summer,"When I first saw the trailer for The Avengers, I was a little worried that it would just end up being a large special effects feature. Part of this is because this film has so many big name actors who play so many important roles, that one would worry that there would be little character development. However, this film did not fail me, as it kept me on the edge of my seat for all two hours. Despite all of the big names playing big roles, I felt that the characters in this movie all seemed to interact quite well with each other. This is especially true regarding the conflict that arises between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers. Both personalities fit the superhero they belonged to and both were able to interact well with each other. I feel that Joss Whedon was the perfect director for this film as it was very in-keeping with his style. Even in the most action packed scenes, the superheroes managed to crack a few jokes will still seeming as though they were taking the crisis seriously and still sticking to the personality and ethos of their character. This is a modern superhero film, to the standards of the special effects were set quite high early on. This film without question, met those standards. When large objects would collide, it actually looked like the objects had considerable momentum and were striking other objects with considerable force. Along with having a satisfying story, this film is great eye-candy. Such a difficult film, is however, not without a few flaws. First is that Nick Fury is supposed the be a brilliant leader, but with so many big characters, it was difficult for Samuel Jackson's acting to shine through. The other problem is that Loki is supposed to be a brilliant mastermind, but he never acts like it. He simply comes off as a villain who was power-hungry, and in the end was consumed by his own ego. My final problem is one that may possibly explained with more knowledge of the Marvel Universe, but I find it a little difficult to foresee that. All along, Loki's plan inside SHIELD's ship was to make Bruce Banner lose control of himself and become The Hulk. This did in fact happen. However, when in Manhattan, Banner was suddenly able to harness his powers to fight against Loki in a relatively controlled way that involved taking orders from Captain America. I simply do not see how he is loses control in Hulk form in one instance and is able to control himself in another instance. These however are small issues and do not take much away from the overall quality of the movie. The bottom line is that this is definitely a good movie that hopefully preps us for what is about to come soon in The Dark Knight Rises. I intend to see this film again after some time, and I am guessing that I will probably enjoy it.  "

This movie allowed for most Batman fans to finally understand what motivates Bruces' alter ego, rather than seeing an athletic and intelligent man fighting justice. Bruce Waynes' mysterious nature often portrays a persona of greatness that is only rivaled by his actual ability to exert such greatness.So here I want to say, Batman is the best!  "

Some of the other users that have left negative comments seem to be missing the point. Roberto Benigni loves Charlie Chaplin, and knows everything about him. You'd be a fool to go into this movie thinking that you're not going to see things like eggs dropping on heads, people crashing into each other, clothing being ripped, Guido falling over a chair, etc. It's a little sappy, a touch of cheesy, but that's the way he wants it. As for the comments like, ""How could a smart young boy believe this game?"": it's a movie. A story. You all suspend your disbelief and watch the BS that happens in action and horror movies, so, why not give a sweet story like this a chance? You're right to say that children and other folks should read in books about the actual horrors of the Holocaust. This movie is not supposed to be an ""educational film"". Your kids go to school for that. You go into it knowing that it's a ""tragicomedy"". If you send your kids to a movie nowadays in order to really teach them something, you've got problems.

I Also felt the Tension between Alfred and Bruce Wayne. Catwoman in this film was excellent, She was best Catwoman ever seen on film. Anne Hathaway did an excellent job portraying Catwoman. Nolan's Catwoman fit the catwoman of the comics to a T. The Ending of this film is the Best part of the movie. The Ending made me well up tears in my eyes, I Felt for Bruce Wayne/Batman in that scene. In my mind I Was like no this can't be. I Almost cried watching that scene. In the history that I have been to theaters and watched movies, no movie has ever come close to even making me cry, Much less a comic book film. But this movie Almost Did it. I Refrained from crying after being relieved from the very last scenes of the movie. This movie almost made me cry, And for that I Give a 10 out of 10.  "
83664,tt0093058,adeck14,united states,10,war is hell,"WARNING: this review may contain spoilers Full Metal Jacket is by far one of my favorite war movies. This movie, in my opinion is very much anti-war. Upon entering boot camp, the soldiers are still normal in the sense that they have not been stripped of their individuality. However,as we see with Sgt. Hartman's statements like, ""You're not even human f-ing beings"" and ""you are all equally worthless,"" the marines are not made up of a group of individuals: they are a part of a mean, lean, fighting machine. To become a part of this machine, the soldier has to be dehumanized. As we see in the film, the soldiers are subject to strict, systematic instruction that is supposed to bring about a methodical obedience. In this context, even the most harmless of men can become ruthless killers. This says a lot about human nature in general: we use violence to survive, or obtain peace and security. While this may be the ultimate goal and purpose of the military and war, Full Metal Jacket does a great job at painting a very different picture. The soldiers leave boot camp ready to fight and kill. Raptor Man complains about not having to shoot his gun at all after 2 years of being in Vietnam. Other soldiers boast about how many kills they have had. It becomes clear that these soldiers are not fighting for honor, liberty, or whatever we are told by our government (at least in this context). They are doing what they are trained to do (or, as the logo says on Joker's helmet, ""Born to Kill""). They are trained to kill the enemy, and all Vietnamese are seen as the enemy. The Vietnamese are not seen as human beings, which is made apparent when the soldier in the helicopter shoots at innocent civilians. While I realize this is not the case for every soldier, it does coincide with the whole idea of ""war is hell."" This is the picture Stanley Kubrick is trying to paint for us: war is hell, seemingly normal men are capable of committing atrocities against other human beings, and this is all in the name of∂?∂?∂?what? I give this movie 10 out of 10. This movie is a must-see for fans of all genres. The acting, script, and cinematography is amazing!  "

I liked it's comments on crappy low pay jobs and mindless life sucking jobs and soul-killing ethic suspect jobs related to insurance...who said ""you expect me to hand over my brain for your use for the entire day and expect me to think it will be returned in an unmutilated condition!?""?

127463,tt0074896,adeel5,pakistan,8,A Must See- especially in these difficult times,"I saw this film again after a span of almost 25 years and was as impressed as I was back then. Superb acting, excellent re-creations and un-matched visuals. The content and its presentation is in a class of its own and it's a pity that politics did not allow the proper running of this movie when it was first released. In the light of the serious misunderstandings and disagreements that have created fissures between the Muslims and the Western Powers, I believe it is a MUST for this film to be re-released. In fact someone should take on the task and make a sequel to it, as a salute to Moustapha Akkad, a legend of his time.  "

As was the case with the former two parts, this one is again a movie that has it all: story, actors, characters, emotion, action, scenery, music, effects, cinematography... Everything wonderfully done with great respect for the viewer, whether that one read LOTR or not. You can't comment on ROTK alone, you have to see the movies as a whole. And in that light LOTR is without any doubt the future classic motion picture for the twenty-first century (and beyond). I don't think I will enjoy cinema this much in all the years to come, unless I lower my standards. Fantastic.  "
28067,tt0167261,Adeir,belgium,10,"Dump all the cynical critics, this movie's just great!"," Here in Belgium, lots of movie critics were not satisfied with this film. I don't know what they expected instead, maybe they're just prejudiced. Anyway, it's a must see. It's how the story had to continue to stay true to the book and at the same time be a compelling movie in itself. It's no longer a simple straightforward tale from North to south anymore, the plot thickens, the evil manifests itself more openly and despair grows. The careless Shire is long behind us, it's for real this time. The Aragorn-Arwen thing might be boring to some, but they're forgetting that their story formed a whole appendix in Tolkien's work, so it belongs in the major story. Besides, it explains the tough choice Arwen must make, just like any other character in the movie, they all have to realize the good old times will never return. But for me the best part in the whole movie was Gollum. Sweet, deceitful, tragic Gollum. You can't help feeling sorry for him. His voice, his expression, his dialogues with Smeagol, it all makes him one of the most complex and interesting characters of them all. It's just great how they created him, and developed his character so thoroughly in this piece of cinema with an over 30 man strong cast. And for anyone who dislikes it, I'd like to see YOU get those millions of dollars from the studios and make something better. This what you got, and it's worth every damn penny. Counting down from now till December 2003, with hopefully an excellent extended dvd version to keep us sweet in between.  "

Kill Bill vol. 1 has its fine moments, though never really memorable. The fight scenes are quite gory and over the top, but not truly shocking nor are they genuinely funny in their wackiness. The characters are rather flat and most of the times recite dull lines in boring dialogue. I don't know what to make of this film, because the ambitions are unclear. If it was to show the audience what a great actress Uma Thurman is, then the least they could to was to give some more depth to her character. Now she's just a cold, vengeful killer in yellow leather with a katana blade. I remained completely neutral towards The Bride throughout the whole film. Did Tarantino want to show how well he could write a screenplay on his own? He falls short. The story never comes alive, not even with the little - rather predictable - twist at the very end of vol. 1. I definitely will go and see vol. 2, but only to watch the end of the story with my own eyes instead of having other people tell me. The fate of the Bride and Bill doesn't affect me one bit, and that's something I regret. Parts that are very OK though: the sunglasses on the dashboard, the anime part and the bickering between Hattori Hanzo and his assistant.  "

44405,tt0816692,Adel Radwan,egypt,10,My observations about Nolan's masterpiece Interstellar,"Using the name Mann to refer to humans' weakness which only leads to failure and destruction as doctor Mann did in the movie then opposing it with Cooper's sacrifice detaching himself form Endurance the main space ship to help doctor Brand to reach Edmund's planet as it was the last hope for mankind, this sacrifice led him to the impossible to the resolution and to the knowledge that saved the mankind on earth. Embedding the docking scene which came after doctor Mann's failure to explain - in a very simple yet breath taking scene - Relativity and all the unbelievable scientific facts used in the movie - like time relativity between Earth and the first planet the crew landed on - by showing the audience how Cooper ordered TARS to spin the ship to match with Endurance's spinning and when that happened in a second the two ships looked like they stopped moving because they are relatively not moving to each other every body knows that but to embed this scene in the movie is a pure brilliance. The noble conflict of the movie tells us that we are seeking glory and luxury by industry, researching and hi-tech destroying our planet in the process ignoring that in someday Earth will payback punishing us for forgetting about our basic needs and our sol purpose which is improving Earth God's gift for us to survive but we are only trying to improve our creations forgetting about God's creations.

Thank Warner Bros. for letting Nolan make such a smart, thrilling, emotionally involving, just terrifically well rounded and fully realized entertainment that challenges and elevates notions of what a so-called 'summer blockbuster' can do. The movie is almost perfect. Outstandingly acted and perfectly directed by Chris Nolan.

The only realistic holes are not wormholes nor black holes but the gaping holes in the storyline. How come Hollywood these days always seems to take fascinating science fiction-themes and mangle them into some commercial junk that is all about fiction and has not the slightest thing to do with science? Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" is still light years ahead of the rest of the pack, almost 50 years since that brilliant film was created. Don't waste your money on this farce but buy a good book instead and create your own space-time adventure on your comfortable couch at home.  "
149522,tt0072890,AdemWeldon (ademweldon@gmail.com),united states,9,Authentic Melodrama.," (some spoilers) Ultimately, the audience has a tough time deciding what genre Dog Day Afternoon belongs with. The storyline is very slow paced, but the subtleties in action and humor that progress the story are very strong contributing elements. As with many of his films, Lumet takes a very even-handed approach to telling tales. This strategy clearly began with 12 Angry Men as nearly the entire film takes place at one location. Both films easily take advantage of the audiences' desire to alleviate tension from time to time. Though Dog Day Afternoon is ultimately a crime-drama, it dabbles relentlessly in comedy. Naivety is initially displayed when Sonny and Sal begin the heist. After the film progresses, it is clear that Sal maintains this characteristic to support contrast between leader and follower. The film also incorporates a healthy amount of absurdism through Sonny's first wife Leon. There is nothing more surprising or shocking in this film. The subject matter is bewildering yet intriguing, its application is upbeat and non-partisan, and the effect is hilarious but poignant. Ironically, one of the film's most dramatic scenes is the (improvised) telephone conversation between the two former lovers. This particular sequence earned Chris Sarandon a Best Supporting Actor nomination for the 1976 Academy Awards. Finally, exhibitionism exercises the audiences' right to sympathize with the men. Our perspective is echoed in the mobs outside the bank. These individuals have decided to support the determined (but socially detached) thieves. The public seems eager for the spectacle to unfold, yet they rally against law enforcement and instantly assimilate their influence into the conflict. A good look at the consequences of stupidity. ***1/2 (of ****)   "

Luckily, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was the perfect remedy for those tired of the cheesy lines and lackluster effects. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind brought back the idea that film should be art, and not computer generated special effects. The film itself was one of most ingenious works of art I ever saw. The acting was magnificent, the editing was stupendous, and photography was imaginative, making it one the best and most memorable films I have ever saw. Very rarely is a film worth eight dollars at the shows, but this one is worth at least ten fold. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the perfect movie for anyone that loves film or poetic literature.

I watched it at his house, having never heard of it before. Now, I was blown away by Norton's performance in Primal Fear but I thought he outdid himself as Derek in American History X Now, I consider myself a great and avid lover of film today but at that time was only familiar with more commercial fare that studios throw tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars into. I just find it unfortunate that regardless of his Oscar nomination, the movie itself reportedly only grossed around $10 million at the box office, meaning it probably got a limited release. If I remember correctly, Scarface was also a bust at the box office. Also, this years Oscar winner for best picture (The Hurt Locker) only had a limited release in theaters and reportedly grossed the least amount in history for a best picture win at the Oscars. It's a shame that these talents get overlooked by the majority of the population.  "
24872,tt1375666,adepu89,india,10,Masterpiece,"The film is a classical thriller and, like many great thrillers it is one that is built on an imaginative and damn-good clever concept. To its credit the stepping up of the action aspect does not mean that the ideas that got us here are abandoned because they are not. The cast deliver well. DiCaprio manages to produce an engaging character who emotionally makes sense and it is his performance that helps the deeper material in his subconscious work well and be more accessible to the viewer. Gordon-Levitt is memorable for his action scenes but he is also a good presence generally even if he has a lot less to do. I'm not in agreement that Inception is a classic perfect film but it is a very good one. If anything the elevation of this film is more to do with how average and uninspiring the vast majority of films released are, but I suppose that the success of this one is a good thing in some ways to maybe counter that. The concept and ideas are well constructed and presented to the audience and the film itself is not hard to follow but does challenge the viewer to do the one thing that a blockbuster normally doesn't ∂? pay attention.

96486,tt0041959,Adfault,united states,8,Worth watching,"Adapted for screen by novelist Graham Greene from the novel of the same title and directed by Carol Reed. Critical acclaim and highly praised by cinephiles and critics as well. The story of these characters is especially engrossing with the way it distinctly embodies the attributes of American film noir. This film was filmed in the U.K and originally released there and then the following year was released in the U.S. Also, the plot moves a little slowly compared to American cinematic film noir but definitely is straightforward in it's execution. Martin and his journey to discovering the truth involving the murder of his friend Harry Lime. It's a story about moral injustice. The narrative is introspective. It attempts draws you into the story of corruption and each of the main character's journey for redemption. Stand out performance goes to Orson Wells who really does a fine job at personifying the character of Harry Lime. I don't know if I wish to provide an in-depth character analysis of Harry Lime because it would give away too much of the plot and my objective of this review focused on a general critique of the film. Our heroes are given just enough interesting qualities to drive the plot forward and keep us interested. Joseph Cotton's performance reminds me of John Wayne. In fact, I think John Wayne could probably been a better fit to play Holly Martins since the portrayal Cotton gives is very much a John Wayne imitation. Orson Wells is only on screen for about a quarter of the film but when he does make an appearance, it's quite memorable in regards to a few scenes. I will not give anything away but you will understand what I mean when that scene occurs. Most people are familiar with Orson Wells from his iconic performance as Charles Foster Kane in the film Citizen Kane which is still regarded as the greatest film ever made. The love interest for both leading men is Anna Schmidt ( Alida Valli). The police regard her as a person of interest and essentially Anna is just trying to make sense of the tragedy just like Martin. Alida's performance reminded me of another great American actress, Ingrid Bergman. She's docile, innocent, and inspires our sympathy. Despite the performances from the actors, the thing that makes this movie really excels is the director Carol Reed. She is able to depict the exact lighting and set up various scenes effective emphasis on certain aspects of story plot whilst also supporting the overall tone and mood. She really has an keen sense of detail. Unfortunately in that year of the Academy Awards of 1951, Carol was up against tough competition (All About Eve, The Asphalt Jungle, Born Yesterday and Sunset Blvd) that if not for that, she would have easily won the award for best director and the the film would have won best black and white cinematography. Ironically enough, the same year this movie was released in UK, most of Hollywood films were of the same genre: film noir, crime drama/mystery with a dash of romance.  "
159074,tt0101414,Adfault,united states,9,One of the best that Disney has to offer.,"There are some very beautiful scenes as well as action sequences that truly drive the plot forward. But those qualities are what we've come to expect from Disney. The only differences is the story. A prince is visited at his castle by a seemingly old beggar woman. She asks him for shelter in exchange for a rose. He denies her request. Well it turns out that the old woman beggar wasn't an old woman at all but a witch! Offended by his rejection she puts a curse on him. What could possibly be wrong with an independent thinker who decides who and when to help? So, there you have a prince who is lonely and rich. After all, many people have probably come to his door asking for favors and how could one person appease the will of many when he doesn't even know their intentions? Perhaps he was having a bad day? When he refuses to help her she turns into an enchantress and puts a curse on him transforming him into a hideous beast. To make matters worst, his curse has a time frame for him to change what she deems is an unattractive trait (unkindness) which requires the prince to learn to love another person and have that love reciprocated. The second act involves the introduction of Belle. Belle is a meek introverted library in an unknown village. She is is a humble woman. Her father, Maurice,smart man, an inventor. However, the setting of this film is not established although it is evident that intelligence and the scientific hobbies of Maurice have earned him a reputation of being crazy from the townspeople especially from a thug named Gaston. Gaston is your typical macho bully who thinks he can woo any woman that he desires just by his sheer masculinity. It really is preposterous idea that the writers take full advantage of with a few cute scenes of Gaston being stupid and his solo musical number later on in the film. Regardless of Gaston's efforts Belle is unimpressed with his bravado, so he devises another plan to win her heart which includes framing poor little Maurice. Belle has to rescue her father and proves his innocents to an angry mob of people that Gaston has riled up. This journey leads her to the Beast's castle and she trades herself for her father's freedom. The third act involves Bellle's time at the enchanted castle trying to live with the bitter, angry Beast and his fun loving yet caring protective staff of servants. In the process, Belle beguiles the Beast and his servants in a way that no Eartly magic could ever do. Will she break the curse? What astonishes me about the characterization and social dynamics of the characters is the message that the writers are trying to convey. Clearly Gaston is the villain and the Beast really isn't a villain at all. Gaston is an attractive yet poor man who really has no authority of his own besides exacting his will upon the citizens of the town. Whereas the Beast is an isolated prince who really hasn't done much to hurt anyone. So that is the message of this film: looks can be deceiving. Overall, this film is a treasure of American pop culture. There will be a live action adaptation to be released later this year. And that is fine, I just think that it wouldn't be the same at all. The story is truly for children and teens and I think that it would really be a disservice to change its image to appease a completely different type of audience with a British actor cast as Belle. Such wonderful songs and captivating scenes that you'll surely fall in love with as I have.  "
49175,tt0047396,AdFin,united kingdom,10,Hitchcock challenges the audience to put themselves in the picture.," The great thing about Rear Window, as others have probably pointed out much better than I can, is the fact that Hitchcock challenges the audience to look at themselves and make the decision of just how far are we, to some extent, the voyeur. We spend our entire lives watching other people's lives unfold before us on some kind of screen or other, and with the recent explosion in reality based TV shows, the lines between entertainment and exploitation are becoming increasingly blurred. And Rear Window is one of the few films of this cycle to actual make an interesting point. Hitchcock uses the environment of the protagonist L.B. Jeffries (his cramped apartment) and never allows us to leave, so we see the entire film evolve from our hero's eyes, helping us identify more. This is also an important devise, as it means that we the audience are only given privilege to the same information that Jeffries has. Hitchcock creates an atmosphere and a tension that lasts for ever, right up to the very last minute, never giving the audience an opportunity to breath, we're in the same position that James Stuart's character is in and for a moment, because Hitchcock has so expertly put us in that position we can suspend disbelief and almost feel what he is going through. If anyone ever has any doubts as to what a talented director Hitchcock was, then immediately point them in the direction of Rear Window. One of the greatest films ever made. 10/10  "
73922,tt0052357,AdFin,United States,8,Must we all fall before we awake?," REVIEW CONTAINS MILD SPOILERS The problem with Vertigo, is that it's neither one thing nor the other, unable to decide what it wants to be. We open as a detective story, an American detective story, as there is never a trace of noir, but slightly removed from reality, more so than the usual detective story, in a way that everything about the world in which the characters inhabit has an odd sanitised look and feeling, as though there is never any real danger around the corner. The same thing could easily be applied to Hitchcock's other classic Rear Window, in which besides from the ominous threat of the man across the way, we never had any other worry for L.B. Jeffries. In Vertigo the lead character is Scottie Ferguson (James Stuart), a detective hired by an old friend to keep a trace on his wife who he believes has been acting irrationally. Scottie obliges, but pretty soon begins to develop an unhealthy obsession with the woman. Hitchcock masterfully layers his subtexts and dreamscapes into his dense visuals, but the crux of the story only becomes more misguided. We are torn somewhere between detective story and avant-garde psychological drama. The plot becomes more complex as we move along, with the kind of twist a-minute scenarios that modern audiences have come to expect, as Scottie is lead deeper into a web of mystery and deceit he has no chance of controlling. There are many varying interpretations of Vertigo, most of which only thicken the plot more. There is of course the irrational idea that Scottie dies during the opening leap across the building, or that he is fatally wounded, and the entire film unfolds like a dream, rapidly becoming a nightmare, but this variation only makes the ending of the film seem flawed. For this to work, the d«∏nouement would need to be less vague, although the idea of the nun brings a nice touch about Scottie confronting his faith, and his run up the steps of the tower becoming an almost allegorical riff on the old stairway to heaven motif, as the wounded Scottie slips from this world into death. But like I said, it only raises unnecessary complications. This idea also fails to give insight into Scottie's mental breakdown, if this is a dream, or some kind of life or death situation, then what would be the point of it. Hitchcock's imagery is as much a part of the film as the complex plot, as I mentioned before his composition and iconography layers false dreams and false realities, within the subconscious of the character. Is it Scotties point of view we are seeing or Madeleine/Judy (Kim Novak)? We are never sure of anything in the world of Vertigo, so we the audience must create our own false realities behind the film, to lull us into thinking we have a grasp on the proceedings, but we never fully will. This is were the dream logic comes into play, the idea that we never fully awake from a dream until we fall, much like Judy's character at the end of the film, have we been viewing the proceeding through her eyes? Who knows, much like a dream, Vertigo is a film that will never be understood, and despite some minor nagging flaws, it's better to just enjoy it whilst it lasts.   "
103833,tt0050976,AdFin,united kingdom,10,Unarguably one of the greatest motion pictures ever made.," My first taste of the work of Ingmar Bergman came late last year, when I first saw The Virgin Spring. My initial reaction to that film was one of bewilderment; being new to Bergman, I just wasn't sure what to make of it. The second Bergman film I saw was Persona; again I just didn't fully grasp the film and in my naivety, belittled the staggering work of art I now hail it as by saying that it needed to make sense. I know understand Bergman's work a little better, and understand that The Virgin Spring was Bergman's least personal film, and one that he accepted as a director for hire. Persona on the other hand is often credited as the director's most complex and experimental film, open to interpretation and definitely not a film for all tastes. Now I have seen my third Bergman film, the classic of art-house cinema that is The Seventh Seal. The Seventh Seal is everything a great film should aspire to be, a joy to watch from start to finish and filled with a mixture if wonderful performances and haunting images. It was also nice to see a much more simplistic story after the mind bending Persona. Here Bergman's key concerns are not psychological mind games and disintegrating personalities, instead he looks at the themes that would in later years become synonymous with his cannon of work, religion, and death (or waiting for death, as illustrated in Cries & Whispers as well as here). The film follows knight Antonious Block (Max Von Sydow) and his companion J«Ùns as they return from the crusades. Death has long since walked besides Block, and now the hooded figure believes it is his time to go, Block however has other ideas and challenges Death to a game of chess, if he wins, his life will be spared. This gives us the first iconic image of the film, possibly the first major iconic image of art-house film-making, as Block sits by the sea playing chess with the apparition of Death. As the film moves on, Block and his companion make their way to the nearest town, where a religious procession enter and warn the villagers of the plague. This is another key sequence in the film, and the way Bergman films the entrance is nothing short of genius. The cutting and camera angles (together with the naturally beautiful black and white film stock) evoke and convey the growing sense of dread that has been following our hero's from the outset. The key theme in this film seems to be not only religion, but also loss of faith. Antonious spends much of his time condemning the crusades for the pointless loss of millions, all in the name of god, and later it becomes more apparent that Block believes god to have abandoned him. This truly is a classic film, and a true work of cinematic art. 10/10    "
105576,tt0080678,AdFin,united kingdom,10,"The stream flows, the wind blows, the cloud fleets, the heart beats... Nothing will die"," Never could one hope to find a film as ugly and beautiful as David Lynch's film biography of John Merrick (The Elephant Man). Merrick's story is perhaps one of the most heartbreaking and appalling cases of human injustice to those different, with a strong message, which still holds importance to this day. In the hands of a lesser talented director this film may have been just another pointless Hollywood story, but in the hands of Lynch the film becomes a haunting, beautiful, but at the same time, highly disturbing work of art. Always surrealistic in its storytelling approach, the film sets up Merrick's complicated birth with an abstract dream/flash back sequence, dimly lit and photographed in gloriously grainy black and white the audience can't help but be immediately drawn in to the story. The film then jumps forwards, and introduces us to the character of Fredrick Treves (Hopkins) at a London carnival, where Merrick is being shown as part of the sideshow. Treves is unable to see Merrick due to the police, who close the show before he gets there, but hungry for a glimpse he arranges to for a private showing with Merrick's owner Bytes. Lynch is reluctant to show us Merrick in full daylight for the first quarter of the film, which in my opinion was a clever move, because it allows we the audience to share Treve's intrigue as to weather or not the tag Elephant Man is suited, or whether we are being duped into seeing something not too much out of the ordinary. It is only later that, after we see Merrick, we realise that he is truly deformed beyond human recognition. The next part of the film is where the real argument of The Elephant Man rests, the age-old argument of beauty only being skin deep and how those who have beauty on the outside often have none on the inside. As Merrick goes to show the staff of the hospital of which he's taken residency that he is an articulate, erudite human being, he is slowly integrated into polite society, not from respect though, the crowds are only gathering because viewing Merrick has become something of a status symbol, and this is where Treve's must decide whether or not he has forced John to exchange one freak-show for another. For me The Elephant Man is one of the most staggering and moving films of recent cinema, the herald of a maverick talent in the then young David Lynch, and brimming with evocative production design, beautiful photography and a wealth of fine performances from Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud and Michael Elphick, not to mention Hurt's remarkable performance hidden under layers of prosthetic make-up. It is true what others have said, that The Elephant Man is a very bleak, very downbeat film, a film not afraid to hold a mirror to society's injustices, but the ending is uplifting in a different way than most conventional happy endings. In the respect that John has just has the happiest day of his life, and no day will ever be that good, so the perfect way to end that perfect day, is to sleep like he has always wanted to, even if it will result in his own death. With the final line (used as my summary), we are told that nothing dies, that the spirit will always live on. What a touching sentiment to the endurance of the human spirit. A masterpiece 10/10   "
133320,tt0060827,AdFin,united kingdom,10,I understand and admire," Back in December, after my first viewing of Persona, I stated that the film was ""not as great as other reviewers had made out""∂? How wrong I was. I watched Persona again last night and found it, second time around, to be challenging, interesting and enjoyable, emotions and feelings that went straight over my head on first viewing. This is the closest thing to ""real"" cinema that I have seen, because it doesn't offer the viewer any easy answers, Bergman lets the story unfold, and as he goes deeper into the psyche of the character he expects us to pay very close attention to what he is doing. The film is pretentious, unashamedly, but the way Bergman takes the style from the narrative means that the pretension isn't a bad thing, because the images of Persona are some of the most memorable and haunting that any director has dared to show. From the opening images of the young boy framed in front of a full-screen rear projection of his mother, to the famous image of the two women's faces merged as one, the images help the audience decode some of the more complicated elements of the plot. Now I must mention the acting (something I glossed over in my first review), because there are better performances in this film than any other I can think of at this moment. Firstly Liv Ullmann, who is simply amazing as the broken-down actress Elisabeth Vogler, she manages to seem both trustworthy, but at the same time controlling without speaking a single line of dialog, and she's helped out enormously by Bibi Andersson. The way that Bergman uses these very different (but in some way similar) actresses, is to contradict their actions at every turn, to continually play with their status within the film, Ullmann comes off as the masculine character, despite the fact that her profession would call for her to be feminine. Similarly, Andersson's nurse Alma often comes off as being far too weak for her vocation, but is this a general character flaw, or just a continuation of the role reversal the two women are undergoing. There is still a great deal of Persona that I don't understand, and maybe I never will but this only makes me want to watch the film again and again, as it's the perfect film to just loose yourself in. There is so much that I have picked up on since my first viewing that I could write about this film for even longer, but this is not my personal forum form any kind of film critique. All I can say is Persona is a film that must be watched multiple times, every viewing only strengthens my affection for it and my growing admiration for Bergman that hit full swing after I saw The Seventh Seal. In December I gave this film a rating of 8/10, now I feel compelled to, not only change that score to a 10, but also to see the film again. A true masterpiece∂?   "
146829,tt0072684,AdFin,united kingdom,10,"As with all Kubrick movies we're dealing with a cold, detached story of a man searching for his own identity."," Very much a film of two halves, the first chronicling the rise of Redmond Barry, and the second dealing with the fall of the now appointed Barry Lyndon. This is a similar structure device applied by Kubrick, notably in A Clockwork Orange and later in Full Metal Jacket, both of which depicted the long development process of an individual at odds with his society and surroundings. The parallels between Barry, Alex and Private Joker are staggering, from the cynicism and underhanded intelligence, they each, somehow manipulated their way from common rogue, to a character with reasonable standing within the structural society of the film. The second Act is by far the strongest part of the film, because it is by this stage that we begin to feel empathy for Barry, but it is also the part of the film, which differs greatly from those other Kubrick masterpieces. For example, A Clockwork Orange showed our hero return to his murderous ways, cured by the state that originally imprisoned him for his crimes, whereas Full Metal Jacket showed the platoon soldier on, in both instances we got the impression that the film may be over for us but the characters had a long way to go. This isn't the case with Barry Lyndon. Although it may be argued that Barry's ""luck of the Irish"" lifestyle may still have some excitement left in it, there is the feeling that we have all ready been privy to the best part, that no matter what happens next for him will not reach the same unbelievable fortune and misfortune that has followed him through the course of the film. Kubrick plays with notions of loyalty, love, power, deceit, war, honesty and nobility with Barry Lyndon, never allowing the film to flag or become tiresome. As much a film of technicality as it is performance (as with all Kubrick), it was to be the film that would set the visual staple for subsequent period films The Dualists, Dangerous Liaisons and Amadeus. Kubrick's approach to filming in Barry Lyndon is like filming renaissance paintings, employing the long zoom in's/zoom out's to show us the necessary information, never merely cutting away to an object. This is so rare nowadays, with cuts in films getting quicker and quicker, Kubrick manages to condense everything of importance of those times (fashion, architecture, music) and fill every corner of the frame, and the recurring theme of Handel's Sarabande is hauntingly evocative. The performances are strong, given Kubrick's standing as a visual film-maker, with Ryan O' Neil giving a fine performance, along with Leonard Rossiter, Patrick Magee, Marisa Berenson, and Leon Vitali ensures that acting is of the same calibre as the cinematography, and O' Neil giving the standout of his career (even with the accent). An overwhelmingly beautiful film that should rank amongst Kubrick's greatest, which has somewhere along the lines been sadly forgotten. With a deep emotion and wonderful moments, Kubrick's film version of Barry Lyndon has that rare power to restore the love of film-making to any jaded film fan. 10/10    "
78881,tt0066921,AdFin,hong kong,10,"As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures"," It's got to be handed to Kubrick; no other director can be cited as making so many back-to-back classics in his working career. His ability to move seamlessly from genre to genre, still covering the themes of man's metamorphosis, his place in the universe and his desire to choose between right and wrong, is something some filmmakers never manage. If his previous film 2001: A Space Odyssey was his attempt to look at man's place in existence, the surely A Clockwork Orange is a look at man's place in society, not in any Ken Loach, lower class, upper class rivalry way, but in how man functions in society. The question raised by Kubrick and writer Anthony Burgess is `if man cannot freely choose between right or wrong does he cease to be a man?' Kubrick and Burgess seem to be in agreement, yes! But whereas Burgess' novel showed us that, given time, the person will soon grow-up and decide for themselves, once and for all, what path to choose in life. But because Kubrick missed the last chapter of the book, the film takes on an entirely different agenda. The year is now 2002, we have sailed through the year that Kubrick made famous with his watershed sci-fi picture, and we stand looking out at an uncertain future, and one thing that stands out, is the shocking similarities between the fantasy of A Clockwork Orange, and the reality of the everyday world. Hooligans are everywhere, teenage louts that have elderly people too terrified to leave their homes after dark, our countries are run by lying, back-stabbing politicians who are always out for their own gain, and now scientists are looking into new treatments for the correction and rehabilitation of violent offenders. It's not hard to see the pompous politicians of A Clockwork Orange and not subliminally think of Jack Straw or Tony Blair stood at the podium. And this is the talent of Stanley Kubrick, his ability to build lasting images through his own visual sense. Everything about his movies takes on a certain iconography, they not only represent the style of the times they where made and simultaneously dictate the style of when they are set, I mean, who wasn't just a bit let down by the year 2001's less than glorious look in comparison to Kubrick's vision, in the same way we are perturbed by A Clockwork Orange's dilapidated future. Kubrick turns Burgess' themes into a full scale plan of attack, complimenting his message by utilizing all the camera and editing effects that went into the grandeur of 2001, but simplifying them to conform to both the idea of A Clockwork Orange, and the film's limited budget. The use of slow-motion and ultra-speed works well, even if the laughable high-speed sex orgy looks like a throw back to the days of Benny Hill, and some people have trouble with the use of back projection and process shots, but all of these help build the world of the film, and help dictate the skewed perception of Alex (McDowell). Both the character of Alex and the way in which McDowell portrays him is unbelievably complex, guiding the audience through this world with his narration, he makes the audience one of his `droogs' which means that we like Alex right from the start, his actions may appal us, but at this stage he's our only ally. This is another one of Kubrick's trump cards, because if we like Alex, then we will feel for him as his victims take their revenge, and that's when the film has you, when you start to feel sympathy for this amoral character. `What's it going to be then?' is the future of A Clockwork Orange almost upon us, is Kubrick such a master film-maker that his films have the ability to predict time? Well, since none of us are now actually revolving in a space station to the haunting echo of `The Blue Danube' I would say no. But it is impossible to watch the images of restrained violence and political corruption of A Clockwork Orange and not be drawn in, and more importantly not you leave feeling overwhelmed by the attention to detail and iconic, haunting images that Kubrick shows us. Pop-art fantasy, or harsh political indictment, you decide. 10/10    "

Instead, each and every day, I can see more and more people losing intelligence and becoming more and more like bots. From the rating of this movie on IMDb, it's clear that we, pure Humans, are already in minority. I, in fact, don't watch television. So unlike other folks, I had no idea, anticipation or excitement for this movie. I'm thankful for that because I would have been even more disappointed. I went to a corporate screening as my friend had an extra pass. I just knew that it was a Pixar movie and that was all I needed to know. Not anymore. The movie starts and it definitely generates curiosity. I like environmental and political sarcasms as long as they are funny. All that premise about the huge junkyard and skySCRAPers was good.

I'm not saying it's bad, it's just not as I expected in an 'ultimate' superheroes movie. Ultimate as more superheroes = more awesomeness. However, most of this film is more about battle of ego than saving the world, actually their ego are the real threats to this world. Except Hulk which seems there purely for action, the others need some push and a good person must die, like saving the world is not enough cause and a retaliation/revenge gives better reason. So some reel time is waste for this 'superhero drama' instead for action. I kind of disappointed with these 'selfish' superheroes. Luckily, Hulk gives several comic relief and save the movie. The action is slowly build up towards the end (too slow for me) but it pays off in the final battle. Not as spectacular as I expected but in the end it provides just enough reason why there must be a team like Avengers in this Marvel Universe. The thing that disturbed me the most is those Americans, those people who happen to be in the wrong time at the wrong place - well, not only in this film but also others like the Transformers series, etc. The city streets has become the battle ground and those mortal, ordinary people still there in the streets, watching very closely like it's just a parade or a flash mob and deliberately provide themselves as collateral damages. What's wrong with these people? Is every Americans so stupid or have suicidal tendencies? Audience can except the collateral damages, the panicked citizens, people runs for their life in the 1st 3 minutes of the battle, but after that the filmmaker should simply have a scene of these people watching from afar, behind road blocks with police guard, peeking from a secure hide-out etc. The execution is good but the script could be improved. We already know they are superheroes and there are already prequels for each character so instead of taking lots of time talking out of their differences, let these characters solve their differences in battle over battle before the final one. Lots of battle, lots of action's awesomeness. Therefore, my grin could last for days. They also failed to explain why Hulk can transform from an uncontrollable destroyer into a cooperative teammate in no time which feels like I miss some important scenes. The use of CGI - after several 'heavy CGI' films - is starting to become dull. It's like the film maker has no other choice to awe audience than using bigger explosion, more fatal destructions. Film like ""chronicles"" provide better use of CGI for enhancing the story while not as grande as this. So overall, I give it 6.5/10. Sorry for my English.  "

94510,tt0372784,adhuston,united states,10,This movie is amazing,"this movie was incredible, amazing wonderful, absolutely perfect. Chris Nolan you rock. Thank you for restoring this franchise to the glory it so richly deserves. The casting, writing, story, camera work, everything was perfect. The only knock I have is the Katie Holmes character was kinda cheesy and was like it was just tossed in to keep the chicks interested. But she did look good in the leather skirt, boots, and silk blouse. Everything was so perfectly done I'm just in awe still. It really could not have been any better. From beginning to end it was a perfectly done perfectly visioned perfectly executed film. I just could not gush over this any more if I tried. I want everyone to see this movie. It would be awesome if it did indeed break 250 mil this weekend. Who knew it was this tough to come up with 10 lines. Well I hope you go see this movie and that this entices those to do so.  "
76339,tt0211915,Adi Heller,united states,10,On-screen poetry," While watching Amelie, I was filled (for the first time since ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) by my immense love of the cinema. This movie filled me with joy, but more importantly, with Amelie. The wonder of this movie is its ability to keep you in the moment. Every emotion of Amelie is felt by the audience. Via his poetic and artistic techniques, Jeunet transports you into the separate realities of his characters, as successfully as Darren Aronofsky did in ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a Dream,"" but Jeunet's pallete of emotions is far greater. As I exited, a couple of the people I was with were bubbling away, ""Oh, everything about that made me happy,"" ""didn't you just love Amelie so much,"" etc. Do not let people's simplification of this movie detract from it. Yes, people will fixate on some of the surface qualities of this film, but it is, regardless, a triupmh, as well as the best movie you will see this year.   "

The story in the movie is not an usual one , with a lot of crazy things in it is quite awesome .The characters are played very well by some awesome actors . So maybe you ask yourself that why should you watch this movie , well maybe because Joker is one of the best super villain and you don't want to miss seeing Joker , and Batman is awesome too ,preety awesome.So , what are you waiting for ?

157778,tt0848228,ADi Raju,india,9,The most awaited film of the summer. Delivers.,"This, by far, is the best super hero action movie, ever. Forget the actors, forget the graphics and forget the heroics of the hulk, the script is so captivating and the screen play so damn good that it is impossible to feel unimpressed when one leaves the show. I rate this 9 just because I happen to watch it with 5 of my friends, none of the group watching any of the original films of the super heroes. They were confused initially till I find sometime and give them the brief of each of them. And when the movie finished, they were grinning ear to ear, with a promise to watch all 5 movies of the super hero movies. That captivating this movie is! The movie predictably starts slow so as to introduce the superheroes and then picks up speed never to stop. The goosebumps were felt till I left the place to return the 3D glasses :D Then comes the performances. Everyone gave their best performance and the list is topped by the performances of Robert Downie Jr, Mark Ruffalo, Hiddleston and Cobie Smulders. The dialogs were crisply written, entertainingly delivered and thoroughly enjoyed! The 3D was not so worthy to die for. It my be the theater, or the glasses but it is not up to the mark of not even Mysterious Island as I found one of my friend just removing the glasses and watching the film as is. The CGI was good, Iron man just awesome and HULK, no words! I have found the trailers good but living through the scene of the group of super heroes is just a brain freezing experience for me. Go watch it and enjoy it. Definitely can be watched in 3D but 2D in a good theater works just fine. I will watch it again and might probably buy a DVD/Blu-ray for my 42"". Deal!  "

142300,tt1201607,adialex18,india,6,Disappointing,"I went to this movie with high expectations considering the good job the makers had done with the first part,but all this movie did was leave a bad taste in my mouth and was ultimately a huge disappointment. I really did not get what the makers were trying to do in the end. It was as if they had lost the plot in the last half an hour. The movie to a certain part does keep in line with the book but just when you think this will be the best potter movie ever, it gets screwed up and screwed up big time. Daniel Radcliffe sleepwalks through the entire film probably just wanting to do away with the movie. Everybody else get bit role. The ending was a big disappointment especially for the people who have read the book. Voldemort looks unintentionally funny,especially his laugh after showing the dead body of Harry to everyone. I warn you this scene is really funny.I think everyone was laughing for this scene.His voice is also really bad,not at all fear inducing. I cant believe Harry did not get any applause for defeating 'the greatest dark lord in history'. A big joke really. Sure it is the end of an era and even i clapped when the movie ended but somehow the end was not that satisfying. Great graphics and the humour when intended has come out really well.  "
149858,tt1954470,adi-animesh,india,10,GOW - a movie that Indian cinema can be proud of !,"In an era where mediocrity is sold in the name of entertainment and an average cine-goer is relentlessly served mindless blockbusters, Gangs of Wasseypur is leaps and bounds ahead of its times be it in terms of direction, screenplay, performances or dialogues. Anurag Kashyap once again stands out with this hard-hitting yet entertaining masterpiece, reaffirming his reputation and this one, in fact, catapults him into another league altogether. He can easily be termed, dare I say, Tarantino of Hindi Cinema. There have been countless movies in world cinema in general, and Bollywood in particular, based on the themes of revenge spanned across generations and gory tales of mining mafia but the panache with which film has been directed means that the viewer is never allowed a loo break. The premise of the movie is violent but it has its share of light moments that perfectly punctuate it without diluting the mood. Though every one has pitched in with enthralling performances, I was particularly impressed with Manoj Bajpayi portraying Sardar Khan, Tigmanshu Dhulia portraying Ramadhir Singh and Richa Chadda playing the wife of Sardar Khan. The dialogues are superbly penned and hailing from the heartland where the film is based, I was amazed by the details of mannerisms (or ill-mannerisms) and accent perfectly depicted in the movie. The background score is riveting and perfectly timed and so are the songs and music. Kudos to Sneha Kalwalkar for bringing out the folklore of Bihar so magnificently. If there is anything about the movie that I would change, it would be its length. The run time could have been shorter with a little bit of editing but even with this length, the film does not let your mind wander. Looking forward to the second part for an epic finale. The trailer at the end of credits sure promises it to be one.  "
108219,tt0434409,adidaserg,united states,10,Why V is so good,"V for Vendetta was an original movie that has substance. The comic book that inspired this film has many deep seeded issues that I feel we all can relate too. There was so much rich dialog that made you think, and the action had you on the edge of your seat or at least mine definitely. Hugo Weaving did a great role choice to be V he also made the character believable. I loved V for Vendetta in the theaters and can not wait to own it at home. It was a well thought out film that has an edge and was very serious about what the world can become. I knew that this movie was going to be good once I found out a little bit of background about it but I had no idea it was going to be as good as it was. More movies should take the approach of V for Vendetta because it had great screen shots, once again dialog, and a unique story line. V for Vendetta is a movie you will want to watch over and over and over again. Once you see this film it will be hard to talk about anything else but V for Vendetta.  "

But no, in the end the script writer and director just slap on your face: This is a sci-fi movie you idiot! That replicator machine ruined all the suspension the movie has built in the first 2 hours. All the tricks suddenly become so cheap. It could have been much better if Angier cooperates with that double man and drown him in the end to frame Borden up. But instead, the director got you some alien or terminator machine to replicate 100 Angiers. I registered an account on IMDb just to give this movie one star.

From Ms. Portman's terrible British accent, the unrealistic ultra violent and modernplot and the disgusting humanization of the character V, they, the writers and directors of this film, did a terrible job with the simple task of taking a graphic novel, the blueprints for how the movie should have gone ,and making it into a film. To think that the Wachowski dumbed the comic book down enough for the general public, makes me fear for the future of cinema as well as that of the human race, because the number of plot themes handed to the audience was disgraceful and childish. please please please avoid this movie at all costs.

Cinematography, acting, directing, music, effects, and, of course, the story and script. It is one of those films that you can gladly watch again. What makes the story great is that it is about a famous person, yet one that most people don't know much about, and that no movies have been made about him, until now that is. It would be great if more films were made about real-life scientists, to show the difference their inventions have made for the humanity. This film is dialogue-rich, so you better be watching it in an environment where you can concentrate and have no distractions. Spoiler alert: the exchange between Alan Turing and naval commander is especially delightful, and reminds viewers about the high- quality of British cinema.  "

And Now He Has done it again with another great movie inception such a remarkable movie you just get to know we have seen movies like the matrix and the talk about mind games movies but it is different from all others because Christopher Nolan has a different mind perception of all others who have tried a different acting is great and how the characters take you into it all you got to do is sit back keep your eyes and ears open and the rest will follow with you.  
158672,tt0169102,adil_wani,canada,10,IT SHOULD BAG THE oscars!!!," The Movie takes you back to 1940's when INDIA was a British Colony. Back then Indian Farmers had to give atleast 50% of the Cultivated product to the English Govt as a form of Revenue, which means LAGAAN in Indian Language. And one season There was Not enough Rain for people to grow enough to live, and giving lagaan was not even a possibilty but british Rulers are way too shrued to exempt them from that so they leave them with one Condition in order to get rid of the LAGAAN which was to Defeat the british Rulers in a game of Cricket and if they don't win they might have to pay double tax which was to give them everything they cultivate the whole season. So one revolutionist farmer Aamir Khan (the main lead of the film) takes up the challenge thinking that its almost impossible for them to pay them even single tax, double tax wouldn't make anything worse then it already is... so the film describes the sheer power and will of these Indian farmers which makes them Succeed!! The movie is nominated in The OSCARS under the best foriegn film and I believe it should get it with Ease... The BOTTOM LINE - A great MOVIE ...   "
45954,tt0054215,adil-iqbal77,pakistan,10,Simply the Best Mystery Movie of All Time,"There are rarely any movies that revolutionize a whole genre. Hitchcock's Psycho is undoubtedly one such movie. The movie unfolds at a pace which is perfect according to modern standards. It is a guarantee you'll be spiked on your seats for the entire length of the movie. The acting is outclass with special reference being to Anthony Perkins, the stammering motel manager and of course Vera Miles (also John Gavins acting for me). Hitchcock brings out his best direction techniques and methods in this movie. Everything about this movie just stands out, its cinematography, acting, direction, story telling.. just everything. The plot, though simple, is created with so much suspense that you'll be submerged into the movie. The climax may well be the best we have ever seen (not even comparable to climax in The Usual Suspects). For the climax alone i would rank the movie 10/10. This is one horror/mystery movie that revolutionized the way mystery movies were made. All assured, Vera Miles' screaming picture would be etched in your mind for a long time. A definite watch.  "
45552,tt0034583,adillon1208,united states,10,A movie that you can watch again and again,"This is probably one of the greatest movies of all time. Something that one could watch over and over again, probably without getting sick of it. I have seen the movie quite a few times and I must say that it is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are the perfect match and it is a great story, great acting, and great romance. If you have never seen this movie, it is a classic that you are missing out on and I highly recommend that you go watch it as soon as you can. Classics become classics for a reason, and Casablanca is amazing. The picture is very interesting because they use a special lighting on their faces for dramatic moments and film Ingrid Bergman only from her left side, because she felt that was her better side.  "
86352,tt0045152,adillon1208,united states,8,A Fantastic Mixture of Great Music and Old-Fashioned Entertainment,"I generally do not like musicals very much because they usually are sort of corny and just not my usual preference of entertainment. Singin' In the Rain, however, was something that I actually enjoyed watching very much. The movie was filled with flashy wardrobes and bright colors. The stars wore tons of make-up and enthusiastically performed talented dance moves and sang catchy tunes. There was a lot of comedy, but there was also an entertaining plot and content along with a good love story. I will admit that I also caught myself laughing out loud quite a bit, and it was very enjoyable to watch. I did not find myself getting bored or looking away once. I know that I had seen this a long time ago when I was younger, but I did not remember it very well. It was very refreshing to watch again for the first time in years, and I will honestly probably end up watching it again. The storyline with the movie star actress (Jean Hagen) being a royal witch with a B and having an annoying voice was a little corny, but still undeniably fun to watch. The ending, with Debbie Reynold's character winning the man (Gene Kelly) and becoming the huge star, was predictable, but that is part of what makes the movie a classic romantic comedy. If you are ever feeling down or depressed, perhaps because it is raining outside, put on Singin' In The Rain, and I can assure you almost completely that it will cheer you up.  "
105503,tt0017925,adillon1208,united states,10,Entertaining and well thought out,"I can honestly say that I loved this film and intend to see more with Buster Keaton. It was well thought out and fun to watch. The intro informs us that he has two loves, his train and a woman. The setting is in the Civil War and it was funny to watch him trying to enlist. They felt as though he would be more useful as an engineer than a soldier participating in the war. There is a confusion with his girlfriend and she tells him to not speak to her again until he is enlisted in the war. There is a lot of actions and stunts that Buster Keaton seems to have performed himself as the North is trying to steal his train. It was fun to watch and every minute was interesting. Something I definitely recommend and something that I would most certainly watch again.  "
143503,tt0032138,adillon1208,united states,10,Great Classic that will always be remembered,"The Wizard of Oz is an amazing classic movie that I have watched several times in my life... all the way back to when I was very little. I even used to be afraid, especially of the flying monkeys! This is a film that I will probably watch several MORE times in my life, and I think that it is rare to find a person that has not seen it. And it is also pretty rare to find someone that did not like if not love it. Even if someone has not seen it they most certainly must have heard of it. The film takes you to a great fantasy land that turns to color and Judy Garland is fantastic in it. Although there are some points of joy, Dororthy, Toto, and her new friend have to overcome many obstacles to reach the Wizard of Oz. I even feel as though the picture and sound is pretty great for a 1939 film. In my mind this film is right up there with the classic, Gone With the Wind. Although both have very different story-lines and are totally different genres of films, they were both made the same year (to my knowledge), and will forever be remembered as wonderful movies to watch again and again and again. If you feel like escaping into the world of Dorothy, Toto, The scarecrow, the tinman, the cowardly lion, and of course the Wicked Witch of the West, then I highly recommend that you watch this classic movie. It is a treat that never gets old.  "

34845,tt0114369,adimdb448,united kingdom,10,Best movie ever made," Of my top 10 movies, Se7en counts for 1 through 5. Fantastic dialogue, superb acting (OK Gwyneth but I've seen her do worse). The whole thing is totally believable (with the one exception of the 'keep out' tape on the inside) and let's face it most real life endings are not happy. I have seen this movie over 50 times and I cannot think of many movies I have seen more than twice (Pulp fiction, Fight Club, Mulholland Drive, The Producers, Matrix, Bladerunner). I have sympathy for John Doe's point of view as I am sure does Somerset. Kevin Spacey is amazing, this breaks in his voice during the car monologue shows real psychotic emotion and the framing of the scene by Fincher is simplistic genius. Pitt's acting at the end is truly gut wrenching and the subliminal flash is a clever touch used by Fincher again in Fight Club. Watch this movie again and study it for the classic it is.  "

If DiCaprio and Scorsese are not getting the Oscars for The Wolf than this whole Oscar thing is a huge piece of pure cr*p. I don't know if the whole movie is entirely a true story, maybe they exaggerated for a fact, but that doesn't make it any less good. I have never been to a movie at the cinema where the whole audience was laughing that hard. Bottom line, The Wolf of Wall Street is one of the best movies i have ever seen, the best performance for Leonardo DiCaprio, best collaboration between Leo and Martin Scorsese, the most hilarious movie i have ever seen and it's worth every minute of its 3 hours.

23268,tt0109830,adinutzza2001,romania,10,why such a low rating???,"What I find completely ridiculous is why this movie, in my opinion one of the best ever, has such a low rating, so I've tried to figure out what some found against it.I noticed that the haters of this movie who make it have a lower rating than it actually deserves mainly argue that it promotes the government's politics of submission: the idea that ""if you're an idiot but you do what you're told then you will be rewarded, but, if you experience life then you're going to die a miserable death."" I'm not an American myself so i don't have any intention to defend the government or anyone else, but I think that the political events witnessed by the character in the movie make many miss the whole substance of the film. I think these bits of history only add to the magic of the film, making Forrest part of a fantastic world that seems so incredibly real though. How can somebody say that Forrest is just an idiot, an ordinary person who does everything that he is told to do? It appears to me that in fact,in his innocence, Forrest does what he feels he has to do,no matter the situations and the people around him, lead only by an inner sense of right. So what actually seems to be special about Forrest is that, regardless of his intelligence, he has the capacity to discover simple truth and life values that all the others around him miss: he tries to save Bubba endangering his own life, he gives Bubba's family money and mainly displays simple goodness in everything he does. So if you haven't yet seen the movie or you were disappointed by it, try watching it without analyzing things that much and just open your heart towards that world. The brilliant humour, the hilarious yet touching acting, the special effects and the uplifting message are totally rewarding.  "

This character is absolutely without any conscience and its plainly stupid that Batman would keep some false promise about her, that ""something more is in you than that"". I associated it with her ""comeback"" at the end. However, this is absolutely outrageous how director forced the whole plot ending around this character. The logic was that she would leave the city as she said. Her return was just forced bullshit and just because of it Batman ""survived"". The whole scene where Batman was poked with the knife where he ""should have died"" was totally mindless. He looks like he was dying while she was speaking to him and suddenly when catwoman came to him he just stood up without any sign of injury...CMOOOOON The whole scene where 3K policemen should have engaged into assault against Banes forces was utterly stupid. Both sides possesses weapons so they should have covered and shoot !!! Instead, director chose the most stupid choice where both sides WERE RUNNING AGAINST EACH OTHER and engaged in HAND-TO-HAND COMBAT !! CMOOOOOOOOON !!! Is this movie made for people with IQ level below 70 ??? Additionaly, it was brainwashing from psychological point of view as well. In the scene where Bruce was in the jail, the only hurdle which he needed to overcome WAS REALIZATION THAT HE MUST HAVE FEAR FROM DEATH IN ORDER TO SUCECSSFULLY JUMP !

117601,tt2488496,adirregev,israel,3,Very Disappointing Episode,"One of the success factors of Star Wars was the simple story, somewhat naive, and each episode in this amazing story is dealing with another subject / issue / idea In this new movie, the writers tried to get everything from all the old episodes in one movie. Disney also tried to add some success characters and scenes from other successful movies that has nothing to do with Star Wars. So basically, if you are going to watch the movie just to see all the hero's from the past episodes and great scene that look exactly like in the older episodes (only this time in HD) - have fun. ===> BUT, if you are looking for a good story: forget it. it's not there. get ready to be disappointed.

They are so different yet so connected. It will show you that you don't need to judge by look or by color and anyone can have a chance to influence the life of the other.

Although the soundtrack is nice (if you like jazz) Both the characters and the story are unreliable. For once, a real music teacher with such character would have had his ass kicked out of school pretty quickly. So, it's kinda like ""Fame"" - only the jazz version that takes itself way too seriously! Also, J.K. Simmons character is not too far from his previous 'Schillinger' role. Only this time - he got out of (Oz) jail and decided to turn his anger and neo nazi tendencies into music. Bottom line (only because IMDb requires at least ten lines) - much much overrated.  "

The movie is a real tour d«∏ force; without a shadow of doubt Scorsese's best after 'The Last Temptation of Christ'.Perfect in every which way ,be it the ensemble cast of Hollywood's best (Nicholson,Damon) or the sheer pace of the movie (believe me this movie is actually edge of the seat stuff ,no exaggerations whatsoever) or the plot (though its a remake of the Hong Kong cult flick 'Internal Affairs' ) or the timing (including the intermission!) or the deliciously sexy Vera Farmiga (including her steamy interlude with Leo) ,the movie is prodigiously handled by 'Marty' Scorsese (arguably one of the best Directors after Kubrick).And the biggest surprise was Leo... yep this actor has come of age with this role.You can see shades of potential fulfilled after he wowed audiences with his '93 performance in 'What's eating Gilbert Grape' as an autistic savant kid.It's probably the effect of Scorsese having continued faith in this actor after he cast him in 'Gangs of New York' and 'Aviator'. And the soundtrack is gripping to say the least complementing the action on screen brilliantly (most Pink Floyd aficionados shall agree) .Surely ,Martin Scorsese is the best Director to not have won the Oscar..let's see if that changes next year! Enough said! Watch this flick ... your satisfaction is guaranteed!  "
2029,tt0111161,AdiTheGame719,united states,10,The Shawshank Redemption," The first time I've seen this movie was on December 31st, 2001. My parents and I were getting ready to down to the city and celebrate the New Year.  My father said it was a great film and it was just on TNT or TBS. I decided to watch it, and wow. This has to be the greatest film of all-time.  The acting was excellent, the directing, the writing. Everything. Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins gave excellent jobs. On my all-time favorites list, this ranks #3...  1. ""Rat Race"" (2001) 2. ""Catch Me If You Can"" (2002) 3. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" (1994) 4. ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) 5. ""Spider-Man"" (2002)  The only bad aspect of the film was that the ending was too weak.  SPOILER ALERT  When Freeman's character met Robbin's character on the beach, it was just dull. I don't even think they ever said a word. They just faded out. Couldn't they have shown what happens next? Oh, well.  SPOILER ALERT OVER.  Everything else was great and there were even some funny moments, like when the Prison owner guy found out how Robbins' character left the prison.  Since 12/31/01, I've seen the movie four more times, bought the screenplay and bought the DVD.  10/10 "

I love this film, it ranks #2 on my all-time favorites list. I highly recommend it. I just bought the autobiography and Frank Abagnale and will read it soon.

There were scenes where emotions were awakened and depicted with majesty as friends reassured their faith in each other and their want for peace. As armies march and hobbits scurry this action packed film keeps you entangled in its deep story filled with mystery, horror, excitement, war, strategy and dreams. I felt it was a great movie in which several secrets are unraveled and nations and people brought together. a must watch exciting and enticing experience!s  "
42137,tt0120586,Adithya Siva,india,9,Edward Norton Steals The Show,"This is by far, one of the greatest films I've ever seen which tackles the issues on racism, social inequalities and stereotypes. The movie is basically about a neo-Nazi skinhead who is an extreme racist, and part of a supremacist group mainly because of influences from his father, and Cameron Alexander, who is a hate-writer and a racist on the same grounds as his father. We don't get to see it much, but Cameron mainly serves as a father figure for Derek, which is why he does half the things he does throughout the course of the plot. How Derek finally realizes his mistakes, and reforms as a good and normal human being forms the crux of the plot. The movie swings between black and white visuals, and color, the former which signifies the skinhead days and flashback of the Vinyard family which is told in both Derek and his brother's perspective, and the latter being the new and reformed Derek's story. Edward Norton is the main show-stealer in this movie. After Primal Fear, and Fight Club, this is a 30 pound heavier Norton who plays a badass, and a normal human being throughout the course of the film. Tony Kaye's cinematography is brilliant, as is Anne Dudley's superb compositions which reverberate throughout the film's runtime. I was surprised that only Edward got an Oscar nomination, which he did not win (another surprise). I also felt that Tony Kaye, the film and Anne Dudley's score should also have been recognized. Other than a few niggles here and there, such as the actress who plays Norton's girlfriend in the movie's not so great performance, this movie is a treat to watch from the first minute. A must-watch.  "
250,tt0111161,aditrath,india,10,Best movie ever,"The Shawshank Redemption is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances.  The screenplay was written by Frank Darabont, who based it on the novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" by Stephen King. He adapts the material so well that he really transcends it, turning the film into a work of art. Many avid readers will claim the book is always better than the movie, but that is simply not the case here. King is a tremendous writer, but even he can't shade and color the prison the way that Darabont does, which sets the mood for the entire film. The characters King created in the book are deeper and more well drawn in the film in large part because of Darabont's script.   Many moviegoers turn their noses up at the thought of a movie about the triumph of the human spirit. However, even those jaded film fans will love ""The Shawshank Redemption"" because it sets a new standard for films in this genre. It is an unapologetically emotional and sometimes sentimental take on friendship and life, even when that life is spent in a cage, and will make viewers laugh, cry, and reflect on their own lives in ways that very few movies can. It may not have won a single Oscar, but it will win your heart, and perhaps that is more important. "
127112,tt1979320,aditsecret,india,8,"Rush, The Movie: Personal Review of an Exhilarating experience","I had zeroed in on Rush as one of the movies that I was going to watch on the big screen (the Ron Howard & F1 union factor), here in Dubai and was waiting for it eagerly. And boy it was the worth the wait. Rush is not your run-of-the-mill movie in the sporting drama bandwagon which caters only to F1 enthusiasts. F1 fan or not, the way Howard has showcased the legendary rivalry between F1 greats, Niki Lauda and James Hunt makes for compelling and intense viewing. The banter and the doses of humour interspersed throughout the flick form the crux of the ""foe-mance"" between Hunt and Lauda (played exquisitely by Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Bruhl respectively) & are the high points of film. Howard is spot on with his depiction of the events surrounding this fabled rivalry. His portrayal of the 2 legends, with contrasting personalities who are poles apart and yet are driven by equal love for the sport and ambition makes the flick, an interesting and exhilarating ride. The movie is crisply edited and moves along at just the right pace for a biopic. Apart from all this, in my opinion, ultimately what clinches it for Rush and catapults it into the ""bench mark"" shelf of movies; making it one of the great sporting drama movies of all time, are the parts just before the climax and the climax itself. The miraculous & awe-inspiring recovery of Lauda(after the life threatening crash in Nuremberg) culminating into the final race of the dramatic 1976 season in rain soaked Japan(with the stunning Mount Fuji in the backdrop) has been shot and executed ""jaw-droppingly"" well. It's a spectacle to say the least. Expect cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle to win a few accolades for his staggering work, as Howard's team on the whole excels in executing & pulling off breath-taking F1 set-pieces to perfection. In Rush, we have a film which Ron Howard & his team have managed to steer just about correctly at every corner/chicane of movie making. The flick has almost everything, right from the movie score to the acting, working for it, like a well drilled F1 car. In the end what it all boils down to; the essence of Rush, the movie, lies in its two protagonists. It's thrilling, funny and unpredictable just like Hunt and meticulously filmed, is blunt but with touch of emotional and inspirational edge to it just like Lauda. Formula 1 buff or not Rush to the nearest movie theatre to catch this un-missable adrenaline edge of the seat ride.  "
85153,tt0062622,Aditya,india,2,Recommend Watching At 4x.....8x..Or Even Faster,"This is my first comment on any movie ever , i never portrayed my self as a writer, but i had to take out the frustration of watching such an over hyped piece of ""Art""(yup I've heard they call such movies art)and to make every possible effort to stop people like me(sci-fi lovers)from watching this crap. so i decided to share my experience with you if u are thinking of watching this movie I'll suggest you watch in 2x or a faster mode. the movie is so boring,its like watching a 30 min documentary about the working of spacecrafts in super slow motion. over 95% of the total run time of movie is without any dialogues . the scenes of space ships crossing other planets were extended to the limits. i didn't understand what the first 30 minutes of the movie were about. the background score is loud,irritating , unnecessary some times, but repetitive throughout. and for some music lovers they added 3 minutes of those irritating sounds without any images in the beginning of the movie as well as after the intermission,DVD i rented had an intermission too(the most interesting part). A tiny thing this movie lacks is the ""PLOT"" after 1 hr and 10 min of the movie when hall tells Dave about the malfunction i prayed that the ship would crash and the movie will end but it didn't (my bad luck perhaps there was more of it for me to watch) the only interesting sequence was when Dave tries to get back into the spaceship and hall dies,in fact this was the only part of the movie i understood. i hoped the movie would now pace up, but that was not what the film makers had in mind. if the movie wasn't boring enough,the worst was still to come that's ""beyond the infinite"" i couldn't sum up a thing that happens after Dave enters the monolith a series of diff colored scenes then suddenly he's in a room watching himself getting old and then he's turned into some sort of cosmic baby(what was the ending all about?) the only reason i watched this is because I'm trying to watch the top 250. and this is the only one i regret watching. the one thing that's nice about this movie are the clean camera tricks used to create the anti gravity environment even in the 60's, nothing else that's why I'll give it a generous 2/10.

The movie is a fantastic depiction of drug addiction and the depths to which one might sink when afflicted by an addiction such as this. Some scenes in the movie might be pretty disturbing, but it is certainly worth sitting through. The end might not be as interesting as one might expect, but the whole movie is an experience one shouldn't miss out on. Perhaps one of Ewan McGregor's best performances. The other actors put in stellar performances that make this a definite must see. Renton's monologue on Scottish patriotism is something one should certainly hear.   "

Sounds like a recipe for a bad comedy. I thought it was going to be longest 2 hours of my life when i saw the cover of the dvd but i had nothing better to do. SO whats so exciting about a guy that takes polaroids of his car and hotel while tattooing license plate numbers on his body? Its his condition. He cant make new memories. He remebers everything uptill the accident but after that its all in pictures and tattoos. The movie cant be explained. You have to see it to comprehend it. You have to see it again to comprehend it. But you must accept one thing, the movie does not have a definite ending. the director never made it to prove anything, just to toy with our minds. We believe whatever we want to believe. We forget whatever we want to forget. We remember whatever we want to remember. But no matter how hard he tries, he cant. So, in order to make life justifiable, he decides to go on his own terms. Using his condition to his advantage, (and to others advantage or so it seems), he tries bring meaning and purpose to his life. Something he wasnt able to do before the accident. The movie is great not because it is in reverse, not because it has some fantastic direction, not because it has a sexy green jag, but because it makes one wonder if we are truly honest to ourselves. watch this one CLOSELY.

A movie that inspired the likes of the 'SAW' series, and even the music video of 'California Love' by Dr. Dre and Tupac, has to be taken seriously; and George Miller gets it right yet again. The plot revolves around Charlize Theron's character, Imperator Furiosa, with Tom Hardy as Max playing second fiddle, but adding to the madness nevertheless.

66062,tt1345836,Aditya Chakraborty,india,10,The most epic conclusion to the most epic superhero movie trilogy ever,"Thats right...you cannot rate this movie any less than 10 out of 10. Christopher Nolan has again outdone himself and have made the most thrilling and suspenseful Batman movie of this trilogy. And with Hans Zimmer's background score, it just made it more epic !! Its starts when its 8 years from Harvey Dent's death and Batman has retired. But there was a ""storm coming"" i.e. Bane. He may not be as epic as Joker (Heath Ledger), but he is definitely much more powerful and breaks Batman's back for which he is famous for in the comic books. This time Batman really got the toughest competition of all because even if he came back, he was broken, he had to RISE !!! To help him, comes the CATWOMAN/Seline Kyle. She might be a thief and even stole from Bruce Wayne, but she has a heart, Batman and her make a super cool team. The fight scenes are worth watching and she looks even better than Batman on his Bat-bike. There are many many moments in the movie which are worth applauding, specially the ones where Batman comes back. The background music is so inspiring and thrilling that it will give you goosebumps every time. Other characters like John Blake, Fox, Alfred, Commissioner Gordon were brilliant. Watch out for the character ""Miranda Tete"" !! This is just worth watching and after watching, if you give any less than 10 to this, then - ""Your punishment must be more severe"" :D :D The music is still ringing in my ears !  "
4234,tt0068646,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,The story of the Corleones: Chapter One,"Before I saw 'The Godfather', I had always wondered about it; been seeing it at #1 on the IMDb Top 250 List. It has a consistent rating of 9.1/10.0 and I was always fascinated by that. I had some really heavy duty expectations from this movie.  A friend lent me his DVD and I finally saw this movie which has widely been said to be the greatest movie in all of film history! This was quite long ago, and in all honesty I wasn't very impressed in my first viewing (probably due to my ultra-high expectations).   Now, I had heard about The Godfather Part II being better. Therefore, after knowing all the characters and the actual story in Part I, I rented Part II.  This time, I was awestruck, as I totally fell in love with Part II! I shall leave the review of 'The Godfather Part II' to its own comments section.  Since I loved Part II, I decided to watch the first installment again. Only this time, I liked it much better than the first viewing! It turned out to be one of those movies that get better with each viewing. I was also picking out the reasons why I hadn't liked it by itself at that time.   First, though, the pluses, which are aplenty! Wonderful acting from everyone in the lead roles as well as the supporting cast. Marlon Brando never fails to amaze me with his majestic screen presence! Other bravura performances: Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Richard Castellano and Al Lettieri (as Virgil Solozzo). John Cazale is good too (although he has a bigger part in Part II, so he made a bigger impression there).  The story: The novel is already one of the most popular books I've ever come across! The story is indeed powerful and quite gripping.  The cinematography: Need I mention the already talked about sepia colors Coppola has used throughout the trilogy? They add a wonderful touch to the movie and it makes the movie look more ""beautiful""!   The Lighting: Excellent effects; one noteworthy scene is the talk between Solozzo and Hagen. The dim lighting gives a brilliant touch to their topic of discussion!   The score: Beautiful, haunting music that won't let go; I still casually whistle the tunes every now and then! Thus, as far as the technical aspects are concerned, the film is flawless! (well, almost...there are a few revealing mistakes as are listed in the goofs section of this movie!)   Now the minuses: I was not happy with a couple of things. First of all, my biggest complaint..the length of Marlon Brando's screen time!! His scenes total to a length of not more than 50 mins in a running time of 175 mins!! Why? I just wished I could see more of his greater than great performance! Second thing: The blooming of Michael and Apollonia's romance in Sicily appears at a time when the story should've really moved ahead at the pace that it had caught! Those scenes in Sicily (him being ""hit by thunderbolt"" on seeing her; the exchange of glances, etc.) were just taking too long and could have easily been cut short! They just hampered the smooth flow of the story. I can say that 'The Godfather' is an almost perfect film! Minuses apart, the film has some really memorable scenes, which will go down in history as some of the classiest moments in cinema.  The Godfather saga continues in Part II, which is even better than this first offer that no respectable movie buff can refuse..... "
5499,tt0071562,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,Perfect! A Landmark in film-making; Coppola's true masterpiece.,"I fell in love with ""The Godfather Part II"" the first time I saw it! And why not? No other movie that runs for a whopping 200 minutes, has held my interest like this one has! There is not a single wasted moment in this long running time. And what's more..it has my most favourite actors Al Pacino and Robert De Niro starring in it! Words are not enough to describe this great film, and as has rightly been said by many: to call it a sequel is an insult! This is yet another movie that gets better each time you see it.  The Godfather Part II tells parallel stories of young Vito Corleone's early life and his son Michael's reign as Don Corleone. The contrast in the two eras has been shown beautifully. The colours used, the sets, the overall feel...everything has been shown to such fine detail, that it becomes impossible to even try and find a flaw in this film! The most important thing to mention here is that the flashback scenes of Vito's life appear at very apt moments! They are not placed haphazardly. Careful attention has been given to their placement, so that they fit beautifully in the present narrative of Michael Corleone.  Robert De Niro delivers a mind-blowing performance as the young Vito. He has uncannily managed to look and behave exactly like the young Vito Corleone would (given Brando's depiction of the same character in the first movie). In some scenes it actually feels as if we are watching a young Brando portraying Vito Corleone! Al Pacino is stunning as the cold, ruthless, brooding Michael Corleone! He manages to express so much through his eyes, its almost eerie! John Cazale as Fredo has a lot to do in this movie and he pulls it off wonderfully. Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen does complete justice to his role yet again! Other performances worth a very special mention include: Lee Strasberg as Hyman Roth, Michael V. Gazzo as Frank Pentangeli, Gaston Moschin as Don Fanucci and G.D. Spradlin as Senator Geary.  Diane Keaton is better in this movie than in the first as Kay; Talia Shire as Connie is adequate.  Also, special mention about the choice of actors playing the young Tessio and young Clemenza (John Aprea and Bruno Kirby respectively); they actually bear an uncanny resemblance to the older actors playing these same parts in Part I.  The cinematography, needless to say, is amazing! The sepia tone makes the film appear like a beautiful painting.... The score: once again, a class apart!   This is one ""sequel"" that truly surpasses the original! I try not to call it a sequel as far as possible, because the word ""sequel"" simply doesn't fit! ""The Godfather Part II"" is an offer that no one should/can ever refuse!! To do so would quite simply be a ""crime""..... "
10347,tt0050083,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,Brilliance Unlimited!,"Now here's that kind of a film, writing about which is a major task! Words are not enough to describe this gem, which after 51 years of its release, has stood the test of time..and still packs the punch. All the newfangled courtroom dramas of later times cannot hold a candle to this ""classic"" in the true sense of the word. I was shocked to read it performed poorly at the box office on initial release, in spite of the huge critical acclaim. The movie, which is the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet, is the film adaptation of Reginald Rose's play. The screenplay for the film was penned by Rose himself. The story is fairly simple, with 12 jurors assigned the task of presenting a verdict on the case of a boy accused of killing his father. What seems to be an open and shut case, takes an ambiguous turn when one of the jurors votes ""not guilty"" against eleven others voting ""guilty"". This leads to some immensely gripping and taut drama full of very interesting debate that never lets up until the words ""The end"" appear on the screen! Wonderfully directed by Sidney Lumet, this is quite possibly the best film of his career. There are lots of unique features of this film. The cast is all-male. None of the character names are revealed (almost). They only have a ""juror number"" to identify each other by. The entire film (with the exception of a couple of small scenes) is shot in one small Jury Room. The performances are all superb. The most notable ones are those delivered by Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Joseph Sweeney, George Voskovec, Ed Begley, Jack Warden and Jack Klugman. ""12 Angry Men"" is a movie that is sure to appeal to every generation. It is one of those ""immortal"" movies that never age with time! And it is surely an example for all filmmakers and movie-buffs. No special effects, no stunts, no gimmicks...just pure drama, thrilling and powerful! Go and buy the DVD now..and preserve it..for your kids..your grandkids..your great-grandkids...... "

29375,tt0099685,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,The complete and true gangster classic...,"This is one of those movies that you can give as a good example anytime you want to mention movie-making brilliance to anyone. ""Goodfellas"" is a true gangster classic; a complete picture of the mafia and its operations. Comparisons to ""The Godfather"" movies are inevitable, but I shall say only this: both are great classics in their respective places and deal with separate stories; ""The Godfather"" movies are a riveting look at the goings-on in the life of the Corleone Crime family, while ""Goodfellas"" is a portrayal of the life of the mobsters who actually do all the jobs that some head of a crime family might want done! Also, ""Goodfellas"" has more of a ""jolly"" mood throughout the movie; you find yourself experiencing a feeling of triumph every time they pull off a job! ""The Godfather"" movies on the other hand have more of a somber atmosphere, enhanced by their sepia overtones, and topped off with a very serious and grave approach to story-telling. ""Goodfellas"" is based on the true story of a young man named Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) who grows up to be a gangster in the company of other gangsters he has always admired! These include Jimmy (Robert De Niro), Tommy (Joe Pesci) and Paulie (Paul Sorvino). The movie takes an inside look at the operations carried out by the New York Mob. It also shows how Henry along with his partners Jimmy and Tommy, carries out a number of heists. All throughout the movie, these gangsters seem to be having complete fun, with things going their way all the time! It's only towards the end that things start to fall apart.... There are some terrific scenes which have already gone down as classics and only get better with repeated viewings; there's some very witty and fantastic dialog (most of which is hogged by the brilliant Joe Pesci). Acting: Ray Liotta is great in the lead; but the best performances are by Robert De Niro (even though he has less screen presence), Joe Pesci (awesome, the way he mouths off the sharp dialog) and Paul Sorvino. Lorraine Bracco is superb as Henry's wife, Karen. Wonderfully directed, brilliantly acted, this thoroughly entertaining movie is a must-see!

And after that there is no turning back, as this intriguing, taut thriller unfolds and weaves a suspenseful web, forcing you to pay attention, lest you miss something! ""Memento"" is one of those movies that require repeated viewings. Not just to understand the smaller points/facts that you may not have caught in the first viewing; but simply to experience this mind-blowing puzzle of a movie over and over again! It is highly addictive and it did leave me with a number of questions in my head (apart from the ending). The only way to answer these questions was to watch it again! And it seemed just as enjoyable as it did in the first viewing! This is one of the best examples of modern noir, and quite possibly the best film released that year! It must have taken an awful lot of thinking to structure the film in the manner shown. This is a very different form of story-telling and it works to the best effect! Guy Pearce is great as the confused man who lives only on the basis of some pictures, scribblings and tattoos, 'cause he is suffering from short-term memory loss. Now is that bad or is that bad! Imagine yourself in one situation or place, not remembering how you got to that place in the first place! Not recalling who you spoke to..maybe ten minutes back! Step into Guy's shoes while you watch the movie and you will realize the horror of his situation! Of the supporting cast, Joe Pantoliano delivers a fantastic performance as Teddy. Carrie-Anne Moss looks beautiful and does justice to her role. Likewise, Stephen Tobolowsky and Larry Holden in their respective small roles. Films like ""Memento"" make me want to expand my movie horizons. ""Memento"" is one of the reasons why I just love watching the movies....  "
59581,tt0078748,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,Terror like never before,"A movie like ""Alien"" comes once in a blue moon. It takes immense talent to make a creature flick and pull it off beautifully. Rarely are there any creature movies which don't have cheap, laughable effects or n-number of plot holes! ""Alien"" succeeds where countless other ""inspirations"" fail! ""Alien"" tells the story of a crew of 7 returning to earth in a mining ship Nostromo. They intercept a signal, possibly an S.O.S. from a distant planet and go on to investigate. What follows is a deadly journey of terror like never before. ""Alien"" has got some of the finest creature effects for the time 1979! The face-hugger and the scenes involving the face-hugger carry such shock value; it is surprising that the film-makers from later years who resort to cheap thrills in movies, haven't even been able to get close to showing anything to this effect! It is amazing how they have managed to make these effects look so good. The director is intelligent. He makes sure that the creature is never shown in its entirety. This trick works like magic, and it looks so real; thus, not for one moment does it seem as if there is a dummy running around in an Alien costume! Another selling point of ""Alien"" is the nail-biting suspense! The creature appears on screen for a minimal time, but the director makes sure the presence of the creature lurking around in the corners is felt! The set of the space-ship is so real, its scary! Kudos to the Production designers and set decorators. Likewise, the lighting within the ship; it gives an authentic touch to the set and adds to the thrill-effects. The sound effects are wonderful and very convincing! In summary, almost everything on the technical front deserves an A grade. Now, the actors: All the characters are fully developed, and each one carries equal importance. That is very important in a movie that shows the involvement of a lot of characters. These characters are brilliantly portrayed by all of the actors involved: Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton; special mention of Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto and Veronica Cartwright. It is difficult to pick out any single performance as unconvincing. Everyone has done a fantastic job. This is Ridley Scott's masterpiece. ""Alien"" will remain a landmark film in the Sci-fi-Horror-creature movies, and will always remain way on top of all other cheap imitations from the same genre.  "
60667,tt0043014,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,Stunning film....A Hollywood Tragedy!,"Sunset Blvd. is a film that you cannot possibly miss! It has got to be one of the darkest movies I have ever seen. And to think it came out in the 50s..... It is the story of a lonesome actress of the Silent movie era, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson), who cannot come to terms with the fact that her days of glory are long gone.... In such a scenario, a series of events lead to her meeting a young screen-writer by the name of Joe Gillis (William Holden). What follows is a tragic tale of madness....a tale which will show that Hollywood is not always the rosy picture it is made out to be! The film is brilliantly directed by Billy Wilder. Hats off to Gloria Swanson for her extraordinary performance as Norma Desmond. She totally rules the screen throughout the movie! William Holden is great as Joe Gillis. Also, equally good is Erich Von Stroheim in a supporting role. Most people may just ignore this film on face value, since it is Black and White and was released in 1950. But I would like to state here, that just this once, at least for this film, make an exception. Rent this movie or just buy the DVD. It's very well worth it. 10/10.  "
61808,tt0050825,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,A strong anti-war statement,"Stanley Kubrick's 1957 war film, ""Paths of Glory"" based on a novel of the same name by Humphrey Cobb is more of an anti-war statement. Hence, calling it a 'war film' wouldn't be right, as it does not lie in the same category as other war films, plot-wise. The film is set during World War I. The story focuses on the war between the French and the Germans. General Mireau (George Macready) sends his division headed by Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas) on a suicidal mission to take over a prominent German position called ""Anthill"". Initially Mireau is reluctant to carry out this task, but is enticed by an offer of promotion from his superiors. With this in mind, he practically forces Dax to begin with the mission. Col. Dax, also aware of the danger associated with the mission, points the same out to Mireau but Mireau does not relent. Sure enough, the mission ends in disaster and what follows next is the crux of this powerful story. What happens when these men in the very same army, defending the same country, from the same regiment turn against each other? What happens when some superior officers get greedy and selfish and stop valuing human life, more so, the lives of their own soldiers? ""Paths of Glory"" goes deep in the psyche of these men, both superiors and subordinates and makes a strong statement on what war does to them. ""Paths of Glory"" was just a modest success commercially, I've read. It comes as a surprise, considering the screenplay by Stanley Kubrick, Calder Willingham and Jim Thompson is spell-binding, to say the least. Kubrick directs with his touch of genius and creates a tremendous impact. The first scene of attack on Anthill is so masterfully shot, you actually feel you are in the field of battle! Ditto for the rest of the film when things take an unexpected turn for some of the less fortunate soldiers. Every frame of this picture is gripping, right 'til the final one. Kirk Douglas delivers a fabulous performance as Colonel Dax. His helplessness and the growing frustration about the greedy and corrupt army officers and the overall futility of the system is so convincing, it creates a lasting impression. This is one earnest and unforgettable performance by the legendary actor. George Macready lends a great supporting act as the selfish, cut-throat General Mireau. So do others, including Wayne Morris, Ralph Meeker, Joe Turkel and Timothy Carey. A special mention here, of Mrs. Kubrick (Christiane Kubrick) who makes an appearance for a short scene to sing the haunting German folk song, 'The Faithful Hussar'. She appears in a scene towards the end in what could be one of the best and most haunting endings I've ever seen in film. ""Paths of Glory"" may not be as popular as some of Stanley Kubrick's later films, but it is definitely one of his best.  "
71370,tt0364569,Aditya Gokhale,india,9,Intense Korean thriller...,"I have been wanting to see ""Oldboy"" after reading some rave reviews. Just the thought of watching a movie in Korean language, subtitled in English was making me postpone it! Anyway, I caught it on the Sundance channel the other night, and I watched with amazement, as what unfolded on screen was one of the most powerful stories of vengeance I have ever come across. This is not your ordinary, run of the mill Asian action movie. Although it may seem like it is...in the first half; but as the mystery begins to unravel, you realize that this is something different altogether! The complete package comes as a brutal, disturbing and shocking tale of revenge that is bound to haunt you for a long time after the movie ends. Min-sik Choi delivers a terrific performance as Dae-Su Oh. This movie is certainly not for the squeamish..it contains some scenes that are difficult to sit through. An important note for viewers from India (especially lovers of Bollywood movies): Please see ""Oldboy"" before you see the upcoming Sanjay Gupta movie ""Zinda"", starring Sanjay Dutt. It is a blatant copy of ""Oldboy"", as is obvious from the plot line and the trailer. After you see ""Oldboy"" you may not want to see ""Zinda"" after all, since you wouldn't want to spoil the powerful effect of the former.  "
74507,tt0022100,Aditya Gokhale,india,9,M = Mesmerizing!,"Fritz Lang's ""M"" took me by surprise completely! It is one of those amazing motion pictures which holds the audience in their grasp and never lets go. And when it is finally over, it refuses to exit the mind and forces the viewer to constantly think about what he/she has just seen! I wasn't expecting much, but I was more than satisfied when I was finished with this timeless classic. I have watched countless films, but this is one story that is definitely unique. It is one of those films which will leave the viewer in two minds about who to sympathize with..and puts him/her in (for lack of a better expression) a true moral dilemma! Peter Lorre delivers a bravura performance as a child murderer who is the center of this whole drama involving everyone from the police to the families who lose their children to even the underworld! That is pretty much all that can be said about the plot of this gem which has to be seen to be believed. This also happens to be Lang's first talkie film and is probably one of the greatest films ever made about a pathological serial killer. True, due to the era it was released in(1931), it lacks some of the finesse that is used in ""creating"" a motion picture in today's times. But that hardly mars the overall viewing experience. There are some great movie moments, masterfully shot sequences and nail-biting proceedings in the narrative combined with great display of acting from Peter Lorre, as mentioned earlier, along with some commendable supporting acts from Otto Wernicke as Inspector Lohmann and Gustaf Gr«¨ndgens as Schr«œnker. Go ahead and rent/buy this and treat yourself to a wholly satisfying movie experience! Highly recommended!  "
79656,tt0075314,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,God's Lonely Man,"Martin Scorsese's ""Taxi Driver"" has got to be the most interesting character study I've ever seen. Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro), a former Marine living in New York City is a depressed loner with almost no friends except for the handful few he makes during his taxi-driving stint. He is also an insomniac who chooses to drive a taxi during nights mostly, because he can't sleep. During the days and during his time off, he spends his time in seedy movie theaters playing pornographic movies. While driving his taxi in the night on the streets of New York City, Travis encounters a wide variety of passengers. In the first half hour he describes his experiences with his passengers and we even get to see one interesting episode with a particular passenger played by none other than the great director of this film himself! All these experiences have left Travis disillusioned about the world as he knows it. He narrates to the audience that there is a lot of ""scum"" and ""filth"" in the streets. He drives around some of the seediest areas of Manhattan during hours when all the sex-workers and hoodlums roam the streets. Travis is still not entirely pessimistic, though, as he narrates in the voice-over: ""Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets."" In the midst of all this filth, Travis gets to meet the beautiful 'Betsy' (Cybill Shepherd) who is a campaign volunteer Senator Charles Palantine, but his joy is short-lived. Things take a different turn during the final hour of the film, which I will surely not spoil here for the viewer. Robert De Niro delivers one of the greatest performances of his career and makes Travis Bickle one of the most memorable on-screen characters. He is an absolute treat to watch, as he practically becomes Travis Bickle and also makes one wonder if this is the same man who played the young Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather Part II"" not very long ago. Of the supporting cast, Harvey Keitel is superb as ""Sport"", the pimp. Jodie Foster makes a strong impression in one of her earliest screen roles as the teenage prostitute, Iris, even though she gets very little screen time. Cybill Shepherd and Peter Boyle both do justice to their roles as Betsy and ""the Wizard"" respectively. Martin Scorsese appears for a short time and shows his ample acting skills in a scene which is perhaps one of the best director cameos ever. Paul Schrader writes a superb script with one of the most interesting characters ever written for the screen. Equally interesting are his bizarre experiences and his eventual extreme reaction to the disturbing reality he has grown sick of seeing around him. Martin Scorsese directs with the kind of finesse that is expected of him. No other film I've seen, visually details the dark underbelly of New York City as effectively as ""Taxi Driver"". The director shows you some of the sleaziest places in the City full of pimps and prostitutes roaming around. Then there are some mean hoods who come out in numbers at night. You are also taken inside a porn theater with very little seating space and shabby looking interiors and projection screen, where Travis spends his spare time. Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the saxophone in the main title is so mesmerizing, the music combined with the disturbing images in the film refuse to let go and keep echoing in your head long after the film is over. ""Taxi Driver"" is a haunting portrayal of ""God's Lonely Man"". It is the kind of film that demands repeated viewings and grows on you. This film is certainly not for everyone, considering it is really character-driven and not plot-driven. People who are looking for mere entertainment are likely to be disappointed. For others, who are lovers of some serious art cinema, ""Taxi Driver"" is a must-watch and a must-own!  "
80532,tt0056172,Aditya Gokhale,india,8,A saga of epic proportions..,"Lawrence of Arabia had been on my must-watch movies list for a long time. There was so much I had heard and read about it. A lot had been written about this epic saga of T.E. Lawrence as being one of the greatest and most influential films of all time, revered by many great directors including Martin Scorsese. I finally got a chance to see it recently, and considering all the good things I had heard about it, I must admit that my expectations were quite high. ""Lawrence of Arabia"" tells the story of Lt. Colonel T.E. Lawrence, focussing on his war experiences in Arabia during World War I. A topic of such vast proportions needed an equally ambitious project to pull it off, and indeed, the filmmakers have put in a lot of efforts in painting this huge canvas and achieving what they'd set out to. Peter O'Toole plays the eponymous T.E. Lawrence. The film starts out with the accidental death of T.E. Lawrence in the present. The film then flashes back to narrate the story of how Lawrence was sent on a mission to evaluate the situation in Arabia, pertaining to Prince Faisal and his revolt against the Ottoman Turks. Rest of the film then shows Lawrence's own involvement in leading the Arabs in the battle against Turks. So needless to say, you are presented with extravagant battle scenes, and long, never-ending desert treks, Lawrence's new-found friendships, his emotional ups and downs and some difficult choices that he is presented with. The director heavily indulges in showing off the beautifully shot desert landscapes (with the excellent Super Panavision 70 cinematography by Freddie Young). ""Lawrence of Arabia"" lived up to my expectations during most of its long running time. In fact a lot more during the first two hours of the film. But something happened in the final act. Somehow the whole film seemed to go a bit awry and disoriented for some reasons which I am finding difficult to put in words. Suffice to say that it wasn't the overwhelming experience I thought it would be. For one, I think the film could have easily been cut short. A lot of time has been spent on desert treks and their long journeys through it. Yes, these scenes do require detail to show the hardships these men must've faced while crossing those perilous desert lands. But I somehow feel the director went too far in his attempt. So much so that the events taking place in the final 30-45 minutes seem too abrupt and disconnected. There have been films as long as this and longer, but they have enough substance to fill those long hours. There are sufficient examples ('The Godfather Part II', 'Schindler's List', 'Seven Samurai' to name a few). ""Lawrence of Arabia"" has enough substance, yes, but a running time of 216 minutes, was simply not necessary. That aside, the film, of course has plenty of plusses: As mentioned earlier, Freddie Young's cinematography is superb, so is Maurice Jarre's inspirational score. David Lean does a great job in directing this script by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, but falls a little short of expectations in terms of distribution of the content. Nonetheless, this was in itself a magnificent, ambitious project and a difficult one at that, so it is not fair to nitpick too much. The cast: Peter O'Toole's performance is widely talked about. For me, frankly it was somewhat inconsistent. Not to take away any merits from the Legendary actor's acting talent. He was, in fact, great in some scenes. But I was slightly put off by the sometimes nervous, sometimes excessively confident behaviour. Then there were some scenes in which he went way over the top in displaying his emotions. Maybe it was the director who wanted O'Toole to act like that and O'Toole gave the director what he wanted. The supporting cast is great, especially Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn and Alec Guiness. I had seen Anthony Quinn in Fellini's ""La Strada"" earlier and it was great to see him display such versatility. All said, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" is a great film, but falls a tad short of being a masterpiece in my book. However, it definitely deserves to be watched at least once by any serious lover of cinema.

84992,tt0062622,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,The Ultimate Sci-Fi Experience! OR The Godfather of all Sci-Fi Films....,"Standing Ovation, please, Ladies and Gentlemen! Here's presenting you the finest Sci-fi adventure you will ever have the fortune of experiencing! I am not very much a fan of Sci-fi films, but I must admit I was blown away by this 1968 Stanley Kubrick + Arthur C. Clarke venture called ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". An exception is the 1979 Ridley Scott Classic, ""Alien"" which is a close second! But ""2001..."" takes the cake and outshines them all! This is arguably Kubrick's career-best work as a director! Saying or mentioning anything about the plot/concept is sacrilege. This film is best left to the audience to experience without any prior knowledge. Suffice to say, it is a dazzling movie-viewing experience, one best enjoyed with the fullest advantage of sight and sound, i.e. best watched in the dark, on a considerably big screen, with stereophonic sound. Stanley Kubrick has achieved through special sets and photographic effects, what none of the other film-makers of later years have achieved even with the best of CGI. The Oscar for Best Special/Visual effects was well-deserved..only I wish he had won for Best Director too. The acting by the actors who play the three central characters, Keir Dullea (Dr. Dave Bowman), Gary Lockwood (Dr. Frank Poole) and William Sylvester (Dr. Heywood Floyd) is quite good, if not great. But quite frankly, acting is not the department the film is trying to excel in. What it tries to achieve and succeeds brilliantly in, is to try and tell the story that it intends to tell in the most innovative manner ever! Quite possibly ""2001.."" would've turned out to be just another sci-fi film had it been made by a lesser director. The film has a certain aura about it, which may perhaps have been missing had it not been for Kubrick's involvement! Who else would've had the guts or the vision to use classical music and the sound of silence with some heavy breathing as a background score to this film..with minimal use of dialog!? There is some brilliant music by Johann Strauss (On The Beautiful Blue Danube) in the film which perfectly complements the ""Space Odyssey"" scenes! And then there is the now legendary ""Also Sprach Zarathustra (Thus Spake Zarathustra)"" theme by Richard Strauss which appears during some of the key scenes in the film. Also worth mentioning are the spacey soundscapes used in certain other key scenes. One can't help but be reminded of Pink Floyd's psychedelic days from the late 60s. No wonder then, that Pink Floyd were actually approached to perform music for this film (They, however, turned the offer down!). As mentioned earlier, the Visual effects and special photographic effects by Kubrick, Douglas Trumbull and team is extraordinary! Such a feat was never done before, nor was it achieved later.. It is little wonder then, that Kubrick ordered all prints of unused scenes, sets, props, miniatures, and production blueprints destroyed. The screenplay penned together by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke is brilliant.. The fantastic score and finally the Godly directorial work of Stanley Kubrick make this film an experience of a lifetime.. Buy this film..it is one of those rare films which deserve a place in a time capsule buried to be discovered by future generations....  "
89956,tt0086250,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,You wanna play rough?? OKAY!,"Scarface has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release. It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind 'The Godfather'. But it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as ""tackiness"" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the ""remake""! Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time! There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental. There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother's. About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what ""Scarface"" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn't be as effective without him! Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend Manny. Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role. Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role. The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling. ""Scarface"" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!  "
99434,tt0071315,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,Fantastic!,"I can't believe I never saw this earlier. Great movie..although made in 1974, this one leaves all the so-called suspense movies of today far behind!! This is probably one of the best detective stories I've seen on screen. Brilliant acting by Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway (she looks beautiful!). A very engaging story, doesn't let up, and there is not a single wasted moment! Throughout the movie, some seemingly irrelevant dialogue will make complete sense as you progress towards the end. I don't want to say much, but this one is not to be missed. Polanski's best; a treat for lovers of mystery movies.  "
100524,tt0457430,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,The Labyrinth experience...,"There are very few films which provide a viewing experience which is riveting as well as moving at the same time. Guillermo Del Toro takes us to another world in his masterpiece, Pan's Labyrinth, which is perhaps the best film he has ever made. I have seen his earlier works like The Devil's Backbone which was a decent watch, and Cronos, which I hated! But I was awestruck by what I saw in Pan's Labyrinth, a haunting film which is difficult to get out of your head long after you've finished watching. Revealing much about the plot will take out most of the fun of watching the movie. But just to make a mention, the story is set in post-Civil War Spain in 1944. Ofelia, a little girl, along with her pregnant mother travel to the mountains to join her stepfather, Captain Vidal where his military outfit is in the process of exterminating guerrillas. Shortly, Ofelia comes across an old Labyrinth in which she meets a faun, who gives her some very interesting information. And then, amidst the conflict between the guerrillas and the Captain's army, Ofelia finds herself getting into a rather mysterious adventure.... Technically, Pan's Labyrinth scores in almost every department. The background score by Javier Navarrete is superb and brilliantly haunting. Guillermo Navarro's cinematography is fantastic and perfectly brings out the bleak atmosphere to go with the proceedings of the story. And of course, there's some frighteningly well-done special effects and makeup effects by David Marti' and others. Performances from all of the cast are wonderful. Most notably, of course, Ivana Baquero, Sergi L«¸pez and Maribel Verd«ß. Lopez is so good as the ruthless Captain, that you cannot help but loathe him! Ivana turns in a poetic performance as Ofelia, the lead character. Likewise Maribel Verdu as Mercedes, the housekeeper. Pan's Labyrinth, as rightly described by Guillermo Del Toro, is a fairy tale for adults. It has it's fair share of violence and some gruesome scenes which may be difficult for the squeamish to watch. But this movie deserves to be watched by one and all. It is one of those tales of finding hope amidst despair, but quite different in many ways from all other films with a similar message. The acclaim this film received is well-deserved. Do not miss!  "
104771,tt0112641,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,Criminally Under-acknowledged! Definitely one of Scorsese's best.,"Casino is not even on the top 250. It's a pity, what with so many lame movies getting much higher ratings. Wonderfully directed by Martin Scorsese, this epic tale (based on real life incidents) unfolds with the story of Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (Robert De Niro) a mob-backed guy who is brought in to Las Vegas to operate the Tangiers Casino, owing to his expertise in the same. His boyhood pal, Nicky Santoro (Joe Pesci) also moves to Vegas with criminal plans of his own. Sam does his job really well, exposing cheats, disposing of the weaker employees, making sure he isn't robbed of money, and ends up making big bucks for his mob bosses ""back home"". However, things change when Sam falls for Ginger (Sharon Stone), a hustler. She already has a no-good boyfriend Lester (James Woods, in a small albeit important role). Inspite of his knowledge about her manipulative nature, he marries her. She is an alcoholic, and all she ever wants is money and security. Meanwhile, Nicky continues his criminal activities. ""Casino"" is, without doubt one of the best films by Scorsese. The film runs for almost three hours and events take their time to unravel, and rightly so. The performances: Robert De Niro is one of the finest actors to come out of Hollywood and that's a universal fact! In this movie, he delivers a performance that qualifies as one his best after 'Raging Bull'. He appears super-cool as the Casino operator and you cannot help but sympathize with him in some later parts of the movie when he is having a bad time because of various reasons. Trust him to play an all-in-one character: a mob-connected Casino guy, a friend and a loving father all at the same time! His powerful performance in this movie has to be seen to be believed. It is nothing short of mind-blowing! Joe Pesci..what can one say about this guy! Delivering sharp dialogs and firing those F-words with a one-of-a-kind punch is something only he can do! He plays a wicked, wicked character who also cares for his boy-hood friend, Sam. Another brilliant performance after GoodFellas, he is the finest choice for his role. Sharon Stone: Superb!! I never thought I would feel that about her performance, but indeed, she gets a hell of a chance to act here..and she does it exceedingly well! The drunk hustler who cannot find happiness is played to perfection by Sharon...I guess it is also kudos to the director for bringing out the actor in her. Then there are some wonderful, but small supporting performances by James Woods as Lester Diamond, Frank Vincent as Frank Marino, Alan King as Andy Stone and Kevin Pollak (The Usual Suspects) as Phillip Green. Special mention here, of Pasquale Cajano, who is superb as the mob boss, Remo Gaggi. The soundtrack is very much like that in GoodFellas. And much in the same manner, there is some playful rock'n'roll music playing in the background during any violent scene of crime! The dialog is brilliant. Robert Richardson's cinematography is amazing. The wonderful screenplay for the film is co-written by Nicolas Pileggi who is also the author of the book. As mentioned before, the film runs for about 3 hours but there is not a single moment when you'd want to take your eyes off the screen. An under-rated classic, this one deserves a rightful place up there along with Scorsese's other acclaimed classics.  "
105089,tt0055031,Aditya Gokhale,india,9,Gripping!,"I did not think much of Kramer's previous courtroom drama, ""Inherit the Wind"" which also starred Spencer Tracy. But the mere premise and ensemble starcast of ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" was reason enough to rent this film and give it a shot. Inspired by true events, this fictionalized account of the trials stars Spencer Tracy as Judge Dan Haywood who is supposed to give judgement in the trial of four Nazi judges who have been charged with crimes against humanity. They have been accused of twisting the law during the Nazi regime and helping the government to put away some socially undesirable individuals and also advocating and permitting the forceful sexual sterilization of some others. One of these judges is Ernst Janning, played by a sad-faced and silent Burt Lancaster, who has once been a much respected figure in the ministry of justice. Books published by him, still being used in some universities, Judge Haywood is baffled about how a man who values justice so much, can be responsible for such heinous acts of brutality. What follows is a gripping courtroom battle of wits between the prosecuting attorney, Col. Lawson (Richard Widmark) and Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell). Amidst all this courtroom chaos, Judge Haywood himself has some experiences of his own, when he is not sitting on the judge's chair, getting acquainted with German people who have lived to see the ghastly past of the Nazi regime, yet seem to be completely oblivious to most of the details, including the holocaust. Stanley Kramer does a great job of directing this film written by Abby Mann. Ernst Gold's original music nicely complements some other German traditional music used in this film, particularly the group singing in bars. The performances: Great..all of them. Special mention, though, about: Spencer Tracy: Excellent as Judge Haywood who is clearly taken aback on how some of the ""good"" Germans he has come to be acquainted with in his short stay can claim to not have any knowledge about the war crimes and holocaust in the Nazi regime. Burt Lancaster: Wonderful portrayal of the sad-eyed Dr. Ernst Janning full of regret for the acts he has been accused of committing. Marlene Dietrich: Great as the widow of a German soldier who was executed. Maximilian Schell: The most scene-stealing performance of them all. He gets some of the most powerful scenes to chew on and pulls it off brilliantly! Last but not the least, the ""single-scene stealers"" as I call them, these actors took my breath away in their very brief appearances: Judy Garland as Irene Hoffman and Montgomery Clift as Rudolf Petersen. Splendid performances, both of them! Academy Award nominations, well-deserved. This film runs more than three hours long, and may require some patience on part of the viewer for all the verbose courtroom proceedings.

120513,tt0084787,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,John Carpenter's best!,"This is, what John Carpenter calls, his first movie in his Apocalypse Trilogy. The second was Prince of Darkness (1987) and the final one was In the Mouth of Madness (1995). ""The Thing"" is Carpenter's most terrifying movie till date. Some research scientists in the isolated Antarctic encounter a deadly shape-changing alien, who absorbs other organisms in order to create a perfect imitation. This alien attempts to take over this doomed team of scientists one by one. There is not a single boring moment in this movie. The narrative is smooth. The atmosphere throughout the movie is very tense and suspenseful. The acting from most of the cast is amazing, with special mention of, Kurt Russel and Keith David. The display of paranoia from all the characters/actors is nothing short of brilliant! It really convinces the viewer that no one can be trusted! Other aspects: The score is wonderful and haunting. The gore effects are of course, fantastic, as the reader might already know! All in all, a great package; a true horror classic. Enjoy!  "
141595,tt0246578,Aditya Gokhale,india,10,One of the most original movies of the decade so far....,"Here's how the movie begins...a teenager who's on medication walks in his sleep and meets a giant bunny rabbit. This rabbit tells Donnie to do various deeds of vandalism. Sounds stupid? Hardly...! You'll know what I mean if you sit through this incredibly riveting drama full of brilliance! Superficially ""Donnie Darko"" would seem to be a story of a troubled teen who hallucinates. But as the story progresses, you begin to realize that its something much more complex and unimaginable! The movie is, as the reader must already know (if he/she has heard about it), very difficult to comprehend in the first attempt. This is one of those movies that require repeated viewing, but it hardly bores the viewer, because it has so much new to offer in each viewing! As you watch it over you will notice the finer points you missed in the preceding viewing. Great acting from Jake Gyllenhaal and the supporting crew. If possible, rent the theatrical edition DVD first. Although the Director's Cut has been criticized, it will facilitate better understanding of the movie; yet, keep it as a second choice. Donnie Darko is one of the most original movies I have ever seen, and is a must-see. Highly recommended.  "
66551,tt1345836,Aditya Iyer,British Indian Ocean Territory,10,The Legend ends but the Legacy continues!,"To start with just one word - Magnificent? Awesome? Epic? Flawless? Well in this case all of them! Nolan truly outdid himself this time, more than what he did with The Dark Knight in 2008. After being fortunate to attend a special premier screening before the rest of the world, for the entire duration of the movie I was just glued to my seat without giving a dam what was happening anywhere else. Right from the opening credits till the end, the movie was just mind blowing. They plot is simply awesome, one of the best stories ever told, and certainly for a comic book movie - a cool adaptation of the graphic novels of The Dark Knight Returns and No Man's Land and of course from the Knightfall story arc. Being a comic book fan I got blown away as the movie continued and each time the entire place went in an uproar. If you have read the comics one would love it even more, otherwise the plot is so well written with so much twists, humour at well unexpected places and great moments that anyone would be blown away. Action - now this is the other major part. As having more than an hour of IMAX shooting, the movie truly lives up to its Action and War film genres. Despite sitting for ~3 hour it felt the movie got over very soon. Such is the intensity you can hope to be totally hooked into. Acting was a class apart. Tom Hardy's Bane was indeed terrifying living up to his reputation; Gary Oldman's Gordon, Joseph Gordon-Levitt's Blake and Michael Cain's Alfred were very well made characters, emotional and core to the plot. Anne Hathaway made a really cool Catwoman, her screen time was full of awesome moments. And lets not forget the main Batman, Bale's BEST performance yet. Hans Zimmer also really outdid himself like Nolan in terms of the music score. So the conclusion is: 10/10 The most common and sort of obvious debate will be The Dark Knight vs. The Dark Knight Rises. Well I'd say I love both the movies, but saying one ""better"" than the other is not exactly right, rather I would say The Dark Knight Rises is bigger and more grand. Hope that helps. One of the best movies in decades literally. MUST watch.  "
4797,tt0068646,Aditya Kannan,united states,10,One of the best films I have seen,"What can I say about this masterpiece. Few words can describe The Godfather. This film is an excellent adaptation of the best seller novel. I have read the book and seen the film. I loved both, though the book is better since it gives more insight into the Italian mafia. But the movie is great.  I love crime dramas and gangster films. The Godfather was very well crafted. I come from India and many film directors love this film. In 2005 an Indian filmmaker made ""Sarkar"" which is inspired from The Godfather. Sarkar was good but nothing beats The Godfather. It is magnificent and hugely entertaining. No one can beat Mr.Francis Ford Coppola's version.  When it comes to the performances everyone do a great job. Marlon Brando and Al Pacino are the best in the film. Their performances have and will always inspire upcoming actors anywhere in the world. They live their characters as no one else. It is sad that Pacino never won an Oscar for any of The Godfather films. James Caan and Richard Castellino are very good as Sonny and Clemenza respectively.  All in all, this is a worldwide film, not to be missed by any person who loves good cinema. This will remain one of my favorites. "
44411,tt0816692,Aditya Mehta,united states,10,Interstellar,"Interstellar ""'Do not go gentle into that good night...'"" Interstellar is, for a lot of reasons, an important study of space and time -- not just for the adventurers on the screen, but for myself. Upon my initial viewing of Christopher Nolan's ode to ""2001,"" I found myself walking in with unfairly excessive (i.e. unmeetable) expectations -- sugarplum fairy dreams of a cinematic masterpiece -- and walking out mildly disappointed. So, I stepped away from the film and decided, once the hype -- both internal and external -- had died down, that I'd revisit it once more several weeks later. Space and time. And that's when I discovered not necessarily what I was hoping for, but what it was -- Interstellar is a small study of love performed on a grand stage of discovery. An epic study of people told against a backdrop of their desperate attempt to survive, this is a Nolan we've never seen before, and I hope to one day see again. As gorgeous as the eye-melting visuals are (not to mention the docking scene which probably is the best scene of the year), this is a movie about the relationship between a father and his child -- and the tragedy, hope and loss it must endure in order to survive. Whether it's the most important relationships in our lives or just a movie, sometimes the things we care about don't turn out the way we want them to -- and that's a good thing. Sometimes they just need space and time.  "
53355,tt2582802,Aditya Mehta,united states,9,Whiplash,"Whiplash ""There are no two words more harmful in the English language than 'Good job.'"" Talent is the gateway drug to misery. In the most ferociously terrifying film in years, a young jazz drummer spends his days working for the opportunity to study under an acclaimed instructor at one of the country's most elite music schools. When he finally lands a spot, he's dealt a savagely vicious reminder to be careful what you wish for. Thus begins Whiplash. Easily 2014's best film, this is a cinematic manifestation of the barbarity, cruelty and depravity that arise from unyielding ambition. The never ending quest to be the best is one that often leaves its traveler with bumps and bruises rather than fame and fortune. WHIPLASH is unyielding and unrelenting in its journey of sacrifice and self-improvement ∂? and writer/director Damien Chazelle hits each beat with a confidence and stride of a filmmaker with ten times his experience. And then there's Mile Teller and J.K. Simmons ∂? the most awe inspiring cinematic pairing in years. Through blood, sweat and tears, these two tear through the screen with a raw bloodthirstiness that you can neither bear watching nor rip your eyes away from. Their embodiment of wicked electricity boils over onto the screen in a way that no two other actors could have accomplished. Whiplash is everything movies are supposed to be about: high wire emotions, acutely fleshed characters and a story that leaves you both exhausted and wanting more. That's why Whiplash is the best film of the year. So harmful or not, I'm going to say it. Good job.  "

From the beginning the place had no people but there were loads of rich food that made Chihiro's parents eat them.

The film has a simple enough storyline but still manages to be refreshing due to it's intelligent packaging and presentation. The voice acting is fantastic, the background score is very nice, the editing is slick and the 3-D effects are beautiful.

Hmm, but no doubts about the 2 minute gap. That's reserved for machines. Curves of metal, humming engines and the adrenaline. This week at the movies, Ron Howard's 'Rush' pays tribute to the Man- Machine relationship and it doesn't get more intimate than this. Rush is inspired by real life rivalry between Formula 1 racers James Hunt (Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl). Them ruled the tracks in the 70's and it was their riff that kept them ahead. The film boasts of well written and performed characters. Hunt is a partying brat, a womanizer who believes in enjoying the life to the fullest. Niki Lauda on the other hand is a complete contrast. He's disciplined, knows his tech inside out and being the son of a businessman, knows the economics of the trade. One's a British and the other a German, even the accents are different. The only thing common between the two is the passion to drive, and unconditional love towards their machines. Its a simple story of these drivers trying to beat each other with their rivalry acting as the main catalyst. Look out for their interesting verbal conflicts for lighter moments. Now for the hero of the film. Cinematographer Anthony Dodd Mantle takes us to places where no one has ever been. Close ups of axle joints, acceleration pedals, exhausts of the engine breathing fire and screeching tires as the cars move at the speed of 170 mph are breathtaking. Especially the starting of the last race in Tokyo where the tracks are wet after rain, the first skid of the tires are shown in slow motion throwing water droplets away from its periphery. I mentioned intimacy, didn't I? All he does is use his experience of handling primitive digital cameras right from the days of Dogme95. Never has being seated in a cinema hall been so thrilling.

Is violence justified only because it will help bring them back from hand of the evil? 'Prisoners' which released in India two weeks later than America is a must watch had anyone missed the chills and atmospherics of thriller classics such as 'Se7en' and 'Zodiac'. Its the story of a desperate father taking matters into his own hands after his daughter and her friend go missing and the police discharges the prime suspect in the case. Directed by Denis Villeneuve, the film provides an introspection on our moral grounds at times when evil lurks around. Touching the themes of torture and violence, it is an engaging (at the same time - disturbing) drama. The contorted twist towards the end turns it into a thrilling mystery leaving us puzzled as looking for answers. Supported by a brilliant caste, the pace of the screenplay gets an uplift by their natural stance and the brilliance of their performance delivery. Hugh Jackman as the father and Jake Gyllenhaal as the frustrated lead investigator prove to be the perfect choice for the roles. Paul Dano as Alex Jones - the prime suspect plays his character so profoundly that we will hate and pity him at the same time. Stark photography by 10 times Oscar nominee Roger Deakins provides the atmospherics and the chills that completely draws us into the drama set in cold and bleak streets. With 'Rush' released the week before and 'Prisoners' matching up, maybe the Oscar season has already started.  "
66084,tt1345836,aditya5847,singapore,8,A trilogy to remember,"The Godfather series fumbled on the third one, Sam Raimi disappointed in the third Spiderman. LOTR perhaps was one of select few movie trilogies which managed to impress throughout. Three is the tricky number and The Dark Knight Rises aspires to pull it off with panache. Set 8 years after the events of the last movie, it picks up after peace has descended on Gotham City and Batman has retired. But in the words of Selina Kyle: ""There is a storm coming"". Enter Bane and havoc reigns in Gotham City. Batman is forced to come out of retirement and face the demons, both - the ones roaming outside and the ones buried inside. Naming the movie The Dark Knight Rises was a bold step in my opinion. It will constantly remind the people that this is a follow up to the really great The Dark Knight. Expectations will be high. And to a very large extent, Chris Nolan delivers. The first half of the movie is a tad bit slow and builds up characters, both old and new. The second half moves into the execution of Bane's plans for Gotham and once the excitement picks up it refuses to let you down. I caught myself with an open mouth, goosebumps, edge of the seat etc at various points in the family. The storyline is riveting and the plan this time is much grander than the The Dark Knight. It is all very exciting to watch it all unfold, culminating into a memorable climax. We explore characters in depth and yet do not feel like that there are too many dull moments. The performances are really good, I especially liked Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance as a hot headed cop. The others in the cast: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman are pros and deliver their best, as is expected of them. Tom Hardy delivers a very physical performance and perhaps falls just slightly short of the very entertaining Joker of Heath Ledger. Anne Hathway is impressive in a physically demanding role and looks every bit convincing as the femme fatale. Nolan goes for grand here, and you can see that in the set design, the storyline, the screenplay everything. Hans Zimmer delivers another brilliant score. You cannot help chanting ""Deshi Bashara"" under your breath along with the film. The only shortcoming is the slower first half and some(very few) of Bane's dialogues not being quite clear.  "

The kind of drama and emotion he shows in his movies we see in every second Hindi movie in which hero never lost. Now I will start with the end of TDKR which is again similar to Hindi movie (Agent Vinod). Because of death of heath ledger the director has to create a base of movie which takes first 30-45 minutes of the movie (which is slightly more than needed). Anne Hathaway is unnecessarily put in the movie which is not expected from the Christopher Nolan. Morgan freeman, Gary Oldman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Michael Caine done full justice with their characters. No one can understand what the hell Liam Nesson is doing in this movie and how Christian Bale able to see him (Because he died in first part). Can anyone tell me how Christian Bale can see him.

Its a deadly cocktail of 10 star story and 10 star acting. Before anything I would like to confess that I bought the book almost 6 months back and read only 50 pages and got busy in life. Am not much into fiction, I only repent I should have read the book. FYI - A book paints a much awesome picture than what any movie can ever do. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is another such example. Thankfully I read the book and saw the movie. Ya, in that order. Back to Gone Girl. As the title suggests, its a story of a girl who goes missing. And this girl AMY (played by Rosamund Pike) is Nick's (Ben Affleck) wife. What really happened to her? Did someone kidnap her? Did Nick himself kill her? Did the marriage go bad? Phew, the story take such interesting turns that I cannot tell you anything beyond this. Frankly, storyline makes or breaks a movie. This book written by the great Gillian Flynn will only make you think hard how these people can write such stuff! How can you think of such complex plots! I wish I had more imagination to write such beautiful suspense stories! :) Ben Affleck is considered one of the best actors in the Hollywood and rightly so. Have you seen 'ARGO'? You better watch it if you have not, if you have already done it, you should watch it multiple times. I do that. He is a genius. This movie will go in my library of frequently watched movies. Just so you know, 'Gone Girl' has been directed by David Fincher, the same person who gave us 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo' (its a masterpiece, you should watch it), 'Social Network' (again an awesome movie) and the blockbuster 'The curious Case of Benjamin Button'. David is a super director. Every department in the movie gets a 5 star! Lets talk about the girl herself who goes missing! Rosamund Pike is a phenomenal actor. I remember her from 'Die Another Day' and 'Jack Reacher'. Her acting in this movie is unparalleled. If I tell you any more, I will be dishonouring the disclaimer above! :) Go watch this two and half hour epic. If you sit relaxed for even a minute during the entire movie duration, I will pay your ticket money back. Yup, that's how good it is.

Manoj Bajpai acted well and the direction was good but the way the story was presented was disgusting. The movie has been added with too much Mirch Masala and the worst part about it was the crowd in the theaters. Due to some sensitive issues, people were fighting in the cinema halls itself.

I loved bring my son to the re-release in 1997, and being able to share it with him. Even though he was only just over two, that kid was glued to the screen for the whole time...and wanted to go see Empire and Return of the Jedi. I look forward to the 3D versions that are rumored to be coming out next year in 2007 for the 30th anniversary ( I can't believe it has been almost 30 years). I also look forward to sharing this movie with my grandchildren one day. This is one movie that will be around to the end of time...a true classic.  "
140289,tt0046911,adk-10,united states,10,The best mystery movie ever made,"I saw this flick when it was first released in US. The language was French with English subtitles. The subtitles were more of a distraction than a help in following the plot. Most of the people who review this movie don't seem to understand what it is about. It is not a horror flick, as many claim. Pure and simple it is a murder mystery, and the best i have ever seen. Hitchcock is the master mystery director. In my view his best was ""Psycho"". However, ""Diabolique"" is at another level. What made ""Psycho"" great was that it used many of the plot and cinematic effects of ""Diabolique"". Did Hitchcock ever acknowledge Clouzot's contribution? I also think that ""Diabolique"" was Simone Signoret's best work, of course most critics would strongly disagree. The 90's remake was a travesty.  "

84713,tt0062622,adlawn,United States,9,"Mesmerizing, Not Boring","Here's what stood out to me: 1. The music. On the one hand, duh. On the other, have you actually listened to ""On the Beautiful Blue Danube"" recently? It's 10+ minutes of constant enjoyment -- every melody is beautiful. Of course, another Strauss also has his moments. What most intrigued me, though, were the selections by Gy«Ùrgy Ligeti. I don't usually appreciate atonal or unmelodic pieces, but the ""monolith theme"" is an awesome blend of the haunting, intense, and otherworldly. Notably, Kubrick commissioned a score by Alex North but then decided to use the classical recordings he had been playing during production -- without telling North. 2. The new bone. At the end of ""The Dawn of Man"" chapter, the triumphant tool-user throws his tapir bone (which he just used to beat the life out of a rival hominid) into the air, and the scene artfully cuts from the bone to its modern counterpart: a white, cylindrical nuclear device orbiting the earth. That's deep. Or maybe I'm just a sucker for a good transition. 3. The visual realism. The space exploration special effects hold up remarkably well considering that the film turns 40(!) this year. Not only do they look realistic, they also illustrate Kubrick's attention to procedural detail. He uses extended shots of relatively mundane activities in order to give us a sense of what it's like in the vacuum and how exactly people get things done. 4. The computer. HAL's got a great voice (he's going to sing ""Fitter Happier"" in my remake). And his lines aren't half-bad, either. If only his shipmates weren't so wooden and...mechanical. (Was Kubrick trying to say something about astronauts -- that the government preferred unimaginative military men to a fault?) If I were on board, I'd've picked his brain nonstop. A conscious computer would never get old. Forget chess -- imagine having a conversation about philosophy, or anything else for that matter. What would you talk about? 5. The end. What's the deal? The protracted light show screams ""we've got to do something with all these FX shots,"" especially when the colored landscapes kick in after what I thought would be the climax (when everything appears to be culminating in a burst of white light). And then there's the bizarre room sequence. I won't spoil it; I'll just speculate: is this how the aliens wanted Dave to perceive his transformation? Or is it Kubrick reminding us that 2001 is an art film, infinitely beyond trashy sci-fi?  "
101967,tt0089881,adlawn,united states,3,"Laboriously Made, Laborious to Watch","Ran is a second-rate retelling of the Lear story, so the flaws in the plot are easiest to explain with reference to King Lear. These are some of the important differences: the subplot is dropped; Goneril and Regan are turned into effete men; an injured and vengeful daughter-in-law is introduced; the Lear-figure (Hidetora) is a warlord rather than a king; the mad Lear scene is weakened to insignificance; the sons try to kill old Hidetora by having a few thousand men fire at him as he sits in a castle; and the additional character of Tsurumaru, a boy who was blinded by Hidetora at some point in his murderous career, is introduced. Hidetora is a smaller man than Lear; he has the stubbornness without the nobility. His abdication is also a lot sillier. Lear errs by trusting that people will treat him decently: Hidetora errs by supposing that they will forget that they hate him. This is also much more implausible. After all, there is nothing monstrous or unnatural about the daughter-in-law's attitude towards Hidetora; she just wants her back, and with reason. This diminishes her, and in spite of Kurosawa's attempt to make her a sex maniac, she is not as large or as interesting as Goneril/Regan. Unlike Lear, Ran does not give us a sense of the insignificance of Man in nature. The ""majestic"" (read pompous) scenery shots don't make us feel that Man in general is helpless∂?these are no giants to be dwarfed by Nature, just a murderer and an injured woman and several wimps. The strong stoical undertone of Lear is lost for obvious reasons. Samurai cannot be stoics; they are people who are trained to kill themselves whenever the going gets inglorious. It is amusing but not profound that Hidetora cannot find a dagger to kill himself with when the need arises. So what's left of Lear? Only this: People in the world are evil. If you hurt them they'll hurt you when they can. You should be good even if you suffer (like the blind boy), because general goodness and suffering are the only way to avoid family feuds and make the world a better place. Which is all very edifying, but also very trite. It must also be noted that because of the lingering, ponderous, ""epic"" pacing of this film, it goes on for twice as long as it should. What to expect: 160 minutes of intense tedium as this misshapen hulk of a film drags itself laboriously towards its predictable close. Watching Ran is like running for your life for 2 hours and 40 minutes, but with none of the excitement.  "

It's visually pleasing with all of the camera angles and kung fu scenes, humorously macabre (see blood squirt for long times from a severed arm, and consistent with other Tarrantino film themes (murder, revenge, action, power struggles) Those who have written that the Writer/Director has no range with his stories, apparently never read an interview with QT. He is not a coming-of-age movie type guy. His interest lies in movies that inspired him as a youth, and his focus in cinema is on violent, sarcastic, action flicks with smarmy dialogue.

97338,tt0081398,adlei_b,united kingdom,10,Awesome movie,"Some of the comments regarding this film make me scratch my head until I'm scratching bone. This IS a classic movie. Make no mistake. De Niro didn't get an Oscar simply for putting on a lot of weight, his portrayal of Jake La Motta is spot on. De Niro acts the part out in perfect symmetry with La Motta's autobiography. Since when was it important to have characters to whom you can feel sympathy leading the film? Do you feel sympathy for Jeff Bridges in the Big Lebowski? He's a stoned waster doing nothing with his life, but that's a classic. And does every film need to have a message for us? I'd feel a bit offended if every film I payed good money to see attempted to preach some sort of fable down my throat just so I can leave and think I saw a good film. What do West Side Story and the Bourne films teach us? Don't fall in love with someone you shouldn't and don't get involved in illegal Government operations? Why thankyou for telling me. Maybe I'm spending more time challenging this movie's haters rather than bigging it up, but I hope that that reflects positively on the movie. It's worth defending against people who feel hard done by because the movie was too taxing for them. The boxing scenes are amazing in this film, better than any of the boxing scenes in the Rocky films - which are excellent movies as well. La Motta said De Niro could have gone on to become a pro boxer he was so good after training up. The black and white, in my opinion, lends itself perfectly to catching the brutal violence that is central to the movie, spit and blood flying everywhere, impressing on the viewer the visceral nature of boxing and Jake La Motta. He's no hero, but that's no reason not to make a film about him. Great film, great acting from everyone involved - Joe Pesci has some serious napoleon syndrome going on - and an overall entertaining experience. And as for mfplajos's comments, you're an arrogant idiot. Great you have a BA, pat on the back for you. Do you mean to say we should take movie recommendations more seriously if they come from someone with letters after their name?

136946,tt0052311,a-d-man,belgium,9,The ultimate s«∏rie noire," I am not sure how the in 1998 restored director's cut differs from the version I saw on television more than 10 years ago, but a poignant piece of work it is. Touch of Evil (TOE) is best compared to that other archetypical s«∏rie noire, The Maltese Falcon (TMF). In both movies, the characters are bigger than life (in the case of Gutman/Greenstreet and Quinlan/Welles also in the literal sense) but still entirely credible. Janet Leigh is hilarious as the feisty, somewhat idiotic blonde wife. However, the mood is quite different. In TMF, the main character (Spade/Bogart) and even his main opponent seem in control in spite of the occasional setback. Compare this with TOE, in which the events overtake the characters: Vargas/Heston is constantly looking for his wife gone astray, Quinlan/Welles feels so harassed that he turns again to liquor (always a bad omen, see E.G. Robinson in Little Cesar) and loses his characteristic cane (awkward for a cripple), which becomes his undoing. More than TMF, TOE is the ultimate s«∏rie noire.  "
69657,tt0119698,admarple,united states,10,A masterpiece,"Be prepared, I'm going to gush about this movie for a few minutes. Alright. There are so many elements to this movie I enjoyed. The vignette structure makes it feel like an epic set in a larger universe, and yet we still have a narrative tied together by our five major characters. Fortunately, those characters all have both a gradual period of introduction that provides some depth, as well as their own arc. The classic Miyazaki style of animation (with a few touches of CG) sets the stage well and provides for some stunning visuals. The voice work for the English dub does everything I'd hope to keep up with the animation. This movie isn't perfect as a film that uses visual elements to subtly tell a story in as rich a way as possible, but it is perfect as a film that engrosses the viewer in a fantastic universe by sending a hero on an epic quest through that universe.

People from European countries, from USA etc. can see the cruelty of war time that Polish people already know. But the form is almost academic and this is why I have some remarks. First of all: Brody is too young and his play is without feelings, we can feel a big distance between the film director and the film matter (Polanski was a ghetto prisoner!), there is no passion in this movie - like it was in Spielberg's ""Schindler List"".

93972,tt0372784,Admin-470,united states,10,Bravo! Quite simply: the best action-hero film ever.,"Writer/Director Christopher Nolan has finally given Batman the respect he deserves. While the previous franchise films have been humorously entertaining at best, it is only with BATMAN BEGINS that are we treated to a hero with dignity and class. The casting choice of Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne was superb. His dashing good looks are secondary to his talent and depth, which is the true earmark of a bona fide actor. There hasn't been, nor is there currently, any other well-known actor that possesses the versatility, intelligence, charisma, and scintillating power, which Christian Bale possesses. The credit for bringing Christopher Nolan's vision of the Batman character to life *belongs* to him. Add the fine casting choices of Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman, and Mr. Nolan has set the scene for an astounding cinematic feast for **the heart**. Additionally, I suspect newcomer Gus Lewis, as the 8-year-old Bruce, will prove to be quite a talent in the years to come. They were all just brilliant. BATMAN BEGINS doesn't just entertain, it makes one *believe*. It will make you cheer, applaud, cry, laugh, and it will take your breath away! Encore! Encore! Encore!  "
2805,tt0111161,admin-54463,united states,9,Shawshank slows down and looks,"It is an interesting remark to make around a film set inside a jail, yet ""The Shawshank Redemption"" makes a warm hang on our sentiments on the grounds that it makes us an individual from a gang. Numerous films offer us vicarious encounters and brisk, shallow feelings. ""Shawshank"" backs off and looks. It utilizes the storyteller's quiet, perceptive voice to incorporate us in the account of men who have shaped a group in the slammer. It is more profound than most movies; about congruity in a lifetime, in view of companionship and trust.  Fascinating that in spite of the fact that the saint of the film is the indicted previous investor Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the activity is never seen from his perspective. The film's opening scene demonstrates to him being given two lifelong incarcerations for the homicide of his wife and her darling, and after that we move, forever, to a perspective speaking to the jail populace and especially the lifer Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman). It is his voice recollecting the first occasion when he saw Andy (""resembled a solid breeze would blow him over""), and foreseeing, wrongly, that he wouldn't make it in jail.  From Andy's landing on the jail transport to the film's end, we see just how others see him - Red, who turns into his closest companion, Brooks the old curator, the degenerate Warden Norton, gatekeepers and detainees. Red is our surrogate. He's the one we relate to, and the reclamation, when it comes, is Red's. We've been demonstrated by Andy's case that you need to hush up about genuine, not lose trust, wait for your opportunity, set a calm illustration and search for your possibility. ""I get it comes down to a straightforward decision, truly,"" he tells Red. ""Get occupied living' or get occupied dying'."" The way to the film's structure, I believe, is that its not about its legend, but rather about our association with him - our interest, our compassion, our profound respect. On the off chance that Andy had been the chivalrous focus, boldly persevering through, the film would have been traditional, and less baffling. Be that as it may, we ponder about this gentleman. Did he truly execute those two individuals? Why does he remain quiet about to such an extent? Why would he be able to wander through the jail yard like a liberated individual on a walk, when others trudges or steers? Individuals like fervor at the motion pictures, and titles that give it do well. Movies about ""recovery"" are drawn closer with extraordinary watchfulness; many individuals are not excited by the possibility of an awesome film - it seems like work. Be that as it may, there's a crave messages of trust, and when a film offers one, its liable to have resilience regardless of the fact that it doesn't get a prompt group of onlookers. "

My library of books on the subject of war dwarfs that of my local library. I have visited many battlefields and have spent many hours conversing with veterans. However after seeing this film I realised I knew NOTHING of war. the sense of loss, of sadness, of destruction is overpowering. I have never cried after seeing a film. In fact I find it very difficult to cry in general. But about an hour after seeing this film I broke down and cried like never before in my life. That is true art. Saving Private Ryan has often been sited as being in the same league as this in other reviews here. I find this insulting. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved SPR, but to mention it in the same breath as this is just wrong. An event in my life recently reminded me quite strongly of Come And See. There is a beautiful forested aria not far from where I live. An aria of outstanding natural beauty. I have gone for walks there since I was a child, and continued to do so for many years. Some of my happiest memories are of the beauty and tranquillity of that forest. Then about a year ago there was a forest fire. My beautiful forest was gone. Come And See evoked the same feelings of loss and sadness but more intensely. Those were only trees -beautiful although they were- but these were real people. Although Come And See is not based on a true story per se, it is firmly grounded in history, with 628 similar instances. If this film touched you as deeply as it did me, I would recommend a trip to the Khatyn Memorial in Belarus.  "

102419,tt0050212,Admiraljames11,united states,10,The Ultimate Test of Survival-with some real life facts,"This movie is the extremely accurate rendition of the incredible heroics of the brave men in Japanese prison camps that were made to build railroads. Many of these men after surviving battle on ships, ship sinkings, environmental and weather elements, were then subjected to cruel and inhuman treatment of Japanese soldiers. This movie is an accurate portrayal of these conditions with a few exceptions: (1) They did not whistle when entering the camp(although they did march in military formation, even when captured). (2) In the movie, Cdr. Shears tells the story of how he was on the USS Houston at the time she was sunk ,and how he and a Commander was separated from everyone else and drifted to the other side of the island. The commander died and he took his rank...etc. In real life, there was a USS Houston that was sunk and there was a Commander Maer that did drift to the other side of the island with a Seaman Elam ,which is consistent with Cdr. Shears story of the Houston sinking. However, both Cdr. Maer and Seaman Elam survived and were captured.(3) Real conditions of the prison camps were far more deplorable than depicted ,as well as the work details. (Men that couldn't walk were put on stretchers and given a hammer to bust up rock etc). (4) There were more American POWS than depicted in the movie, (the British often referred to the Americans as ""Rabble""). and (5) They did not blow up the Bridge in the end and Col Nicholson certainly didn't turn on his own people to attempt to keep the bridge from blowing up. Still an awesome movie that is a must see.  "
103593,tt0083658,Admiraljames11,united states,10,A Look into the Future,"When discussing the works of Ripley Scott, it is extremely difficult at best not to use such cerebrally intimidating terms such as ""eclectic"", ""noir"", and ""dazzling technology"". As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum. In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, ""Alien"", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was ""The Duelist"" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie Alien was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie ""Blade Runner"" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"". Although it did not do well at the box office, it is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryogenic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts. In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages Right pr wrong,. there is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be made better if they purchased certain products or moved to a ""better"" location. Watching the movie leaves one with the feeling of awe. The realism of situations and special effects only serve to enhance this effect. This movie is a much watch for any fan of science fiction, or to anyone who wants to get a look into the future.  "

Ken Watanabe had a nice take on Ra's Al Ghul but the real star was Liam Neeson. His role as Ducard shows what an amazing actor he really is, and what a great mentor character he can pull off with well done dialog and directing. The only real trouble for me came from Katie Holmes. She looked very out of place and more like a lost teenager then a real district attorney. This Batman was set in a very real world, in a real looking Gotham city. The technology was believable and the use of CGI was not over blown for the first time this summer. This Batman had what so many others have been missing. A plot, a real character driven plot. Not a CGI driven effects show case. Christopher Nolan comes through in every way for this film.

Though a tall order to fill, I have to say she more than delivered when she brought American History X over. It was powerful, brutal, beautiful, and compelling; the last type of movie most of us college freshman typically see with friends on a friday night. American History X follows the story of a young, brilliant, and very charismatic leader (stunningly played by Edward Norton) of a gang of Neo-Nazis in California, as well as his younger brother's (played by Edward Furlong) involvement in the same group. I'm not going to tell you any more than that; one of the things I enjoyed most about it was that I knew nothing more than that, so the plot was truly captivating. Not that it cannot stand on it's own; far from it! To tell the truth, I had absolutely no interest in what I thought would be yet another p.c. movie hollywood decides to throw at its consumers of ""Racism is the ultimate evil""; it's one of those subjects that has been beat to death, which makes Tony Kaye's (the director) job that much more difficult. However, Mr. Kaye does so in breathtaking fashion. Much like Memento (which, of course, came after X), a great deal of the film is told via flashback in black and white. Many of the movie's most violent and compelling scenes are set to a powerfully dramatic, classical score that would simply come off as cheesy in any other film I can think of. What all this does is sober you up, grab your attention by the throat and make you seriously consider what this movie has to say. And what it has to say is both easily comprehensible, and brilliantly correct. Instead of portraying all Neo-Nazis as stupid rednecks, demonic villains or unknowing pawns, Kaye creates characters with real dimensions to them. Most people would find it hard to believe, but it isn't long after the movie starts that you actually care about two young racists, and even understand where these young men come from. Another brilliant move by Kaye and X's writer, David McKenna, was to present the logical, intelligent arguments that Neo-Nazis use, and precisely show where exactly those arguments are flawed. Unlike most movies, Kaye actually has the balls to show Ed Norton arguing with a teacher from school against integration, and shows him winning the argument! Another important element of this film is the reason it is rated R: horrific violence. What is so unfortunate is that many, many people will not see this film simply because of its graphic content, yet that is what makes it so horrifying, so gripping, and so mentally lasting. It, along with Schindler's List, is a movie that everyone should see at some point in their life; after that, you probably won't ever want to see it again.  "
100853,tt0457430,AdmNaismith,united states,3,Two incomplete films,"An extraordinary effort all for naught. The script presents us with two stories that are compelling in their own right, but when combined here are incomplete and ultimately unsatisfying. The story about the Spanish authorities tracking down guerrilla rebels is fine, although the brutal act of the Captain in charge are almost too much to be believed (his comeuppance at the hands of his maid is still a high point). The supernatural elements add nothing to this story. Ofelia's journey to regain her underworld throne has nothing to do with the activities of the Franco government, or her mother's marriage to the Captain. The ending makes both of these points more than clear. Del Toro would have served his audience better to have made two separate films from the elements he created, giving himself a chance to refine the characters and situations in each story. As it is, everything here seems arbitrary, and a bit over the top, and unconnected.  "

119562,tt2488496,AdmrlLocke,united states,9,"Not As Good as the Original Three, But Still Good","I just returned from the opening midnight showing of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. I'd say first off that the movie seems pretty typical for a J.J. Abrams movie: strong on character development and action, but weak on plot. I'd say though that perhaps the plot had a little more strength than the typical Abrams movie, while the character development and especially the action didn't quite rise to Abrams' usual standards. I found the most compelling character development to take place between Han and Leia. I also found that Abrams managed to imbue the movie with more than a sprinkling of the ironic humor that made the original three Star Wars movies so funny, easily surpassing what often seemed like forced humor in the three Star Wars prequels. The action, however, simply couldn't live up to the prequels, which featured what are still easily the two greatest live-action lightsaber duals in the Star Wars universe. I got the feeling that Abrams, who as I understand it grew up watching the original three, went out of his way to avoid his usual glaring plot holes and avoided going to the action extremes of the three prequels, to make The Force Awakens feel more like the original three. Perhaps nothing successfully evoked the feel of the original Star Wars movies better than Abrams' use of John Williams' score, both the old and the new∂?providing at appropriate points a sense of sorry and longing, a sense for foreboding, or a sense of excitement. I literally laughed and cried. The very last scene of the movie left me with a tear that ran all the way down my left cheek. The Force Awakens contained at least two major plot reveals, and set the stage for what I suspect might be an even more major plot reveal in Star Wars VIII: The Force Returns in 2017. While my favorite parts involved the original Star Wars cast members, I found Daisy Ridley a fresh, young talent as the new heroine, and John Boyega wasn't bad as Finn either. I'm not usually a big fan of 3D, but I thought Abrams made rare good use of it, like when a star destroyer suddenly appeared about to collide with my face. I'm having trouble deciding whether I like The Force Awakens any better than the three prequel movies. While I hated Jar Jar Binks, I never otherwise disliked the prequels the way that many fans did. If I had to guess about other fans, I'd say that more of them will rank The Force Awakens below the original three but above the prequel than any other ranking among fans.  "
2542,tt0111161,adnaanahsan,bangladesh,10,A movie that touches the heart...,"This is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen. The acting of the main protagonists - Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman - are brilliant. The movie is about hope and redemption. It is also about how uncertain life is - how circumstances can lead a person to disastrous consequences through no fault of his own.  Tim Robbin's portrayal of Andy Dufresne - a banker who is sent to jail for murdering his wife - was as natural as ever. Morgan Freeman as a seasoned convict Red who goes through a transformation during his time with Andy makes you feel for the man. Bob Gunton will make you hate the evil hypocritical warden with all your heart. Overall, everyone has done a beautiful job with their roles.  This film touched a special chord in my heart. I never tire of watching it. If you love the drama genre, this movie is for you. "
8629,tt0468569,adnaankapadia,united arab emirates,10,"One of a kind, Nolan's best work.","You won't have any trouble believing that aphorism when you see Heath Ledger's mesmerizing performance as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" Christopher Nolan's hotly anticipated and often brilliantly executed follow-up to ""Batman Begins."" His face caked in cracked white greasepaint, his smile a grotesque red lipstick scar, kohl rimming his eyes, the Joker is a cruel kind of clown, the kind that is only interested in the last laugh. Slouched in his purple suit, Ledger gives him a lopsided shuffle, a permanently craning neck and an insinuating, deceptively neighborly voice. But there's something reptilian about the way his tongue flicks through his pursed lips like a pickpocket. He's hungry for trouble, a maniac for mayhem -- and in Gotham City, where crime is still running wild, he can make himself right at home. Ledger dominates this movie as a living presence, a live wire, dangerous and unpredictable. It's an astonishing performance, as extravagant and free (""deranged"" might be a better word) as his Ennis Del Mar in ""Brokeback Mountain"" was inhibited and tongue-tied. And ""The Dark Knight"" takes him -- and its world -- very seriously. Even more than Batman himself, the Joker would usually scream ""camp"" (and has in the TV series and other movies) but Nolan refuses to go there. His Gotham is cement and glass, a ""real"" city not so different from what we might find in any contemporary action thriller. (Chicago doubles for Batman's metropolis.) "
142611,tt1201607,Adnan Altaf,pakistan,10,A mesmerizing and spell binding conclusion to the greatest phenomenon of this decade.,"A phenomenon which started 14 years ago ends with the last chapter in the Harry Potter Saga. The movie series, unlike the books, had its share of ups and downs. As a die hard Potterhead, I've always preferred the first two movies which remain the most faithful to the books. I really hated how this series had to face a change of directors in the middle, disrupting a continuous flow from the first two, but even though the third and the fourth ones had their differences from the book, yet they remained entertaining and magical. It wasn't until David Yates came that in my opinion that the series went downhill. With Yates helming the fifth and the sixth one, the Harry Potter movie saga was at its worst. Not only were those two dull and bland, Yates completely missed the essence of the books which the other directors were able to hold on to. When I came to know that David Yates was chosen for the finale, my worst fear had come true. I dreaded how Yates was going to butcher the finale of a great series which deserved a perfect send off. With the release of Deathly Hallows - Part 1, I was both concerned and relieved. Part 1 had its share of great moments but just like the previous two installments, something was missing, something magical which the first four in the series had. So from then onwards it was time to await for the finale and wonder if Part 2 would be what us fans expected it to be. Today, after watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 for the second time I can only say this, Harry Potter fans could not have asked for a better end to the series that has shaped their childhood for more than a decade. Everything about the movie was perfect. From the acting, which was the greatest amongst all the eight movies, especially from Daniel Radcliffe who had the whole movie on his shoulder to carry on and carries it off, he does brilliantly, from Ralph Fiennes who portrays a great villain with perfect menace and from Alan Rickman as Snape who gives us the highlight sequence of the series with such sincerity and grace that would make even a casual fan feel for him. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson though this time had to be sidelined a bit but still play their part beautifully with Emma showing why she's one of the brilliant actresses out there and Rupert who this time around brings out a more truer Ron than he had in the previous few installments. Not to mention the other actors like Maggie Smith who this time was given a deserving screen time and a role to play, Matthew Lewis who gives a terrific performance as the unsung Hero of Hogwarts and all the rest. If there was one thing Harry Potter got absolutely correct then that was the casting. Kudos to the filmmakers to achieve such a success with this! The direction this time around was outstanding. Always considered David Yates to be the worst thing that happened to Hogwarts but he has proved me wrong with a finale that puts him up there with the elite ones. Even though he butchered two installments but he created an outstanding finale which is his redemption. The music is one of the reasons why the movie works so well. Alexandre Desplat may have given a better than average music for Part 1 but with Part 2 he shows why he is an Oscar nominated composer. His battle tracks especially the Statues and Courtyard Apocalypse were brilliant and his Lilly and Severus along with the Resurrection Stone track hits all the right notes. Though his biggest contribution is the use of John William's Leaving Hogwarts for the epilogue which is the greatest service he could have given to the fans and works as a powerful tool to bring out a decade long emotion in the end. The visual effects as usual with the HP series were brilliant. The Battle of Hogwarts was breath taking, with beautiful cinematography. This movie had the right amount of violence and action keeping the battle intriguing and intense. A mesmerizing and spell binding conclusion to the greatest phenomenon of this decade. David Yates, by crafting a magical finale, you have truly demonstrated why Harry Potter is and will always be.... The Boy Who Lived...!!!  "

148940,tt0401792,adnankujundzic,united states,6,"Great on so many levels, yet if falls short","I am a huge fan of Miller's comics and really dislike Rodriguez's films. The hype surrounding this movie was huge and as of today the movie is in IMDb top 100. But at the same time, so are Kill Bill and Kill Bill 2, two movies that I disliked with passion. So I didn't really know what to expect from Sin City. Unfortunately I walked out of Sin City with mixed reviews. First the good The attention to detail that went to transferring the comic book into movie is amazing. Backgrounds look exactly the same as they do in the comics, and to give the movie another dimension, many features, such as rain and scenes that show characters all white against black background, have comic book look to it. This movie take the technology introduced in Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow to a whole new level. Mickey Rourke is amazing as tough-as-nail Marv. Perfectly cast, perfectly played out part. Elijah Wood creates perfect Kevin. I get the chills while reading the comic every time Kevin shows up. Movie is no different. Devon Aoki and Rosario Dawson do excellent job as well. The bad So many actors are not suited for their roles. Bruce Willis does not suit almost 70 year old Hartigan. Clive Owen, Benicio Del Toro, Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Joshua Hartnett all are playing parts not suited for them. The inner monologue that each character work brilliantly in the comic, but for some reason looks ridiculous in the movie. Each character thinks as if they are all read Wall Street Journal and watch private eye flicks from 40's. Sometimes the end result is simply laughable. The scene when Clive Owen is being pulled out from the lake by Devon Aoki is a perfect example of that. Finally, when characters do talk, it is always as if the words are being forced out of them, always ending with a big sigh. Overall, I don't think the movie deserves to be in the top 250 of all time, let alone top 100. It is solid, but not great, and definitely not deserving all the hype it got so far.  "

62636,tt1853728,adog1990,united states,10,"Quentin Tarantino's best next to Pulp Fiction and a good tribute to not only western films, but the directors who mentor Quentin.","This movie to me is one of the best movies of 2012 and Quentin Tarantino's best movie that is great as his other masterpiece Pulp Fiction. The story is about a slave Jango (the ""D"" is silent) played by Jamie Foxx rescued by a bounty hunter (played by Quentin Tarantino's lucky acting cram Christoph Waltz in another best acting role of his). They soon become partners in the bounty hunting bushiness and plan to rescue Django's wife held as a slave by the villainous Leonardo DiCaprio (in a great role of his career) and the evil and sneaky Samuel L. Jackson (who turns out is the real brains behind this slave ring). The action is great and pretty funny like most Quentin's films and it is not only a great tribute to Spaghetti Westerns by Quentin, but to me a great tribute to the two directors who help Mr. Tarantino make his first movie Tony Scott and Ulu Grosbard who died on the year of this film's release before it came out. I notice the tributes to them in this film more than other people did. For Ulu Grosbard, Quentin pay tributes to his films such as True Confessions (the partnership with Dr. King Schultz and Django), Falling in Love (Django and his wife's romance), The Deep End of the Ocean (Broomhilda surprised to have finally meet Django again) and Who Is Harry Kellerman and Why Is He Saying Those Terrible Things About Me? (in scenes including Jamie Foxx in a snow hill scene in the same way as Dustin Hoffman in the movie). For Tony Scott, it was mostly the action scenes (especially the big battle in Candy Land) are tributes to his films True Romance, Enemy of the State, The Last Boy Scout and Domino. What should of make the film better is that the credits should of have ""Dedicated to Ulu and Tony"" the same as Clint Eastwood dedicated Unforgiven to Sergio Leone and Don Siegel. But along with ""In Memory of Sally Menke and J. Michael Riva"". That was the only thing that I criticize the movie about is Quentin should of dedicated his movie to Tony Scott, Ulu Grosbard, Sally Menke and J. Michael Riva who died before the film was release. Over all, this is still a great movie and very good tributes to Western and Tony Scott and Ulu Grosbard. I say its worth checking out, if you love colorful funny bloody action and Quentin films you will love it. Its funny, action packed, original and has good acting and action.  "

The acting from the main character is amazing, as well as Michael Fassbender who plays a crazy religious drunk slave owner and is become one of the best actors of the 21st century. The direction by Steve McQueen is gold and the best I have seen since Steven Spilberge for Saving Pravite Ryan and again Schindler's List and Tom Hooper for The King's Speech. The other stuff that I like was the music score by Hans Zimmer while although it feels the same as he did Inception, it is haunting and powerful as his scores to The Thin Red Line and Galdiator.

So, the film finally starts, we lay back with high hopes as the movie trailers go through, and, finally, Django is on. I can honestly say that i was expecting a little bit of professional directing from Quentin, as the first scenes of the film were not shot as professionally as they should be. But, nevertheless, its Quentin Tarantino, so i respect the way he wanted it to be. Watching it, i have to say that the film was an n-word warfare, while raining blood and guts..

Another problem i had was the way everyone treated Forrest calling him dumb and idiot like every 30 minutes this film as a whole is very hard to watch to be honest just for the way everyone doubted him even those girls when they called him stupid and Dan Taylor pushed her away and he fall over his wheelchair and those chicks made fun of him it was painful. But besides that this film is truly a cinematic treasure with Tom Hanks giving one of the finest performances of his entire life and also inspiring people and even meeting famous presidents or singers like Elvis and John Lennon (they did a pretty good job with those scenes by the way) or even the promise he gave to his dear friend Bubba Blue and it's so sad seeing a very young Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Junior he was very talented but once again Hollywood ruined another young kid. As for my favorite moment in the entire film it has to be when Forrest find out about his son and the first thing he asks is if he is smart that scene destroyed me completely. Forrest Gump deserves all the praise it gets but like i said characters like Jenny should and could be handled much much better.  "

Most of the time sequels suck but not this one this easily a step up than the first film which was also fantastic but this one did somethings better for example the scenes with the trees in the forest or the battle sequences and smigol continues to steal the show Andy Serkis is a fantastic actor and he can play any character that you want also the cgi on Smigol is fantastic he looks very real and you feel like he is going to talk to you so that's another great thing about those movies.

GoodFellas is one of those movies that you see and think what the hell happened to Robert De Niro and Ray Liotta why do they make crappy movies this days? The thing is all about money but back then art was real for example Joe Pesci in this film alongside Liotta and De Niro are excellent great actors and characters with a lot of power and charisma even Samuel L. Jackson has a small role before he gets wasted. A lot of violence, corruption, bloodbath and men with a lot of power and money unfortunately tho this movie is not better than the amazing Casino also directed by Scorsese or even The Godfather Trilogy but still a really good directed movie with really good acting and a very interesting story and that's why i'll give it a 8.5/10.

A New Hope is the film that started the magic of the Saga even tho is not as great as the sequel that came after it Episode IV is definitely awesome from the beautiful cast to the good writing and direction. Too bad that George Lucas had to change some of the most awesome scenes in a cut that has way too much CGI and for the record Han Shot First. At the end Star Wars: A New Hope is a great film that created one of the most beautiful Franchises of all time.

The jokes that the characters try to throw in some of the scenes are just awful and for sure not funny Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman can't save the film that David Fincher (Alien3) directed the cast is good the acting is meh except Spacey and the ending is a huge WTF that shows that the Bad guys can truly win other than that Se7en is a 2 hour film that is boring to the bone if you want to see a great serial killer film go watch Zodiac that is one hell of a film.

Silence of the Lambs is a film that i have a very tough time to enjoy and in a scale of 1 to 10 it's definitely an 8 i just wish that the film had a more interesting villain than Buffalo Bill and don't get me wrong Ted Levine did a nice job with his character it's just that moments like that scene where he dances butt naked and acts like a woman were stupid as hell and that girl Catherine was annoying as hell she never stopped screaming. Anthony Hopkins gives an amazing performance in the film and there's a scene in particular which i loved it's the scene where he is in the ambulance and we find out that he actually stole the face of the guard in order to escape that was a very clever scene there's also a scene where he basically crucified the other guard and his scenes with Jodie Foster who was also very good in the film too were magnificent. Guys in the end Silence of the Lambs is a really good film with 2 great leading performances, a weak villain who is overrated and almost ruins the whole movie but also a victim that gets annoying after a while i'm going to give the film an 8/10.

The cast is truly great especially Spacey and Byrne and Bryan Singer directs a movie very well shot and directed and i wasn't disappointed not even for a second and i would definitely watch this again without a doubt.

Definitely a movie that you need to check if you haven't seen it from the Golden Era of the 80's and definitely on the list with Steven Spielberg's best movies.

But even without his direction those films still remain great and awesome. Anyways T2 is a great sequel and for sure it's not Overrated but the way it was directed it just made every sequel impossible because it has a perfect direction.

My only problem with the film was the 3rd act and the ending where everyone started killing each other you know all 3 main actors from the poster died especially DiCaprio's death was like ""What The?"" but i liked the way Damon was killed that was really nice to see but still great Crime movie.

As much as i loved New Hope i think Return of the Jedi was better just for those minutes alone because he truly showed a beautiful side of Anakin Skywalker something that the prequels didn't. Star Wars VI isn't getting enough credit for me and that is pretty bad i think all 3 films are awesome on their own way although this one has the most humor in it and i think those little creatures were pretty cool and cute and definitely not as annoying as some people said we can always have Jar Jar Binks for that.

That ""It's not your fault"" scene brought tears to my eyes and the ending was there to show you how real friends look like they smiled not because he left but because he left to do something better with his life instead of actually working for 20 years at the same place.

The first time i saw this film i was blown away great performances by 2 giants of Cinema, great action, suspense and the screen time that Pacino and De Niro share together is like 5 minutes and it's so great especially the ending is just amazing in every way and that goes to Michael Mann he brought this 2 great actors and the result was truly epic and it's so sad that their next movie was going to be a bomb i'm talking about the 2008 Righteous KilL starring Pacino and De Niro again together and the result was just not that great.

If you haven't seen Inside Out please do it's touching, funny and has great funny characters that will totally win you over trust me it's just a magic film.  "

Room is one of those movies that i almost hated it the first 20 or maybe 25 minutes or so bored me to death and seeing a boy with long hair looking like a girl truly made me laugh but as the film goes on i found out that it's actually pretty great seeing this mother played by Brie Larson doing everything in her power to save her kid Jack played by Jacob Tremblay was really inspiring in a way and if you erase those 20-25 minutes the film is really great the performances by the 2 leads are really great and it's a powerful story as well but also the characters are well written and interesting and that's why i'm going to give the Room an 8/10.

But the good thing about this film is that it's so ahead of it's time and so awesome when it comes to practical effects and locations todays movies can't even reach greatness like this and also it tries to spread some messages like the meaning of life not Ford's all time best but for sure it's inside my list next to The Star Wars Trilogy and Episode 7, Indiana Jones and The Fugitive.

Thanks to great characters and an amazing direction by Scorsese Casino it's just full of epicness that i can't even explain this movie is just a diamond of cinematic gold and i can also see from where American Hustle was inspired.

The Wolf of Wall Street is a film that i had a very hard time to connect with the first time i saw it i basically skipped every scene and reached the ending and in other words i hated it but since Margot Robbie was in this and i recently saw Casino and i own it on DVD and i thought that it was amazing i said why the hell not? And i shut down and spend 3 hours of my life and i realised how wrong i was because this movie is a masterpiece with some flaws sure but masterpiece every time that Scorsese and DiCaprio work together is just amazing and if you don't believe me go watch The Departed or Gangs of New York this man can make any actor shine in a movie any day of the week for example Jonah Hill in this film is awesome and he is not one of my favorite actors like ever and yet he gave a great performance also DiCaprio who shines as always and Margot Robbie is truly great too and we have to thank Scorsese cause he brought an angel to our hearts so thank you Mr. Scorsese. Everyone in this movie is just amazing and it's truly one of those movies that this director made and it's different from others although he does take a few things from previous films of his now as for flaws there's way too many sex scenes in this film but i really didn't hated that because even movies such as The Terminator had sex scenes in it so screw it, there's also way too much cocaine too but still give me a break Scarface had too and that's one of Pacino's best movies ever there's even a scene with gay orgy and one that Hill eats a live fish and although they bothered me a bit i won't down grade the film. What i'm trying to say is that this film surprised there's a lot of great performances, money, fame and corruption and shows the big life as it should be and honestly i feel that this film was even better than Goodfellas and as good as The Departed and Casino and all those 3 films i mentioned were amazing in every way. I hope that Scorsese and DiCaprio work again together because they understand each other so much.  "

Jeff Bridges gives a really good performance no doubt about that but John Goodman is the one who steals the show both in this film and 10 Cloverfield Lane the man is an amazing actor and Hollywood needs to cast him in much better films that scene when he basically became Mike Tyson against Peter Stormare and every time he said ""Shut the F*ck up Donny"" it was just funny the man is funny and so was Bridges we go threw a trip with him drinking and wearing all this weird clothes and the only thing he asks it's his freaking rug back that's all i was even surprised that a young Tara Reid was in this film i mean doesn't she star in Sharknado 20 by now?

The things that Marlin has been threw alongside Dory is just amazing Sharks, Whales, Turtles and anything else that you can think of both Friends & Enemies but it's also a film that brings you the feels and if they weren't those actors to portray this roles the film would have never become a thing on the first place soon i will review Finding Dory stay tuned.

First of all i read some of the reviews here and most people said that this is a remake and not a sequel yes it has some scenes that reminded me of Episode IV but it's totally a different story it pays more homage and has a lot of references if there is a film that was basically a remake this year it was Jurassic World. The new characters Finn and Rey are great and pretty lovable also this one is the funniest of all the Star Wars movies and the humor was pretty well done. There are 3 with 4 scenes that you will definitely shed a tear and as for the villain i do agree that he needed to be more stronger and more deadlier but i think Kylo Ren was OK but Darth Vader still remains the best villain in the franchise for me. The Force Awakens is action packed, funny and also sad and it's definitely 50 times better than Episode I, II & III. Watching Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke on the big screen was enough for me.  "

This film talks about important things child abuse and how the church isn't that innocent and in my mind it did pretty good and it's also nice to see Keaton in big movies again that go well in both critics and audience if you like this kind of films Spotlight is the movie for you if not you can always watch big loud films like Mad Max: Fury Road.

The cast is fantastic and talented some of them are and other's not so much but the over the top acting and moments can't save an unfunny mess of a movie that this was.

Jurassic Park is not just an experience it's a breath taking classic with character development at it's finest it's well acted, well directed, well shot and has some of the best Practical Effects and CGI that you will ever see and only Terminator 2 can reach at this point. The relationship between the kids and Grant was so wonderful to look at it basically starts as 2 annoying kids bothering him and ends up being a great friendship since the man saved them in multiple occasions, but also that great dinner scene with Ellie and Hammond was just so great to look at Richard Attenborough face changing in a single flash when he understands that his dream is gone and what truly matters is to bring his grand children back safe. The cgi and practical effects on the Dinosaurs are easy to be located not in a bad way tho cause Spielberg knows how to mix the fun, the drama but also the action besides he is the man who made everyone afraid of the water with Jaws years back before Jurassic Park. The original film for me is definitely the best it's just so beautiful and it has all those characters that i love but i want to give another shot to the sequels as well i might review The Lost World and Jurassic Park III in the near future just to finish it although i want to see Jurassic World again too just to analyse it better. The problem with the sequels wasn't that they were bad regardless what anyone is saying is that they went way too over the top a dinosaur in a City or even a Super New Dinosaur that can communicate with other's of it's kind. Anyways to wrap this up i love the first one cause it was something that truly made more sense with people who were so naive and wanted to become 'gods' and ended up bringing back something Terrifying also that theme song is still so amazing that brings chills threw my spine. Jurassic Park of course gets an A+ and a 10 out of 10.  "

Are you telling me that you didn't cry in this movie?

The only problem i found with Zootopia is that it was kinda humorless i mean i chuckled twice but that's it but i think they wanted to focus more on the characters instead of the laughs and with characters like Judy and Nick Disney proves why they are just so awesome and why they make great movies. The way the movie ends also shows a 2nd part is coming so i hope they do it this is an animated movie that both kids & their parents will enjoy it's smart, it has action and even tho there isn't this big Disney humor the film works thanks to it's characters alone. 10/10  "

Both an Origins and a Sequel to the previous 2 movies of the series this Bourne film is easily the best one after the 1st film it has great chase sequences and an eye popping jump roof to roof scene that everyone knows by hard. What i like about this 3 movies is not only that Matt Damon is a badass but also it's a great Spy Trilogy with action and suspense that we all loved probably the most badass Movie Trilogy ever made that nobody will ever hate.

If i have to pick 2 of my favorite scenes from this film is definitely that bear scene which it looked so real every time that he gets attacked and that scene with the horse which i don't want to ruin i can't remember any other Dicaprio movie that he gave his best or even with so much gore. If Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't get this Oscar for this movie then he will never get one. The rest of the cast wasn't really that great in my opinion especially Tom Hardy who just plays Bane without a mask.

I loved the cast and everyone did an amazing job and i hate to say this but Colossus was the biggest surprise of the movie i loved his accent and even tho he was cgi he was amazing portrayed and he had moments to shine also the opening and end credits were epic and i loved the references to X-Men Origins Wolverine (especially the figure cameo) and Alien 3 and Godfather and a bunch of other films good and bad. If this isn't the best Marvel movie of all time it's definitely on my top 10 list. Ryan Reynolds steals the show and he is so freaking funny even tho i wasn't a big Deadpool fan i kinda feel that i am right now and i know that people will hate me for saying this but i loved both versions of the character the old one and the new one although this one is the superior version my favorite scenes is definitely the ones where he fought Francis Twice and the whole highway scene also this movie had the best use of cgi i've ever seen better than most recent Marvel movies and DC movies. Deadpool is definitely a great movie that you need to see sure it's not for everyone but R-Rated films were never so freaking cool this movie deserves praise instead of the 2015 Mad Max: Fury Road and if it can win an Oscar i would definitely be happy for the effects at least. Can't wait for Deadpool 2 also that Stan Lee cameo was priceless. My final rating is a 10 out of 10 loved it!!!!

63492,tt0081505,adorabillie,united kingdom,10,Favourite Horror Film,"Absolutely brilliant. The great thing about this film is that the film's 'villain' is not a supernatural being, it is the main character himself. Out of all of Stephen King's novels, this is my favourite, and also one of my favourite films in general. The only thing that irritates me is the actress who plays Jack's wife: she seems too passive, even for that character...but that small flaw in an otherwise brilliant film is insignificant. I love the voice the boy puts on for 'Tony' as well, it's super creepy (and I'm not usually a fan of the now-clich«∏ 'psychic kids in horrors). Everything is perfect, and it also is parodied in the greatest Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror episode of all time, 'The Shinning'. Also, the ending is awesome, but I won't say too much about that.  "
52968,tt0088763,adorabley,South Korea,7,"My Favorite, Back To The Future","My favorite movie is ""Back To The Future"" which is made by Robert Zemeckis. The main point of the movie is time exploration using time-machine. It was memorable from beginning to end. I think the moment that Marty tries to make the link was moving. Because the link could holds two people together. At that moment I thought what would happen to them if Marty does not make his parents meet? I cannot imagine. It is not really predictable. I want to watch other sequels if I have free time. Therefore, I want to recommend that you watch the movie, Back To The Future.  "
5098,tt0068646,ADOZER200,united states,10,This is an offer you cant refuse!," I loved this movie. I always used to think it was over-hyped but i finally watched the entire movie in whole not too long ago and i totally see why everyone has been raving about it for years. I also watched other mafia movies such as Scarface, Goodfellas, and Casino and none of them even compared to the great godfather. I honestly cannot say who does better in this movie Brando's character is one for the ages, Pacino is so convincing it gives me chills, Cahn's character is played so well you cant even explain why you like the guy so much, and Duvall is magnificent as the cool under fire lawyer. If you haven't seen it then you are missing out...i know i was.  "
15199,tt0167260,ADOZER200,united states,10,First was better," This was all around a great film. The graphics were beautiful and the acting superb. I just feel that there was something missing. I guess something didnt meet up to my expectations, but the extended version promises much more deleted scenes. Hopefully that will fullfill my needs. The second film i felt the same way so hopefully they will have more in the extended version. Above all I thought the movei was awesome and I have to give Sean Astin credit for doing what I think was the best out of all the actors. I loved his performance in the movie and hopefully hollywood will realize who the real actors are in stead of these crappy actors like colin farrel or ben affleck. I recommend this film to anyone who is into fantasy adventure type movies.  "
18964,tt0120737,ADOZER200,united states,10,A great modern classic," This move definitely is a classic of today. The directing was pure excellence and the special effects are outstanding. I havent seen a movie made this well since the late eighties sometime. I was always thinking that it was about time for them to come out with a fantasy movie. Im not a big fan of the lord of the rings but after seeing this i have to get into it more. The characters were awesome. Whenever every single one of the characters do good then youve got a classic and thats in any movie. They couldnt have chosen a better actor than Elijah Wood to play Frodo. He has the sadness in his eyes and the humble like features that i felt Frodo should have. Ian McKellan did great as Magneto in XMEN but he excelled that part as Gandolf. His true colors came out at the end as showed his true courage against the shadowy fire beast. Sean Astin of course did a good job as always. John Rhyeis Davies did wonderful as the Dwarf. I didnt even recognize him at first. Strider was a very well liked character, id like to see more of him in the sequels and Orlando Bloom played an unforgettable role as an elf. It proves to all of us the cool and determination(and great skill)elves have in battle. Even when the goblins attacked at close range you could see the concentration in his eyes to destroy the creatures. I just have to say this movie was a 10 all the way because of everyones effort they put into it. This is definitely the new trilogy of the century for all of us to enjoy!!!!!!!!!  "
19064,tt0120737,ADOZER200,united states,10,Be a part of the fellowship!," I have to say when i first saw this movie i liked it but i didnt love it, or at least not yet. I read more about this story and learned about the facts and characters and i have to say i want to see this movie everyday now. It is a classic for our time. This is what working so hard on a film is worth. This can be put amongst the greatest movie of all time and not just in my opinion. I would have to say it is better than Harry Potter or any of the new Star Wars movies. Thats hard for me to say being such a big fan of Star Wars. Ofcourse there are some classics it could never beat like the original Star Wars for example. This definitely is a hard earned film. Props to Peter Jackson for his directing. Ian Mckellan as Gandolf was awesome. I could not think of anyone better for the job. I thought about Christopher Lee but he played well enough as Saramon. Elijah Wood and Sean Astin have been two of my favorite actors for years and to see both of them together in one film was good enough for me. When i found out John Rhys Davies played Gimli i flipped out. He is always doing a great job like in Indiana Jones and King Solomons Mines. Im gla to see he is still doing well and actually better than ever. Now Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Sean Bean im not too familiar with. Bean plays Borimir who is courageous and some what good hearted but coneyving at the same time. I couldnt think of anyone better for that part. Mortensen plays Aragorn(Strider). I think he was an awesome actor in this. Aragorn's performance grows more on me every time i see the movie. My favorite of the whole film was Bloom playing the character Legoles. The old myth of the elf comes to life through this character. I have always studied the myth of the elves and they got it pretty accurate. Featherweight, great senses, ears of a dolphin, nose of a hound, eye of a hawk, eats like a bird, strategic moves, skill with a bow, very feirce and crafty with the blade when they have to be. Above all this movie is amongst my favorites and i cant wait until the whole trilogy comes out.  "
22765,tt0080684,ADOZER200,united states,10,one of the only very worthy sequels," This is a great sequel. This movie could actually be proven to be better than its original but then again there is no movie more original than star wars plus it made more money in theaters than the sequels but this movie is definitely worth watching and to anyone who hasnt seen it ""youre missing out"". This movies contains the best scene in the series which includes the part with the AT-AT walkers. The planet Hoth would never again be visited. Hopefully in the prequels to be we will see more of this but above all this is a great movie everyone should enjoy.  "
27299,tt0167261,ADOZER200,united states,10,Great battle sequences!!!!!!!, This is by far a very worthy sequel. I saw it as soon as i could. In a way it is better than the original but the original was so great its hard for me to say that. The fighting scenes are awesome. Ive never seen a battle so epic like the final one. Supposedly the battle for middle earth is supposed to be even greater. I cant wait until the last one. Peter Jackson is making a fortune off of these movies. Supposedly he doesnt want to make anymore but you really think i believe that. With all that money id make fifty more. It could be like Star Wars with a prequel. The Hobbit would be the perfect set up. I really believe that in the near future that this book will come to life. The Samarillion is another story. Im not too familiar with this one but i believe it has something to do with Lord of the Rings. That would be a good story to bring to life as well. I would hate to see Lord of the Rings just end. Im sure because of how great the new movie did that Peter Jackson will not pass up on doing the Hobbit even though he says he wont. I always said talk is cheap. Bring on the Hobbit!  
39998,tt0120815,ADOZER200,united states,10,The greatest war movie ever made," This was one heck of a war movie! I enjoyed every second of it. Tom Hanks does a tremendous performance as always. All the characters played a key role in the movie. One of Vin Diesals first movies too. This movie he could actually act in though. Barry Pepper plays the sniper who does well enough to pull off the job but doesnt quite fit the role to convince me enough but i really liked him in this movie. Giovani Ribisi i feel does the best as the medic. Ribisi needs more exposure and he could win an Oscar one day. I cant find a movie which tops this one off. Enemy at the Gates, Black Hawk Down, Thin Red Line, and even Full Metal Jacket just didnt quite capture my eye enough to convince me of the reality of war.   "
46921,tt0082971,ADOZER200,united states,10,This defines adventure, This movie is awesome and they will never come out with another one like it. The beginning of this movie is the best of the trilogy. The whole movie is excellent. Even though i think this one isnt as good as the other two i still rate this one very high. I choose Last Crusade over this one because the storyline was better and more creative and Temple of Doom was creepy yet somewhat realistic. This one will not be forgotten though and i highly recommend this one to everyone of all ages. I cant wait until Indiana Jones 4 comes out. I just hope they stick original stuff instead of using too much computer animation like alot of big movie nowadays.  
52725,tt0088763,ADOZER200,united states,10,Original Classic, This movie deserves to be amongst the classics. Michael J. Fox did outstanding and who could ever forget Christopher Lloyd in his role as Doc. He made me think that there actually was a real Doc. Both actors are excellent along with Crispin Glover playing George McFly. Glover does very well in his roles. I would like to see him in better movies. I chose the sequel over the original though. The reason being that the sequel involved new stuff and a bit of the original stuff. This movie should not be forgotten. There wont be one like it. Im surprised the delorium wasnt sold out at the time. were they that badly made?  
74013,tt0086190,ADOZER200,Azerbaijan,10,what a way to end a great trilogy!," This was an absolute great ending to any movie. Many people put it down for not being so great but lets think about this, it had the final battle between Skywalker and Vader, the rebels destroyed the death star,and we visited new places such as Jabas palace and the moon endor and they included many new characters like Jaba, the ewoks, and Emperor Palpatine. Now what more could you ask for in a movie. It was a great and sometime underrated ending to a great trilogy. Not to mention it made more money then Empire Strikes Back. Lets just say its well worth watching over and over again.  "
78660,tt0066921,ADOZER200,Azerbaijan,8,Strange/Satisfying Movie," Personally this goes without say, the title of the movie is as strange as the movie itself. It was hard for me to firgure out this movie. I enjoyed parts of it but then other parts were somewhat disturbing and confusing. Malcolm McDowell was awesome in the movie. The rest of the actors dont really shine. McDowell does a very convincing job by playing a scumbag of society. I dont think anything is as good as the moral of the whole movie. In fact the moral of the movie is what really makes the movie other than the master art of Kubrick. Dialogue is good as of any of Kubrick's movie but can be somewhat lenghty on some scenes. I would have to say this is one of the strangest movies ive ever seen but it did somewhat make sense to me. I gave it an 8 for cinematography, lighting, dialogue, very original story line, and great role played by McDowell. I cant say i recommend this movie to any movie lover. You have to really understand the deep meaning in this film. Basically if you look at it one dimensionally its saying what goes around comes around.  "
83558,tt0093058,ADOZER200,Azerbaijan,8,Kubrick masterpeice!, I got one thing to say...Kubrick!...If you are a big fan of cinematography and the art of a movie than any Kubrick movie will do but this one i one of his better ones next to Shining and Eyes Wide Shut. This is by far the most real war movie you will ever watch next to Saving Private Ryan. The training camp beginning is an excellent way to start out a movie. It has its unexpected twists but it is one great movei that you should not miss. Vincent D'Onofrio does another well performance. Baldwin and Modine also are excellent in the film. Amongst most of the war films this one should be one of your favorites.  
85658,tt0114709,ADOZER200,Azerbaijan,10,What a classic, Ive always wondered if my toys came to life when i was a little boy. I guess they do! This movie was awesome. It was really funny but the creativeness of the movie steals the part. Somebody came up with a good story. Very Imaginative. The best part is that it has a worthy sequel that i believe is better but they rate the same because they are both great. It brings back the child in me and i sometime wish i was a child again in this case. This one is great for all ages.  
90648,tt0097576,ADOZER200,united states,10,The ultimate adventure!!!!!!," This movie is an instant recommendation to anyone of all ages. Even though I love the whole trilogy I would have to choose this one as the best and many people I know agree with me. The beginning and the ending to the whole trilogy is the best but the ending to this one had the most creative and well thought out plan. Excellent action in this movie too, it doesn't stop for Harrison Ford. This movie has everything you would want any adventure movie to have in it...you name it. This is within my top ten movies of all time.   "

151360,tt0325980,ADOZER200,united states,8,Remarkable!," When i went to go see this movie i was excited to see my favorite ride at disneyland come to life. The movie itself was excellent. Johnny Depp stole the whole show as Captain Jack Sparro. Bloom is an up and coming actor people should watch. Kera Knightly is absolutely gorgeous. When she first came out i forgot where i was for a second there. Rush also did a tremendous job as Barbosa. Above all i think this film was great and i definitely recommend it to everyone. The only thing they should have added was a couple more memorable scenes from the ride, but other than that it was awesome!  "

Going by the reviews I too ventured to the movie with the whole family. In return what we go was crude jokes, tasteless scenes, senseless situations. The climax aptly summarizes the misery. At the end we realized that they almost re-made Munna Bhai MBBS all over again. This time around they just replaced Doctors with Engineers, Medical college with Engg College & Munna Bhai with Rancho. However at least the former was a clean comedy. If you are still curious about the movie, leave your kids behind & go watch at your own risk  "
128016,tt0395169,Adpag,united kingdom,5,So-so,"It seems that the more shocking and tragic the events that a film is based on, the easier it is to go completely gaga and convince yourself that the film is good. This film isn't bad. The events it portrays truly are a black mark in the history books, and it does well in not sensationalising what happened. On the minus side though, I thought it did seem to gloss over the whole thing. There just did not seem to be any sense of outrage. To get the point across there should have been more on-screen atrocity - not with a view to satisfying gore hounds, but to emphasise why the world should be ashamed of what happened. Consequently there was virtually no dramatic impact in it for me. As I said, it wasn't bad - neither was it particularly good. The script and acting were acceptable, but I wouldn't give it any more praise than that.  "
1435,tt0111161,AD-Phoenix,united kingdom,10,Truly heart-warming and inspirational.,"What more can you ask for? A spectacular cast, a gripping score and a strong plot all contribute this film's massive success. Easily Frank Darabont's greatest achievement, The Shawshank Redemption creates so much atmosphere, and forces you to feel a whole spectrum of emotions not explored in most films. Although sometimes exaggerated (as to be expected from a Stephen King source), the film deals without a lot of serious themes from the outset. The eventual revelation of Andy's wrongful conviction is a great turning point in the story, and gives us even more of a reason to root for our protagonist. Overall, the direction and acting are masterful, with such power put into Thomas Newman's score to send shivers through your body, there's not much else to expect from this movie: A triumph! "
21802,tt0120737,adpolicefiles,united states,6,Why do people like this so much?,"The entire Lord of the Rings series is extremely one dimensional and only a few times, two dimensional. All the visuals and creation of a whole new world on the screen merely provides a facade at which a viewer can only stare for a limited time. One simply cannot spread that over 3 whole movies. Imagine the madness of watching this in a marathon? I don't see anything new at all in this series. Monsters, Wizards, Trolls, Magic, Wars, medieval themes et al have all been done before, simply not on the same scale as done in Lord of the Rings. The story is the weakest part of the series. It builds up and is based on what is portrayed as a super villain character but the same person is never really shown throughout the entire series. It seems that the massive efforts of the heroes seem really pointless since you don't get an exact idea of what their actual motivation is? This series cannot be put in the league of Star wars. I think its safe to assume that most fans of this series are less than 15 years of age.  "

Trouble is, to be really good Sci-Fi, it has to be original...something to make you think. It should make you wonder, ""Could this happen?"" The Matrix is such a movie. All too often these days, directors rely on dazzling special effects to carry a plot with no interest to anyone. Well, this movie has all the dazzle, as well as sizzling performances by all the cast. But the highlight to me was the plot...slowly pulling you in, detail by detail, until you are totally consumed. Pure entertainment! If your a real Sci-Fi fan, you'll love ""The Matrix"".

24511,tt1375666,adrean-819-339098,australia,5,Who dreamed this fodder?,"For a film that deals in the world of dreams this film lacks a lot of imagination. I think that in being a Hollywood blockbuster it had to tick a certain amount of boxes that are necessary for the monumental amounts of money that are thrown at it. The first 30 minutes I was interested by the concept and the pacing of the film. The concept of espionage within a dream is an interesting enough concept. I was very open and excited by the idea of going into the world of dreams with the characters. I wish they could have perhaps explored a little more and pushed the boundaries of the dreams. It seemed that time and space flowed a little too seamlessly. Perhaps Kafka's 'The Trial' or a more Cronenberg style would have helped. After the first 30 minutes it sunk into the normal plodding of a Hollywood blockbuster. Are we watching Mission Impossible or a film about dreams? Unfortunately the last two thirds of the film were more Mission Impossible. I couldn't help thinking of the could have beens. All I remember is a van falling for two hours, some irrelevant action scenes in the tundra, and an in-durable no gravity scene which had me yawning. Oh and am I the only one who cannot stand Marion Coutillard?  "
14953,tt0167260,AdrenalinDragon,united kingdom,8,"I liked this film all the way through, apart from the ending","I liked all of the Lord Of The Rings films, but this one has to have the best battle scenes in it though and the most stunning special effects in it. The acting was pretty good in the film, and Peter Jackson is a good director. As you may might have known the story carries on from The Two Towers. Frodo, Sam and Gollum are trying to get into Mordor and taking the ring into Mount Doom to destroy evil once and for all. While the others fight off the orcs and the other creatures to defend them. The only part of this film I didn't like, was the ending. It just dragged and dragged for ages. I know that's probably how it ends in the book but come on!. Did the ending have to be 25 minutes long?. It could have easily been shortened down to 10 minutes. Overall, I do think that this film is a very good action/adventure film but it could have got a better score if the ending was a lot shorter. I would give this film a rating of 8/10.  "
99635,tt2096673,AdrenalinDragon,united kingdom,6,It's not THAT good!,"Am I the only one who wasn't blown away by Inside Out? I mean, don't get me wrong. It wasn't bad. Just... alright. Easily one of Pixar's weakest, though. The whole thing felt average and I was wondering if the movie was trying too hard to make people cry. It's hard to explain, but basically it felt more forced than usual. Some of the jokes were a bit hit and miss for me, and as each character is stuck to one trait pretty much the whole time, the jokes become repetitive. I thought Joy was one of the weakest protagonists we've had from Pixar since Brave, and Riley felt like a robot to me so I never really cared about her, unfortunately. It's their most gimmicky movie as well. They go through different parts of the brain just to hope people will be visually pleased enough to look past the weak script and characters. Pixar has been a bit shaky the last three times, as anything not a sequel seems to get an undeserved boatload of praise. It was average at best, but seeing people put it as the best Pixar movie, is utterly baffling to me. 6/10  "
100384,tt0457430,AdrenalinDragon,united kingdom,9,Pan's Labyrinth doesn't disappoint! An extremely well made movie and can't be missed!,"I was eagerly waiting for the release date of Pan's Labyrinth to come, as it was one of my most anticipated movies this year. The day came today, when I saw it at the cinema. I came out, amazed and stunned on how well this movie was made and it truly lived up to my expectations. Pan's Labyrinth follows the story between a girl and his mother, meeting her newly adopted father during a Spanish war. Her new father isn't very nice, and all he wants is something (no spoilers). The girl, named Ofelia then meets up with Pan in a labyrinth, and he tells her that she can be a princess and be an immortal if she does three tasks for him. However, it doesn't turn out as easy as she thought. A wonderful movie is all I can say! It's not an all fantasy movie, it's about 50/50. Half it it focuses on Ofelia and the labyrinth, and the other focuses on the Spanish war. However, it all links up to the ending, so both parts of the movie are important. All of the acting is excellent and the creatures in this movie are some of the best I've seen in a movie. Pan and the Pale Man looked absolutely amazing. All of this topped up with a highly polished and well written story can guarantee this will be mentioned somewhere in the Oscars. Del Toro has truly made a masterpiece, and this is what you really call a fantasy movie. Yes, all of the language is in Spanish but that doesn't mean a movie can't be considered a masterpiece. I quickly got used to the subtitles and I kind of liked the Spanish language used in the movie, since it was set in Spain and would be kind of silly with English. So, overall, Pan's Labyrinth lived up to my expectations. If you've been looking for an excellent, well made fantasy movie for 2006, then this is your answer. Even if you hate foreign movies, you've still got to see it! Well written, brilliant acting, and a creative movie makes this one a movie you can't miss. I'm glad I saw it, and you'll love it too.  "

Everybody enjoys an action movie every now and then, but you could watch Mad Max, with practically any humor. Even if the plot is almost non-existent, it has enough elements to make a consistent and amusing movie. The direction is magnificent and the camera games, perfect, despite being a very moving film, it never gets you dizzy and always maintains your attention. You could describe the film as a post-apocalyptic diesel-punk road (Duh!) movie, or just as an amazing and big persecution with an odd atmosphere, but the interesting thing is that with that kind of atmosphere, most of the movies would look ridiculous, but not this one! and that is thanks to George Miller's excellent labor and to an appropriate use of FX technologies. I'm really not a fan of the original Mad Max movies or remakes, but this film has showed me not to prejudge. Tom Hardy has been an excellent choice to the leading role and it has been a really nice touch to have Hugh Keays-Byrne again as the bad guy.

19243,tt0120737,Adrian,australia,10,Excitement All the Way (nb. may contain spoilers)," The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is quite simply a great movie. It relates to the book by J.R.R. Tolkien very well and some of the characters, like Gandalf, are almost exactly the way I imagined them to be. The length of the movie is fine as well. There is lots of excitement and tension in the movie, as well as a lot of fighting scenes. It also explains the story very well, with the making of the ring etc. This makes it enjoyable to watch. There is some problems with the movie I think. For example, how Arwen takes Frodo to Rivendell is totally different to the book, and also how she makes the flood, instead of Gandalf and Elrond. Apart from this, the differences between the movie and the novel don't really bother me, as it would have made the movie too long to have things like Tom Bombadil and the elves in the Shire in it. All up, the movie is really enjoyable to watch and I am eagerly anticipating the release of The Two Towers in December '02.  "
49384,tt0103064,adrian,united kingdom,10,a film thats alot more than its special effects," Terminator 2 has a rare quality amongst sequels! Not only is it visualy more sophisticated and more realistic in its action sequences but it also has a unique quality, that being its storyline. Many sequels are just money spinners with large set pieces and big scenes designed to hide the lack of story. T2 is a very unique film, not only does it superceed the original but it delves deeper into the story with a darker moodier and more creatively sophisticated vision which is rare for its genre. The story being focused on Sarah and john conner and their battle to stop judgment day and the human race being annihilated by machines. In the first film we see sarah being the target of the terminator but this film manages to be nothing more than a very elaborate comic book adventure, the second film becomes almost artwork, the story is much deeper and more emotionally wrenching as a disturbed sarah struggles with the knowledge of the precise date and time and the events leading to the end of civilisation as we know it. The story is much more focused on the nuclear war and the true elements of the whole terminator story where the first film only scratches the surface and just uses the story as an excuse for Arnie to chase Linda Hamilton around LA. the first film was excellent but the second really dug deep into the story to let it be told rather than just be a guideline for an action movie. T2 was groundbreaking in many ways not only for being a much better movie than the original but with its C.G.I (computer Generated image) breakthrough but this is not used to pull the wool over the audiences eyes it is merely there to enhance the realism of the picture and for us to believe and to tap into the emotional torment and horror that the characters must face with the burden of knowing the end of the world lingers and their battle to prevent the war from happening whilst avoiding the very thing they are trying to save that being the human race. Many films since like jurasic park used the same breakthrough effects but with very different purpose, to hide the lack of story and plot developement but T2 uses it to enhance the already very deep and sophisticated story. Terminator 2's script is emotional, unsettling and disturbing if people would just sit down and take the film in they will realise that this picture is much more than just fancy special fx its a triumph of story telling and movie making and its a credit to James Cameron for not letting the sequel drop into the same pit of nasty films trying to cash in on the success of the original but to make it a significant masterpiece in the world of storytelling.

From the beginning with the very interesting opening credit scene, to the very end, with John Doe and the detectives.

Well, this is just a cool movie... and David Fincher is really good with dvd's. He truly understands sound, picture and overall enjoyment of a movie. Fight Club had a great dvd, and now that the Se7en is released on dvd... we can all be in our happy little basements... enjoying it.  "

I know that maybe I can not comment it like a professional but I can say couple thinks. What impressed me was, as I usually think is the case for great films, the truth of the ideas shown and the great manner in witch was presented. When you see such a movie you say: when we going to learn to ... and here you can put a lot of stuff: simple to live life and not to be greedy or not to desire too much. Some tragic situation that if you think about it you can discover around you that happens to many people on and on. In this movie I think you can see that this is it, maybe this is the human nature, bad luck .. What can be done? Who knows? The characters are very strong and by that I mean you cannot simple not to care about them, not to have a strong opinion about everybody, even about that god dam doctor. I will not give any opinion about every actor; you will find that for sure in other comments. Anyway, I strongly recommend the movie, even only for what Greeks said that can be he effect of a tragedy: catharsis.   "
9723,tt0468569,Adrian Ascencio,united states,9,Freak,"The Dark Knight, specifically Heath Ledger (R.I.P), portrays the true definition of freak. We do not know how the Joker came to be with his dangerous (and genius) character in life. Yet, there are some sorts of clues about him becoming a freak through his depressing monologues in the film. Even though the Joker commits horrid crimes, he is able to express the world's ""true colors"" by them. The one line in this gracious film that sticks out to me (and hopefully to others) is from the Joker saying that people show who they really are during their final moments in life. Yes, Batman is right in saying that the Joker is alone and everyone is different from him (and each other), but there are freaks in this world, no matter what. Human nature has now come to the verge of defining itself as a freak (look at the predicaments that are happening today in this world). Sooner or later, it will be very common in defining someone as a freak that the word ""normal"" will become the irrelevant term for human beings. With all due respect, the Joker is the king of freaks due to the fact that he gains morals (and tons of cash) out of being one, maybe an important one. I am glad to hear that the youth of this world love watching ""The Dark Knight"". Reason being, they are acknowledging significant information from the most notorious villain in comic book history. Honestly, it is astonishing onto how the Joker's role ends in the film: ""You see, madness is like gravity, all it takes is just a little push."" I have the guts to say that I am a freak, but I am not crazy. There is a humongous distinction between being a freak and crazy (I will not go into that because this argument could go on for days). Although it is a movie, please be considerate on how the Joker approaches human life. I think it is safe to say that the morals of the Joker are both life-changing and life-saving. In memory of Heath Ledger. ""You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain."" - Harvey Dent "
57370,tt0078788,Adrian Ascencio,united states,9,"The Realization of Horror and Extreme Prejudice in ""Apocalypse Now""","GOD BLESS America AND GOD BLESS ""APOCALYPSE NOW""! ""Apocalypse Now"" by the legendary, Oscar-winning Francis Ford Coppola is the best depiction of the Vietnam War. It is pretty obvious onto how a dedicated soldier could meet his ""breaking point"" at that time. Honestly, being in Vietnam, fighting the Communists, and experiencing torture for 21 years is brainwashing. There is a tremendous amount of symbolism toward the famous lines in the film, which are ""The Horror. The Horror."" and ""Terminate with extreme prejudice."" Yes, ""Horror"" has a face. But it does not need a friend because it is ""Horror"". Kurtz is seen as a god because he is a friend of ""Horror"". Very respectfully, Willard is mainly the only man in the war to not have the same downfall as Kurtz's and the other soldiers', may they rest in peace. ""Extreme Prejudice"" is self-explanatory, but it means much more than killing an insane traitor. Although America went out to give Vietnam a helping hand, specifically the Southern Government, there is ""Extreme Prejudice"" towards an American who becomes close with Vietnam. Except, Kurtz became WAY TOO CLOSE with ""Horror"" and even a god with a ton of clever morals in ""lIFe"". That is why Willard must ""Terminate Kurtz with extreme prejudice."" Even though a Frenchman said that the Vietnam War is ""the biggest nothing"" in American History, the Vietnam War is not ""the biggest nothing"" in American History because A. the man is French and B. there were plenty amounts of American casualties in the war. Personally, I am a Mexican American and 17 years old, but very patriotic. Other than WWI and WWII, I would enlist in the Vietnam War. Hopefully, if I ever become a doctor and WWIII breaks out, you can definitely, without a doubt, count me in. Reason being, there is no greater feeling than serving for a cooperative, great, and respectful nation. Lastly, I sure do hope that this world does not end in the way the photojournalist said it would, which is for everyone killing each other. GOD BLESS America AND GOD BLESS ""APOCALYPSE NOW""!  "

James Stewart - superbly cast - is sitting next to you and the two of you are watching events on stage, wondering what to do about them since the amount of interaction that's permitted is limited.

96504,tt0041959,adrian chan,united states,10,The Third Man and the Logical Third,"The film's title, The Third Man, announces that it's about triangulation. Shot in brilliant film noir black and white, and set on location in the ruined post-war city of Vienna, the film explores and unfolds mediated relations and on several levels. Most obviously are the interpersonal relations between the film's main characters a woman's (Alida Valli, played by Anna Schmidt) two incomplete paramours, specifically: one actual but absent Harry Lime (Orson Welles), the other a present but only potential lover, Rollo Martins (Joseph Cotten). But the film also explores the indirect and shady economic relations of the black market, and the equally gray morality that seems a necessary means of coping with relations steered from the straight and narrow. Any one of these three themes could make a movie. But the Third Man's brilliance is in its success at playing out its themes using each mode of cinematic expression (story, image, sound). Much of the film is shot with dutch angles (an angled camera, which puts the frame askew). Rollo Martins, a straight up American visiting old friend Harry LIme (whom we don't find till the end of the film), is framed straight up and down. But as he begins to encounter an underground economy (and the film's conclusion is indeed shot in the city's drainage system) of barter, favors, bribes and corruption, the frame tilts. Scenes shot in alley ways also tell of perilous and shadowy pastimes and night times. Scenes featuring our heroine frame her, literally, in windows and doors (though she's not the only one who's framed). The moral choices our hero faces can only bend if he is to find his friend or get the girl (it's not clear which it will be, but by convention he oughtn't get either until he makes the right choice, that is to say, morally right--the right kind of choice according to the film). While Valli refuses to compromise her principles, even at the risk of deportation to the Russian sector (she's Czech), Martins makes trades to keep her in Vienna. And Martins, rather than allow Valli contact with Lime (her lover presumed dead), keeps them apart in order to save her for himself. What Martins tells her, and Lime, is never clearly, nor completely true. The world of film noir is a world in which choices are hazy and relations, being alliances, are subject to change. But our lead actors survive temptations to uphold the genre conventions. It's not till the 50's that heroes, sheriffs, cops, and detectives become morally ambiguous (or ambivalent: Eastwood was not a Wayne). The shift takes interesting shape in gangster films with themes of betrayal. Gangster films began as cops-and-robbers films, in which the contrast of moral choices was portrayed in the high contrast of black and white. But the gang, and a mafia in particular, is a family. The crime of family betrayal (whether to the cops, or to another gang) replaces the black and white of moral distinctions to become the source of tension in films like the Godfather, Casino, and Donnie Brasco. The Third Man's theme of triangulation is where the psychology of indirect relations really comes into the limelight. Philosopher Gilles Deleuze observes that the logic of Alfred Hitchcock's suspense is not the whodunit of a crime, but its ""for whom was it done."" He reveals plot points to the camera (and thus the audience) that are concealed from the film's characters. In fact the audience sometimes knows who has committed the crime from the very beginning; what's not known is the characters' relations to the crime, or its perpetrators, and this unsettles their relations to one another. Their relations are then developed according to the film's logical puzzle (as opposed to their emotional or real relations to one another). In the Third Man the position of third is not fixed but circulates. All relations are not equal, and in the Third Man, Martins, Lime, and Valli must choose their relationships to one another on the basis of muddled events, a shadowy underworld's downward gravitational pull, obfuscating facts and the incomplete observations of witnesses--honest and dishonest alike. Direct relations have difficulty flourishing in a world of indirect and convenient allegiances. But the romantic story-line requires the directness of communication (affection expects honesty and sincerity). If Martins' courtship of Valli is to succeed, he must leave his triangulations and draw a straight and direct line to her. As the film nears its incredible showdown--a standout moment in film-making on its own--the audience knows Martins is facing an almost impossible choice as a friend (to LIme) and lover (not yet but hoping to become for Valli). He must reveal the truth about Lime to the police if he wants Valli to see him. But he must take his action without the supporting angles of a triangle (angled shots of a dutch camera = the geometry of triangles?). It's a decision he can only take alone. And this is how it plays out. He takes the gun in his own hands and without the cover of the police in the waterways with him, confronts Lime for his immorality. He pulls the trigger, his act resounding with an echo against concrete tunnel walls, and in the back lit white of a dark passage way, Martins, now looking much a Western hero, walks his straight line back to the world above. We do not know if he gets the girl. The film begins with Martins noticing Valli, who is walking a straight line directly down the center of a straight road. He meets her again on the same road, after the same burial (this time it is Lime's body in the ground, put to rest where he belongs), and she doesn't look his way. The audience, however, knows that he is now on the same path, and that his choices have made him a candidate, at least, for a position in a romantic partnership.  "
137337,tt0079944,adrian chan,united states,10,Poetic vision,"One of the finest films made, and my favorite Tarkovsky. Eastern European and Russian films in particular are simply differently crafted. Tarkovsky produces images of laden beauty and poetic vision. The film is a quasi- religious sojourn into the ""Zone,"" where dreams may be realized for the patient few. But as with all Tarkovsky films, the theme here is a conceptual and philsophical dialogue among differing positions, in this case a spiritual guide, a writer, and a scientist. Tarkovsky makes you think, though, through his images. Here they achieve exquisite slowness, time squeezed as if from a stone to create an atmosphere of sublime expectation. I can't overstate the artistic achievement this film represents. It's simply a must-see. Do yourself the favor and watch it. I've shown it to many friends and never have they been disappointed.  "

107196,tt0993846,Adrian Davis,united states,1,The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen...,"The title of my review says it all. The Wolf of Wall Street was literally the WORST movie I have seen in my entire life. My opinion might not be quite so negative if the movie hadn't dragged its disorganized, rambling plot on for THREE WHOLE HOURS. At about the one hour mark I was already checking the clock out of boredom and disinterest, and continued to do so throughout the rest of the movie. I appreciate good film-making, and I appreciate that Martin Scorsese is widely recognized as a film genius, but I think this one was an artistic flop. The movie starts off entertaining, but it never really feels like the film takes off. Instead, I felt as if the film was rambling, always promising to find the point where the action gets good, but never quite getting there. The pacing is slower than molasses, and the dialogue inundated with largely meaningless conversations consisting mainly of expletives. While the movie focuses on Jordan Belfort's (DiCaprio) addictions to money, sex, and drugs, we never see Belfort hit rock bottom as we would usually expect of such a movie. Nor does the movie glorify his addictions, so the audience is left merely absorbing the gamut of his largely taboo experience without any meaning or particular point to it. The nudity in this film, too, is needlessly gratuitous and seemingly serves no purpose other than to continuously drive the point to the audience that Belfort is an uncommonly selfish ass who enjoys the sexual underbelly of the underworld -- a point which could have been made just as effectively with about half the nudity and sexual scenes. Throughout the film we see none of the characters grow, nor do we see their actions have any other consequence besides generating more money, aside from Belfort's divorce and imprisonment at the end of the film, which seem to carry absolutely no weight. The characters are flat and shallow -- not the kind of people you would want to spend three hours with. DiCaprio's performance as Belfort was strong and believable, although the character was so thoroughly unlikable that it was difficult to enjoy his performance. Jonah Hill also gave a solid performance, but again, the character was too unlikable for me to care. Scorsese also used little visual and narrative tricks (such as slowing the film down to focus on a ticking clock flying through the air, or having DiCaprio narrate Belfort's thoughts) to break up the flow of the story that, had they been used more consistently, more frequently, or in conjunction with any sort of meaning, would have had a positive stylistic impact on the film, but their usage was sporadic, giving the film a disjointed and uneven feeling. I will be sorely disappointed if the academy nominates this film for best picture, as it felt more like an unedited rough draft that was prematurely loosed on theater-goers rather than a carefully constructed, polished piece of cinema.

Add to that creditable performances from everyone involved (esp. Robin Williams in semi-dramatic mode), good directing and wonderful musical contribution from Elliott Smith (who was unfortunate not to win a Grammy for ""Miss Misery""), and you have one of the most endearing movies ever. You can tell right away from the first scene that Matt Damon and Ben Affleck are the bestest of friends, and they have several poignant scenes in this movie. Minnie Driver was good as well, and you have to feel for her character. Well, like I said before...those two really should write more scripts, who knows what other stories are stored away in their heads. Watch this movie if you haven't already!   "

The movie felt kind of short though and that's just because I simply wanted more. This is not the kind of movie that lets you hanging for nothing, like other movies (imagine a plot like: the good guy is about to shoot the bad guy; the good guy: ""So we've come to an end.

The performances were decent, not as bad as some people say. While the original star wars trilogy and the matrix may not have had the strongest third installment (who knows about revenge of the sith), the return of the king is not only a strong third installment, it is the strongest and best installment of all the lord of the rings movies.

Starting with the d-day invasion, I could already tell this was going to be an epic movie, and it did not disappoint. The tag line says it all; the mission is a man. But it's not just any man: It's Private Ryan (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Not only that, but his mother is getting all three telegrams the same day. And on top of it all, Private Ryan is behind enemy lines. So, the chief of the U.S. Army sends Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his troops to rescue him. When they finally find Private Ryan, 2 of Miller's men have already died, and Private Ryan does not want to leave his position at a bridge. So what do they do? Blow up the bridge. But it does not have a happy ending as Captain Miller ends up dying in the dramatic climactic shootout. At the end, it shows a much older Private Ryan, looking at the grave of the captain, the man who saved his life. Now for the accurate part: the beginning of the movie. There was a lot of controversy about the level of violence what with the major internal organs shown out of the bodies, but this is what war is. Beyond controversial and not pretty.

And I like it not because of the swears, but because Al Pacino turns in one of, if not, THE best performance of his career. Steven Bauer was great as Manny. However, I felt Elvira (Michelle Pfeifer) was not in the movie long enough, and she did not have a big enough impact on Tony's life. I'm sure most of us all remember Tony for his classic one liners, such as ""Maybe you could handle yourself one of those first class tickets to the resurrection"". Classic.

137827,tt2948356,Adrian Herrera,mexico,9,Wild fun with human quality,"With human warmth, ""Zootopia"" is an emotional and motivational film, with a basic but intelligent humor, and with a plot whose background is understandable for children and suggestive for young adults. The expression ""Never judge a book by its cover"" it is a cornerstone in the structure of the story, as goals related to self improvement. The argument is not quite complex, but is thoughtful but not delves into things that ultimately do not matter in the script, as political and economic aspects.The end is predictable, since from the beginning of the story we know the goals of the protagonist and we know that find a way to reach them, but also shows an unexpected turn when knowing the true villain and his intentions, something similar to what It happened in ""Frozen"" and that in some way perplexes the public. The animation is sublime and very detailed, scenarios are lucid and texture of the fur, skin and clothing of the characters is fantastic with a pleasing level of realism, making evident the great quality that characterizes the CGI of Disney. The low participation of Shakira was somewhat disappointing, considering its extensive mention in the marketing of the film. It includes an interesting social criticism, showing in its outlook a metropolis with a great diversity in its population, whose inhabitants are not spared from being segregated and stereotyped, among which there are those who seek equity and others seeking superiority, and this it is an issue that has caused a stir recently in the United States, the country of origin of the film. Personally, incidental music is one of the most important aspects in a movie, because it gives greater impetus to the emotional aspect of a scene, but the soundtrack of ""Zootopia"" is discreet and easy. The composer Michael Giacchino made a simple job, that although it is not all bad, is not satisfactory, and pales in comparison to its previous soundtrack, which was ""Inside Out"". ""Zootopia"" is entertaining and fun. Revive the charm and genius that characterizes Disney and takes him new horizons.  "

8338,tt0468569,Adrian Messenger,united states,10,Ledger owns The Bat,"In the world of Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight,"" Batman is to the Joker what Dirty Harry was to Scorpio. Like Eastwood's Harry Callahan, Bale's Batman isn't above smashing heads, cars, and civil rights, in his brute-force quest to bring justice to a lawless city; like Andy Robinson's psychopath, Ledger's gleefully nihilist Joker seems to enjoy having the stuffings beaten out of him almost as much as he delights in highjacking schoolbuses and committing murder, up close and personal. I've never been a huge fan of comic book superheroes. The Green Lantern was pretty cool, however I generally prefer guns to super powers, and have always thought there was something a little ridiculous about a man in tights and a cape who flaps around the city, fighting crime. Which is why I was not a fan of the previous Batman movies. However, with ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" director Christopher Nolan has attempted to free the character from the albatross of campy convention, reinventing Batman as a kind of urban ninja. The previous films were all about style over substance, whereas Nolan has re-imagined everything from the batsuit to the batmobile in a way that makes them seem more practical, functional, and--most important--more believable. There's a gritty reality about this Batman. He gets hurt and has to stitch himself up, Rambo-like. He gets bitten by dogs, fer Chrissakes! Moreover, his gadgets don't spring magically from thin air, but are the result of meticulous engineering on the part of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), who is Batman's answer to Bond's ""Q"". In fact, the Nolan/Bale Batman has more in common with James Bond than he does with his own prior incarnations in film and print. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the dazzling ""Operation Skyhook"" scene. With ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight,"" Nolan and his team have worked the minor miracle of making an utterly fantastic character seem plausible, which is no small accomplishment. In so doing, he has also brought a great deal more respectability to the genre. Truth be told, though, ""The Dark Knight"" isn't really a ""genre"" picture at all. Nolan goes about the film as if he's never seen a comic book before, the result of which is a breathtaking departure from every other superhero movie ever made. This isn't a superhero movie so much as it's a hyperkinetic crime thriller mixed with a psychological horror film: ""Heat"" meets ""Silence of the Lambs,"" with a delicious dose of sly theatricality. Everything about this film is exceptional, from the cinematography and visual effects to the fine acting and the snappy, intelligent script. But as anybody knows who has already seen it, Heath Ledger owns this movie the way Al Pacino owned ""Scarface."" Ledger's Joker is a self-described ""agent of chaos,"" out to prove that people aren't worth saving in his own giddily vicious way. During one of several mesmerizing exchanges with Batman, the Joker explains that he's not a monster, he's just ""ahead of the curve."" Ledger's performance is an elliptical masterpiece of existential rage and sardonic wit, alternately ferocious and funny. The brief but brilliant scene of the Joker, dressed in an ill-fitting nurse's outfit, fiddling with a malfunctioning detonator, was clearly an audience favorite if the applause and laughter were any indication. Can't say too much more about the film without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it. Suffice it to say, even if you're not a fan of superhero movies, ""The Dark Knight"" is what great movie-making is all about. So, why so serious? Get out and see it!

18837,tt0120737,Adrian Nicolae Neacsu,romania,10,Best film series you will ever watch.,"Best film series you will ever watch. This review applies to all three movies. I love this movie. Great storyline, amazing effects, good actors, great battles and fights, a lot of suspense, great acting and a truly breath-taking soundtrack. Overall, an amazing journey that you will enjoy it every minute. The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and stunning landscapes. Peter Jackson brought to life the vision of The Lord of The Rings to the big screen, not a single thing he could have made it better. I don't know how to describe any better this movie, is truly one of the best film ever made, full of magic, stories, love and battle.  "

Words are not enough to describe why you do not realize that over 10 minutes are without sound. It is the most deafening silence I've ever heard. Without dedicated FX software, computers, or digital cameras, it still offers the most realistic void-space-loneliness feeling. It's real. It is happening. You are there. Long shots, like Russian cinema. It's like a Mozart graphic presentation. It is perfect. Mathematically perfect. I am really afraid of writing, of trying to describe what the spectator feels during and long after this movie ends. It is something that haunts you for days, like a previous life you remember in a hypnotic regression. Yes, words are not enough to describe this masterpiece.  "
41076,tt0120815,Adrian Pelliza (peperino@softhome.net),argentina,4,Pure glurge," The reconstruction is excellent. The visual effects create very accurate images. But it's like ""Titanic"" in WWII. A lot of movies has been made on that subject and there are lots of true stories that deserve to be told without such sugarcoated style. Maybe if Spielberg had made a remake of ""The longest day"" with the production used for this movie, he would have made a great movie. He wouldn't have to resort to [SPOILER] the predictable last scene when Pvt Ryan salutes John Miller's grave.  "

The first half hour led me to believe it was going to be good. Edward Norton attending support groups for problems and diseases he pretended to have. Trying to get Seconal for his insomnia. This film could have been so much better. By the way, I do not care for Brad Pitt. Not worth watching. 2/10  "
72555,tt0033467,Adrian Simpson (adrian@asimpson.abelgratis.co.uk),United Kingdom,6,Citizen Kane - Technically Delightful But Terribly Dull," I can watch any film from any year. I like films. That means that I like films because they are entertaining, not just because they are to be applauded for their technical merits. It's A Wonderful Life is my favourite film, because I enjoy it the most. In the same way, I like The Adventures Of Robin Hood, Casablanca, The Night Of The Hunter, Kind Hearts and Coronets, Dead Of Night, White Heat, The Italian Job, The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Star Wars, The Big Chill, Pulp Fiction, Babe, Starship Troopers and The Truman Show because they are entertaining. Citizen Kane, however, is dull. It may have enough technical genius to fill a hundred books on the subject, but as a film that can hold my attention, it fails miserably.  "
15175,tt0167260,Adrian Smith (trouserpress),united kingdom,10,A long way since Meet the Feebles...," As the poster for the recent Scary Movie 3 boldly declares - ""All Great Trilogies Come In Threes"". And thus comes to an end one of the greatest trilogies of all times. No, not Scary Movie but LOTR. I have been to see this film twice now and all I can say is ""Incredible"". There aren't enough words available to describe how I felt at the end of this movie. I've said it before and I'll say it again: Peter Jackson is a genius. He seems like a quiet, overweight, unassuming, slightly eccentric character (Fact: he never wears shoes, which is all well in good in nice clean New Zealand, but he goes barefoot even when he visits London!), but he has had the bravery and audacity to pull off the unthinkable and create three of the greatest cinematic works of all time. The thing that saddens me the most is that it's entirely possible that there will never be films again as moving and breathtaking as these. One of the trilogy's strengths, The Return of the King in particular, is that not only does have it have amazing special effects and completely unbelievable sound design (this film more than any other makes me want surround sound at home), but at it's core it has heart and emotion. You care so deeply about the characters that you cry when they cry, laugh when they laugh and feel fear when they are in danger. This for me is Jackson's greatest achievement. It would have been easy for a lesser director to lose sight of that in a large spectacle picture like this one (think Pearl Harbour), which just proves that Peter Jackson truly is one of the all time great directors and deserves all the praise and accolades that can be heaped upon him. But he's not interested in any of that. He's just happy to be making movies that audiences enjoy. His hobby is now his full time job.  "
22209,tt0120737,Adrian Smith (trouserpress),united kingdom,10,The film of a legend that is destined to become a legendary film.," This movie is the first in a trilogy following Tolkien's epic translation of the ancient records, as they refer to the War of the Ring. This first part covers the gathering of the fellowship and the early part of their adventures as Frodo attempts to take the One Ring to Mount Doom to be destroyed. I don't wish to spoil it for anyone that hasn't seen it yet, but I can let you in on one secret - He doesn't get there by the end of the movie. I say this now because a lot of people I know forgot they were watching the first part of three and were most surprised at the end to see the quest unfulfilled. Parts two and three would be a bit pointless if it was. It's difficult to find the right words to fully describe this film. It is truly one of the most stunning, mesmerising movies you will ever see, and I have not the slightest doubt that The Two Towers and The Return of the King will be as well. The director Peter Jackson, a native New - Zealander, has created something that you will have never seen before. Only a film on this scale could possibly do justice to Tolkien's work, and if he were alive today I feel I can safely say that he would approve. There are however some elements that may well upset the die-hard Tolkien fans among you; most notably the omission of some fairly major characters such as Glorfindel and Tom Bombadil. However with a running time of over three hours, I feel Jackson can be forgiven. He has captured the feel and excitement of the book, and given it a great sense of reality. Tolkien created Middle - Earth to give Britain a mythology to match other great epics like The Iliad, and whilst watching the film you cannot help but believe that this is more history than fantasy. To say that I am looking forward to the release of The Two Towers in December would be too much of an understatement. I can't recommend Fellowship of the Ring enough, whilst I will readily admit that this is not a film for everyone, young children particularly, (despite its PG certificate), or people like my Mum that get motion sickness from fast camera work (she really did throw up in the middle of the film you know!).   "
47597,tt0120689,Adrian Smith (trouserpress),united kingdom,7,I have the solution! (Major Spoilers ahead!!)," Okay, so it was a nice film and all that, but I can't enjoy it now because I've seen such an obvious solution to their problem that now it just bugs me that they didn't do it. Don't read this if you don't want the plot revealed to you -  (SPOILER ALERT) John Coffey showed Paul that it was Wild Bill that killed the little girls, and that is why he turned Percy Wetmore (quite a funny name, which I'm sure was done on purpose) into a vegetable, who in turn shot Wild Bill. Paul then had to explain that Percy just went nuts, and this was in no way connected to John Coffey's magic powers. Later on he can't decide what he is going to do about John's execution, so they end up putting him in the chair. So here's what he should have done: Told the warden that Wild Bill confessed to killing the two girls, and Percy in his loony state shot him in disgust. Therefore John is innocent, and they have four witnesses to back up the story, so they can let John go. He can then live forever with Paul and the mouse and no one needs to ride the lightening. Simple huh? (END OF SPOILERS) Leaving all that aside for a moment, The Green Mile is still a good film, but I don't think it's good enough to be in the top 250. The main problem is that there are two films in there- a top notch prison drama and a supernatural thriller. For me the two elements just didn't gel together to make one good film. The use of CGI jarred with the 1930's setting. They could still have had this guy with powers but I think it would have worked better if more was left to the imagination, not CGI lights and magic flies. This kind of thing probably read well in the book, but there are some things you should definitely leave out of Stephen King adaptations.  "
119739,tt2488496,Adrian Tarkin,new zealand,10,A Pure Star Wars Film,"This movie is truly magnificent, returning the nostalgic feelings of the original trilogy and providing new and incredibly stunning visual power to a series that had all but declined since the release of the prequels. Now I adore Star Wars and that even includes appreciating the story of Anakin Skywalker in the prequel trilogy, but this was absolutely refreshing. It was a wonder to have original cast members in the film to immerse us again in the glorious golden age of the original trilogy, but the force is honestly with the new stars of this soon to be classically remembered reboot. J.J. Abrams did not disappoint and I could tell that many ultra-fans were hard at work ensuring this film met expectations and didn't fall short. This truly captured the adventurous and marvelous feeling of a Star Wars classic. 10/10.  "
82750,tt0338013,Adrian Turner,United Kingdom,10,Surprisingly good," With downbeat - and arguably misleading - promotion prior to release, I'd almost expected this to be a comedic take on ""Vanilla Sky"", with Carrey in his usual spoof role. What I found instead was a unique blend of ""Memento"" and ""Being John Malkovich""; Carrey instead playing the introverted and awkward Joel, who comes to realize the value of painful memories. I won't spoil the storyline here, but Winslet is radiant as Clementine, and Dunst performs admirably as the tragic Mary. This is, for me, undoubtedly one of this year's most surprisingly interesting offerings. Well worth a look in.   "

Reno, Portman and Oldman are brilliant grade A actors, and they really hit the jackpot with this film. When I first saw the movie I thought Portman must have been a young looking 14 or 15-year-old playing the part of a 12-year-old. I was wrong, she was a 12-year-old playing the part of a 12-year-old, which made her character even more realistic. Reno (Leon) and Portman (Mathilda) have a powerful dynamic relationship throughout the movie as a hit-man and orphan who are thrown together in an unlikely circumstance. Their characters are so believable and fascinating, by the end of the film it felt as if Leon and Mathilda were members of my own family because Reno's and Portman's performances was so gripping, realistic and heart felt. Portman is a complete natural talent, she doesn't act, she plays it for real! The soundtrack in the film also hits the right notes. Try holding back the tears at the end of the film when Sting sings 'shape of my heart'. This is a movie not to be missed!  "
124775,tt2267998,Adrian232,united states,9,"Brilliant, well-acted movie","Apparently I missed all the hype surrounding this movie. I came into it half-blind and was just expecting a decent mystery thriller. What I got was a classic film that kept me interested all the way through to the end. Ben Affleck is clearly in the prime of his career and played the role of Nick perfectly. All of the supporting cast and co-star Rosamund Pike do amazing jobs with their characters as well. Trent Reznor's score is also a masterpiece as usual. All around the production is superb. The plot is also intriguing and takes a new approach to a well-traveled genre. Even when predictable at times, the twists aren't made the focus. There are no ""a-ha"" moments, just ""oh sh*t"". The movie switches from mystery to thriller to psychological horror seamlessly, intertwined with elements of dark comedy. My main criticisms are really just two things; The abrupt ending which left me feeling hanging, but is forgivable since it makes for a solid horror element. And the character of Amy turning from passably human to glaring sociopath immediately following her reveal as a manipulative psychopath (despite speaking several times in front of an apparently detailingly observant and critical public). I've read through several of the low score reviews on this site and it seems that most people who didn't like this movie because of the (supposed) plot holes simply weren't paying attention. Almost everything can be explained by a few key points: 1) Amy, while not being perfect in her methods, was very meticulous in her planning. She got Nick to take a walk on the beach alone in order for him to have no alibi for the time of her disappearance, and was very good at predicting the behavior of other people, as good sociopaths do. Nothing was done on a whim until she makes her first mistake and has to resort to desperate measures. 2) Amy was much more poetic in her plot than she was careful, and the police (particularly Rhonda) were always suspicious of the convenient evidence. Ultimately, the police only reacted on the solid evidence they had, and put the loose ends on the back burner. Then before they could really address them, the investigation quickly became outside of their control. Once Amy decidedly returned, she eliminated the suspicion of foul play on the part of Nick and everyone called it case closed. The loose ends didn't really have to be explained, and Amy just handwaved everyone with the tragedy of her kidnapping. (Side note: Amy saw her whole life as a fictional story, since her mother wrote her as one starting as a little child. She chased her fictional counterpart almost to the letter, and in adulthood decided to write her own story which she creates for the public. Her handwave is a commentary on the acceptance of the reader's suspension of disbelief.) 3) The press were camping outside of Nick's and Margo's houses. While Nick could occasionally sneak out on his own, this would have made it impossible to move all the ""gifts"" in the shed without anybody noticing. 4) None of the cameras at the lake house were pointed indoors, they were all security cameras watching potential points of entry. Amy knew this because she could see all of the cameras. This made it perfectly convenient for her to play it up for the cameras by scuffing up NPH's character and faking her rape. Her explanations for all of this is a bit farcical, and make up some of the dark comedy of the movie, but is not horribly outside the realm of possibility. While I'm sure there are some legitimate plot holes, they were hidden well enough that it did not break the suspension of disbelief (at least for me). And for a genre almost comically characterized by ridiculous plot holes (see: basically every movie from the 90's) they did an extremely good job at covering these up. I employ those who had issues with the plot to go and watch the movie again and pay attention to the all-important details.  "
57425,tt0078788,adrian290357,portugal,10,Superlative,"APOCALYPSE NOW is a masterpiece whether you see the truncated earlier version or the more recent, extended version. The direction is superb, the screenplay excellent with its ironical and occasionally over the top depiction of the uselessness of war and of the degradation of moral values. Duvall is memorable as the colonel who loves to wake up to the smell of napalm; Martin Sheen has his best role ever by a mile; Brando is an enigmatic larger than life metaphysic that appears to have won the minds of the enemy but lost his own; the photography is exquisite; and the sequence with the French family in a colonial setting is an absolute treasure. But there is much more to enjoy, from the much repeated helicopter sounds at the beginning of the movie to the vagaries of fighting a war you do not care for. I will always go back to this movie, watch it with pleasure and learn something new from it. A fabulous film that deserves 10/10.  "
95230,tt0053291,adrian290357,portugal,10,"A belly full of laughs, vintage entertainment!","Well, dear fellow film lovers: If you ain't seen this one you ain't seen nuttin'! A few years ago, ""Some like it hot"" was rated the greatest comedy ever made and though I do not much care for -- or believe in -- such ratings the fact is that I was readily in agreement with this one and I continue to think so. It is a film full of verve, sharp dialog, stinging one-liners, quick pace, imaginative chase sequences, and possibly the quickest-witted ending answer in the history of the cinema: Nobody's perfect! Yep, too true, nobody is perfect - but in this movie director Billy Wilder came as close to the Holy Grail of a perfectly directed movie as I can remember: Marilyn was at her most sensual and in the best acting form I ever saw from her; Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Joe E. Brown and George Raft peerless; and the supporting cast of Nehemiah Persoff, George E. Stone, and many others was marvellous. Absolutely no weaknesses in the acting that I could detect. Finally, a word about the outstanding photography in the ""film noir"" tradition yet never interferes with the smooth narrative. What a movie! What a world that was without computers, cellphones, and all the other global technological and economic dictatorship gadgets that control our lives.  "
110155,tt1205489,adrian290357,portugal,7,"Well, I have seen much better from Clint","Clint Eastwood is one of my all time heroes both as an actor and as a director so I was really looking forward to watching this film in which he does both jobs. He also has a knack for depicting the crack in the American dream as illustrated by Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, The Unforgiven, and so forth -- but this time the whole thing appeared to be more about racist Paleface Clint becoming a better person than anything else, so I came away somewhat disappointed. In what might well be Clint's final acting performance (he is beginning to look old and creaky) I witnessed a rehash of all the Dirty Harry and man with no name stuff under the guise of an old man who seemingly cares for no one and is tough as nails but underneath is a real softy. He retains all his well established celluloid courage as an old dog of war that keeps the young and fit criminals in their place. The way he wins over the Asian neighbors that he keeps insulting and turning away really stretches your imagination. But at least the intention is good and it is refreshing to see his exchanges with the untiring Catholic priest who does his utmost to get him to confess and save his soul. In a finale reminiscent of John Wayne in ""The Shootist,"" Clint commits public suicide and apparently places his faith with a number of witnesses that had up to that point been very wary to report anything on the criminal gangs for fear of retribution. Personally, I thought it a pointless suicide. I'd much rather have seen Clint go out blasting away and taking with him a few bad eggs. But that is my obviously very subjective viewpoint. I am giving this film a 7 but 6.5 would be closer to the mark. May Clint live many more years and direct many more great films. This one and The Changeling have provided blips on the lower side of the quality graph but they are still well worth admission price. And - I'm sure Clint will bounce back with more quality films in the near future!  "
125937,tt0469494,adrian290357,portugal,6,Truly repellent characters,"As awesome as the acting is, especially on the part of Daniel Day-Lewis, I came away wondering why I had lost more than two hours of my valuable time watching a film about two souls so cynical and deceitful that they could not possibly add anything to my life or my values as a human being. The last quarter of the movie was also ponderous and turgid. The Oscar given to Day-Lewis was well deserved and the first hour of the film was intense and eminently watchable though the Day-Lewis character was quite repellent from the outset. Once that hour was up the film tragically went one-way downhill, which did not say much for the quality of direction. Photography? Again, quite splendid in the first half, then flopped like the rest of the film. Was Day-Lewis the ultimate incarnation of Satan and a symbol of savage capitalism?  "
149670,tt0041546,adrian290357,portugal,10,How one longs for more of this type of cinema!,"Alec Guinness has long been my favourite actor. His performances in Lavender Hill Mob, The Man in the White Suit, Oliver Twist (1948), and The Bridge on the River Kwai are pretty much unmatched by anyone... except himself as eight characters in Kind Hearts and Coronets. Mind you, Dennis Price deserves plaudits for his towering performance and he too plays more than one character (he also plays his father). Their acting alone would have made watching this film indispensable to anyone who cares even slightly about films. But there are other treasures to it: There is a most enjoyable and eloquent use of the English language with possibly the quirkiest and cleverest dialogue I have ever chanced upon; wonderful diction by all (though in smaller parts, Joan Greenwood with her throaty voice and beautiful Valerie Hobson with her polished accent are too lovable for words); the satire of English aristocracy, its self-preserving immunity and its murderous values; the volatility of fate; and the most successful, witty, and intelligent twist ending I have ever seen. To cap it all, Director Robert Hamer is in his best form ever. The performances he extracts from his ensemble and his use of the camera are top drawer. Finally, for all the clever caper and comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets stands as a subtle cautionary tale. You can only fool some of the people some of the time but never your own conscience.  "
2753,tt0111161,Adrian-30,ireland,5,Best film ever?!," I too was dazzled by this movie when I first saw it; Robbins and Freeman were both fabulous and the story was an intensely happy marriage of the nostalgic and edifying to the tense and disturbing. The theme of success against the odds is rarely so emotive, and the desperate hope and yearning are truly palpable.  But it's simply NOT the best film of all time! Parts of it are cliched, most of it is downright implausible. The symbolism is trite and way too in-your-face, particularly with Freeman explicitly spelling out (albeit touchingly) what should have been the movie's duty to portray.  The ending was a shameless exercise in trying to make the world feel better than it's ever felt before. Films have every right to be manipulative, but when it's this blatant the magic collapses. Or did for me anyway.  Mind you, still a smashing flick. I'm only nit-picking because everybody else seems to be in such a weird frenzy of Shawshank worship.  "
14033,tt0167260,adrian-58,united kingdom,10,An awesome conclusion to a masterful trilogy," Return of the King had such a tough act to follow, especially with its task of drawing such an epic tale to a satisfying conclusion, and it did not disappoint. Potentially, the final part where Jackson ties up a few loose ends was a little protracted but let's not nit pick here. This was a film with absolutely everything. Take away the benchmark raising special effects, especially at the battle for Minas Tirith and you are still left with a story that captures the heart and soul of Tolkien. The character and story development intersperses beautifully with the action and the tension as Frodo and Sam drive on towards the Crack of Doom is electrifying. The ultimate destruction of the ring and the crumbling of Sauron's Tower and realm will remain fixed in my mind forever. There is even unashamed outpourings of emotions with reunions and partings at the end. Peter Jackson has thrown down a very heavy gauntlet indeed with this film. If anyone succeeds in picking it up, then they will be as worthy of the title of King as Aragorn himself.  "

I opted to see Interstellar here because I love big movies, big sound and anything to do with space. Nolan is a master craftsman, and whenever you see a film directed by him, you know that he really cares about the finished product. I went into the movie with a reasonable idea about the film but chose to read only one or two reviews. All I can say is that considering this is his longest movie, something ""interstellar"" must have occurred whilst I was draped in the darkness, because time really did fly. The film was imaginative, funny, wry, emotional and a spectacle. The Imax really bought certain parts to life. As always, there is the odd moment where you find yourself thinking ""what, but.."" but thats just how I felt after watching Inception, so I saw it again, and that movie grew to be a firm favourite with me. Please go and enjoy this film in any cinema, but if you get the chance to see it an a ""real"" Imax, please go. I hear it has the most shots made for an Imax theatre. Enjoy.  "
46437,tt0054215,adriana_nav,united states,9,!better than a lot of modern day horror films!,"I really liked the movie but I don't think that it lived up to what I had expected I to be. Don't get me wrong it really was a very good film but It had been hyped up so much that I thought it was going to become my favorite. The movie is about a young woman who is having an affair with a married man. The man she is having an affair with is not financially stable to be able to leave his wife and pay alimony. When her boss asks her to deposit 40,000 dollars in the bank for him she decides to take the money instead. She decides to drive to California from Arizona to meet him and start a life with him. Her journey there is very suspenseful, she gets followed by a police officer and you could tell that he's onto her. The police officer even follows her into a car dealership where she decides to trade in her car for a new one. At this point I am already jumping out of my seat because of the music that Hitchcock uses to follow the action in the movie. I can see why the soundtrack to the movie made it even better but I couldn't stand it! It was driving me nuts I had no idea when to expect something bad to happen, I guess it did its job because it sure had me at the edge of my seat. I guess the one thing that did bother me was the pace of the movie, I felt like it was just way too slow. Perhaps this is just because it was in black and white so it seemed a little duller and slow to me. When I was watching it I already knew to expect the shower scene to be the best scene of all. I was absolutely shocked that it happened so fast in the movie. This movie is very well known but the shower scene is infamous so for it to take place so early in the movie it really made me wonder where the movie was going to go next. It is the biggest turning point in the movie, but I have to say it didn't really scare me. Don't get me wrong I love the fact that it was not gory but I just didn't think it was very realistic. Im sure that is just because I have already seen so many movies that were brutally gruesome but considering that this one wasn't it definitely made its point without giving away the identity of the killer. The end of the movie was mind blowingly hilarious and terrifying all at the same time, I don't want to give the ending away but its definitely something that you don't see coming. The twist reminded me of the feeling I had when I watched the sixth sense, it was that good! Overall I have to say the movie was pretty good, the climax and twist definitely makes up for any other shortcomings that the film might have had. I just wish I had been around when it first came out, Im sure that I would have appreciated it a lot more.  "

Frankly, I'm not at all surprised. The Disney picture blows this away in terms of sheer entertainment. What Christopher Nolan does not seem to have grasped is the utter absurdity of the main character - 'Batman' is a nut who runs round Gotham City in a rubber suit solving crimes. The 1966 series/movie with Adam West and Burt Ward got him about right - it was played entirely for laughs. 'T.D.K.' takes him very seriously indeed - big mistake. Christian Bale is bland as 'Wayne/Batman', and Heath Ledger's 'Joker' cannot hold a bat-candle compared to Cesar Romero's and Jack Nicholson's earlier portrayals ( had Ledger not been foolish enough to die just before the film opened, I doubt whether anyone would have given it the time of day ). 'T.D.K.' also squanders the talents of the lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal ( brilliant in 'Secretary' ). The film as a whole is bleak, ugly and depressing - not my idea of a fun movie at all. I think I'll stick with the excellent Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher quartet of the '80's/90's. No more 'edgy' Batman pictures, okay? "

A rich man who goes out at night in a rubber suit designed to resemble a bat? Oh, come on! Putting the Caped Crusader in a film like this is like making 'Austin Powers' the star of a Daniel Craig-type Bond film. Worse, the chief villain - The Scarecrow ( Cillian Murphy ) - is another nut, only this one runs round with a sack on his head! Michael Caine's 'Alfred' cannot hold a Bat-candle either to Alan Napier or Michael Gough. The story of this film...well, was there one? All I saw was a lot of fighting with nothing in-between. It has been announced that Warner Bros. are rebooting the franchise once more. Good idea. They need to use the Burton/Schumacher movies as a template for any further entries. This one hit the big screen with all the force of a wet lettuce. Ker-flop!  "

Stayed true to the book every minute. I've never looked at 3 films the way I have looked at these 3. How did they do it? Would they do it again? Say whatever you want about these or any other trilogy for that matter, but this murders every other one (especially Star Wars-Lucas doesn't hold a candle to Tolkien). I think the end is best left unsaid. Brilliant from start to finish, enough said, no more to say....  "
5063,tt0068646,Adriane (adriane7@mindspring.com),united states,10,My second favorite movie of all time.," I am half Italian, so I must comment on this film. It is a part of my family, it is our heritage. Almost everyone in my family owns the trilogy. They are some of the most brilliant films ever made. Francis Ford Coppola is nothing short of the most brilliant director of the century. Everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Marlon and Al. Pacino is his usual genius self. The unfolding of these characters is a story of its own. The 4 Corleone brothers are all very different. Sonny, (wonderful performance by James Caan), the hot-headed, quick tempered man, Fredo, weak and powerless, goes to Vegas to set up business, only to be brought down my Michael. Michael, the most sensible, if not accepting of his family's business, he is the most likely successor of the title. Finally, Robert Duvall (a wonderful performance as well) , as Tom the lawyer and trusted counselor to the Corleone's. Watching everyone on screen and the story of the family is nothing short if genius. Watch only if you have three hours for each movie to spare, and if you like complicated character stories. It's an offer you can't refuse.  "

Once again, everyone in the cast is perfect, especially Joe Pesci (he is hilarious in his role as Tommy), Liotta and I especially enjoyed Lorraine Bracco's performance as Karen, Henry's long-suffering wife. She puts up with so much from him. Scorsese is also one of my favorite directors, and this is his best film. 4 stars, since I can't give it 5. Pure genius.  "

Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George, if only we all had the opportunity to see what life would be like without each one of us. Good at any time of year, not just Christmas.

Bruce Willis is also very good in one of his best performances in a long time as Malcom Crowe, the child psychologist who feels the need to help Cole overcome his problem. The plot thickens at a time when you don't expect it and the ending will leave you breathless! Olivia Williams and Toni Collette are very good in their roles as well. I highly recommend this movie as entertaining, well written and directed, and well acted. More suspenseful and scarier than ""Blair Witch"". Run to the theater NOW!!  "

It was hard hitting, emotionally gripping and void of political correctness. At one point I had to leave the theater because I thought my emotions would get the best of me but I was compelled to return because the characters demanded that you witness their journey however it ended. One of the things that I witnessed that truly moved me was not what I saw on screen but what was taking place within the theater. I saw men & women, young & old, black & white sitting together and experiencing one of the best movies about slavery that I've ever seen. We experienced the full spectrum of emotions together. This is truly a must see.  "

97046,tt0363163,adrianj,united kingdom,9,"Extraordinary, Impressive and Disturbing","This extraordinary film presents in chilling detail the affect of the failure of Hitler's Third Reich. By keeping a close focus on Hitler's bunker and the government district of Berlin we can concentrate on who these people around him were and how they reacted to him and the imminent collapse of the Nazi dream. The acting and direction are assured and the visual impact of the film, both in the claustrophobic bunker and the ruins of Berlin itself, is impressively realised. Part of the horror of the film is that it does all seem so very real - these are real people in a real situation - and that is terrifying. For me though, the most disturbing thing is that although the film recreates specific events of World War II, it stands as a warning to us, today. Hitler, Goebbels et al, had a vision. A vision of purity and truth, a vision that millions of people took to be real, genuine and achievable. The problem with all such visions of purity and truth are that they require absolute fanaticism. For the Nazis there was no alternative, like for Magda Goebbels who could not see any future for her or her children without the Fuhrer. For these fanatics, if you cannot live up to the dream you have failed, and there is no compassion for failure. The truly terrifying thing is that the world is still full of fanatics - be they al-Qaeda, born-again fundamentalists or Balkan nationalists. They have no place for non-believers, and should they ever gain the support that Germany gave Hitler, we risk being plunged into the dark ages again. Traudl Junge's final words of the film are a chilling reminder for all of us, that no one can be 'innocent' when the fanatic calls.  "
115773,tt0167404,adrianj,united kingdom,10,Putting the magic back into the telling of ghost stories," I hardly need to say anything ... or rather I can't say anything that hasn't already been. This is a excellent movie; we've had gore-fests, we've had horror-parody, now is the time for the return of the *intelligent* horror story. 'The Sixth Sense' works it's magic by suggestion; by simply going *just* far enough from normality that the viewer spooks themselves. There are a couple of moments to make you jump, just to make sure you are in the right frame of mind; there are a few unpleasant ghouls, but this is no Clive Barker fright-a-thon. From those simple elements it builds slowly (perhaps a little too slowly) and you start to share in the torment of young Cole as he searches for an escape from all the ""dead people"" who inhabit his world. Eventually psychologist Crowe offers a way out and you sense that the film will have a happy ending and that, as it were, the ghosts will be laid to rest. But no, just when you start thinking all is well with the world, the *real* truth is revealed. It's not a 'Carrie' style heart-stopping moment, but the final twist is so brilliantly played out, you can't help but go back and revisit all those key moments that suddenly make a totally different sort of sense. The beauty, the magic, of this film is provided by the two splendid performances from young Osement (Cole) and Willis (Crowe) drawing you effortlessly into their world, making the unreal palpably real. Knowing that there is a big 'twist' to this film, you may well be able to work it out for yourself, but even if you do, you will surely enjoy this beautifully crafted film, a film that puts the magic back into the telling of ghost stories.

117170,tt2488496,adriankbryan,united kingdom,1,One of the worst movies ever! (***minor spoiler alert***),"Fittingly, on the night when the Oscars were announced, I watched 'Star Wars VII: The Force Awakens' - except they don't award an Oscar for one of the worst movies ever made. The script was bad enough but the dialogue was some of the lamest I've ever experienced. The acting wasn't much better (with the exception of Harrison Ford, who'll be missing in the next episode) and, if there was a director (I know, it was J.J. Abrams), it was not apparent. It made episodes I & II look like masterpieces. Just putting in some characters from a franchise that used to be good is not enough to make a good movie but, sadly, seems to be all too common these days. I'd rather watch 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' 10 times than be subjected to that again!  "

I didn't like how Lleweleyn Moss ends, after running away that far just for disappear in that way being one of the main characters. It's a nice movie to watch. The story is good, good acting, good directing, but not as good to be the best movie. Some things just need more development, maybe the characters, that's the case of Mr Moss and the why he wants the money for (yeah I know $2 million by itself is enough), don't know there's a lot of things missing. Maybe the book has some more info to understand some things.  "
148227,tt0401792,adrianmgarcia,united states,3,3 1/2 out of 10,"This movie is at the very least a half-hour too long. The multiple plots are unbalanced and I had little desire to put the pieces of the stories puzzle together. Midway through the movie I was hoping it would end quickly. I turned to a friend sitting next to me and said, ""This move refuses to end."" The voice-overs for the most part are monotone and dry. Yes the visuals are superb, maybe even unparalleled, yet it seemed as if the rest of the films elements took a back seat and the audience thrown out the window. A stellar cast could not save this movie, especially when those actors were not in peak form (Rosario Dawson and Clive Owen to name a pair). I really wanted to like this movie. I grew up a fan of comics and I'm a fan of some of the Tarentino style films (Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill). However, 10 minutes into the movie you get past the awe inspiring visuals and ask the movie to deliver more. In my humble opinion, it simply does not. It's a film that takes itself too seriously. It doesn't waste a chance to pat itself on the back. It thinks it's full of poetry when it is not. It assumes that people want to connect the dots and that they will be drawn into its dark characters. I simply did not care. I love great anti-hero's (The Stranger by Albert Camus). These guys, though, do not fall into that category. Lastly, what was the deal with the Nazi symbols? I'm not Jewish, but I was bothered by them. Whoever's idea it was, it simply didn't add anything to the movie other than have me think about the holocaust during the movie. Also, the film would have benefited form some of the cynicism towards the church around the time of the sex scandals rather than a period when the whole world is praising the recently deceased Pope. Unfortunate timing. I only mention this because I saw some people walk out. I also wanted to bail, but not because institutionalized religion gets linked to the world of sin (actually much deserved) but because the only corner I wanted to turn in Sin City was one leading out.  "
132894,tt2024544,Adrianna Wellin,united states,10,An amazing portrayal of a slave's life.,"This movie does an excellent job of showing what it was really like to be a slave. The main character, Solomon Northup, is originally a freeman until he is tricked by two men who sell him into slavery. All of his rights are taken away from him as he is sold into what will be the worst years of his life. He is forced to leave his family and friends behind, not knowing if he will ever see them again. His previous lifestyle and identity are to remain a secret in order for him to survive. Throughout his years as a slave he is sold from master to master, who continually get harsher. Beatings and death of other slaves are common, and he too experiences the pain of a whipping. An experience that scares him for life. To us freedom may not mean anything, we do not live with the risk of all of our rights being taken away suddenly. However, during the 1800's, freedom was a miraculous thing. It was the difference between a safe and good lifestyle, or one with pain and suffering. Solomon Northup lost his freedom, and was unable to gain it back again for 12 years. The only thing he wanted was his freedom, it meant everything in the world to him. Everyday that passed without his freedom, meant another day of hard labor, and another day away from his family. Ultimately McQueen does an amazing job portraying the life of slave. The actors and actresses make it feel like you are right there, and deliver a very emotional and moving performance. I really like this movie, 5 stars!  "
135479,tt0093779,adriannafiss,united states,10,My fav,"My favorite movie of all time, hands down. I watched it for the first time in the theatre. As it ended, the audience sat motionless and quiet for several beats, then burst into loud applause as the ending credits rolled. I'm not always so prophetic, but I was incredibly moved. I said to my husband, ""We've just seen the Academy Award winner."" If I had no other basis for recommendation, I would say the breathtaking cinematography and transporting musical score would make a viewing worthwhile . But these are merely the window dressings. The screenplay is enchanting. Also, without an understanding of the historical times, it would be too easy to say simplistically that this is a woman trying to live within the terms of a marriage of convenience and then compensating with pursuit of a doomed passion. What was crafted out of a mishmash of a more-or-less factual account is still a beautiful love and adventure story.  "

This is undoubtedly one of these times: ""American Beauty"" is a Masterpiece, one that will be remembered from years to come as a milestone that opened the second century of film art. Hats off to Mr. Alan Ball for creating such a beautiful gem, that's both entertaining and thought-provoking, and to Mr. Sam Mendes for translating his words to the screen so masterfully and conducting his marvelous cast with such a firm hand. Please, Academy, give them each one their Oscars, and don't forget Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening as well.  "

Too bad some people still have the mentality ""I will never watch a black and white movie"", like I did a couple of years ago. They might never be able to understand what is it like to watch a very well told story. The plot is very simple; 12 men having a conversation about another's life. It starts kind of slow, but once it picks up, you'll be grabbed by the story and the characters. "
13120,tt0110912,Adriano Marizzo,italy,9,Tarantino's Masterpiece,"Let me first start by saying that I like Quentin Tarantino's movies. Not all of them (I didn't care too much for ""Death Proof"" and ""Four Rooms"" ) but most. ""Pulp Fiction"" is a Quentin Tarantino-directed film that intelligently connects a series of stories, involving two gangsters, a boxer, and a gangster's wife, and how their stories inter-mangle with each other. This is for me Tarantino's masterpiece. The writing is magnificent. I found myself laughing tremendously from the dialog, which is great because I enjoy clever writing. The acting was magnificent. John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson, and Uma Thurman were awesome in the movie. Everybody else was awesome as well, especially Bruce Willis. But you have to see it for yourself because I can't describe its awesomeness here. Just be warned that the language is strong, the violence is graphic and some scenes might not be suitable for everybody  "
62367,tt1853728,Adriano Marizzo,italy,7,Close but no Cigar,"I thought QT's previous movie, Inglorious Basterds was just fantastic. Each scene had so much tension built up, its almost difficult to watch the entire movie in one sitting. Django Unchained is much tamer in comparison. It's a pretty good movie, don't get me wrong, but it does not really reach the level of brilliance of Inglorious Basterds. It does have a couple of tension filled moments but not quite as nail biting for me. The actors however are brilliant: Terrific performances all around. The stand out performance for me was Samuel L Jackson. Can't believe that was Nick Fury, incredible! My biggest disappointment was the character played by Christoph Waltz. I felt if his character in this movie was swapped with the one he played in Inglorious Basterds, there would be no difference what so ever. Not sure why Tarantino would do that, except for the fact the Waltz plays that character brilliantly. Overall, I think what works most, is that Tarantino has given this movie some breathing room from Inglorious Basterds, but unfortunately it was a bit too long and slow. Conclusion: if you liked GB, you'll like this one as well but probably not love it.  "
131542,tt1392190,adrian-oien,norway,8,The fresh breath I've been waiting for,"I needed this movie. It is so fresh, the action scenes are unique and the characters are batshit-insane and distinctive, this is the movie I've been waiting for. It is visually stunning, the desert surroundings and the rusty vehicles and weapons really set the post-apocalypse atmosphere the old trilogy had, but in a fresher and more modern way. It is not the most impressive when it comes to story, but hell, it doesn't really matter, it is fun, it is insane, it is freaking MAD. The villains are twice what the original villains were, and the same goes for the chase and action scenes. The one thing I would want to complain about is, it simply doesn't have enough Max. I really hope this isn't the last we've seen of George Miller and Tom Hardy.  "
100379,tt0457430,adrian-stokes-1,united kingdom,10,A masterpiece..,"This film will go down as being one of my all time favourites. Guillermo del Toro has done a fantastic job of bringing together war and the innocence of a young girls mind. There are very few movies where I can say that I think every actor (including the extras!) were brilliant but this is it. A shining star amongst them all must be Ivana Baquero. She takes on the hardest role of them all as she has to portray a young girl trying to cope with her own demons alongside trying to cope with living with a step father and in the middle of a battle field. Sergi L«¸pez as the captain is another classic character, a lovable rogue you can respect as well as loathe. All in all this film has something for everybody. The subtitles (IMHO) don't take anything away from this film as the camera work appears to take into account the reader wont be able to keep up if its bouncing all over the place. 10/10 for me, cinematic brilliance!

16552,tt0060196,adrianswingler,united states,9,"The Good, The Savage, and the Ugly","I'm not going to add much to the very long list of reviews on this one, except to point out that I've never seen anyone critique the title. ""Bruto"" is not ""bad"". It's more ""animalistic"", literally ""brute"". So, I think ""savage"" is the best match. It's MUCH better than ""bad"". I know this genre has many titles and they seldom translate directly, but Sergio Leone's were always literally translated, so I think it's an issue. I'll also add that for purists of the ""every Marxist on the block in Rome in the mid '60s wanted to make a Western""- particularly the Zapatista sub-genre of this filone, this is not the best. It's solidly in the top 10 and most of our top 5, but those that put it at #1 usually don't rate the political content as highly as the style. I rated it a 9- it has plenty of political content and true pasta western themes. I have nothing against it, and do really enjoy it. But not as much as Companeros. It's a statement, but not like The Great Silence. Good character development, but not like The Big Gundown. The trilogy is, without doubt, though, about the most important movies ever made. That's history, not opinion. When people diss the hundreds that came in the following years they seldom note that at least 50 of those are pretty good, not ones you'd want to live without seeing, and none of them would exist without these three.

123089,tt0266697,adrianswingler,united states,1,"If You Like This, Please Get Sterilized","It is depressing to see, looking at the ratings profile of the online voters, how little people seem to appreciate well made films. This movie appropriates every but of grindhouse, martial arts, spaghetti western and comics tropes that Tarantino finds cool. It's cool for cool's sake. He seems to think the audience will sit around and get their jollies off placing which movie every cool moment comes from. Harmless fun? I don't see how it's either, and that's a pretty good take on his films in general. Those things that he finds cool were interesting because of the CONTEXT in which they happened. The story, the actors, the sets, the direction all came together to create something that was special. You can't just cut and paste it into something that has none of the original elements and think it works. Or that it isn't insulting to the original creators. They worked long and hard to accomplish that and he thinks his cut and paste is homage. It's a huge, freakin' insult. It's depressing that so many obviously think as he hopes they will. But what's with his, ""I've opted out of understanding the laws of physics?"" Are people so mindless that they just don't care? Same criticism as above, martial arts films became what they were because of people that worked long and hard at their art. A trampoline and some pulleys works just as well for you? How dead behind the eyes do you have to be to enjoy this? He does that in every movie he makes. A gunshot will send up a wall of liquor bottles, forget that in a convenience store most of all of it would be 80 proof and that doesn't burn with a torch held to it, let alone a single bullet. Is it that people are too stupid to know better? Does he know better? So, I would submit that if you find it cool to be cool for cool's sake as he is doing here, that you should think seriously about the title of this review. Your cool icons wouldn't ever have existed in a world dominated by people that would enjoy this movie. Do you want more of that in the world, or less? If you breed, there will certainly be less of it. Another Tarantino black mass for the brain damage and soccer addled.  "

The genre of comic book requires reader effort and imagination to fill the blanks and join the dots between each frame. So this movie requires the same. Especially true of the more adult comics. There is a mistaken assumption that comics, like science fiction are just for children. They can be for children, like most politics is. However, Frank Miller - like Philip K Dick or Kurt Vonnegut - write for adults. You are not spoon fed anything, except excellent visuals and gloriously dark dialogue and authentic Frank Miller story lines. The who's who cast list each give a glorious and iconic performance. They all wanted to be in this movie. It is worth understanding why they wanted to be there. Thankfully, this movie has not Holywoodized the story in any way shape or form (unlike the first attempt at Dredd and the especially horrible adaptation of Electra: Assassin also written by Frank Miller and illustrated by Bill Sienkiewicz.) I hope you enjoy.  "

After I turned two, my father got the original trilogy on VHS for Christmas. Sure, i don't remember that, but I remember the next few years, when i spent countless hours watching them and by the time i stepped into elementary school, i know every line by heart. I was a lonely child, due to both by nature and circumstances, and these films were my castle, a place I've always felt safe, even in the most fearsome times. (this isn't exaggeration) I'm sure that the movie is not without mistakes, that not everybody agrees with the casting choices or with the plot, but they're gonna write about it, so thank god, I don't have to. I just want to thank you, all of you, who made it happen, that I can relive some of my most precious memories. This film felt like coming home, and being welcomed, and i haven't felt like this in a very long time. Sitting in the theater with my father and crying and gasping at the same time was something that i only remember from my long lost childhood, and nothing can take that away, no bad reviews or overreacting fans.

The artistry, the imagery, the characters-- just the POWER of it all . . . . whoever made this movie was a genius and that violent chick was so cool.

107659,tt0993846,Adrienne Pratt,French Southern Territories,6,Man becomes addicted to making money on Wall Street...,"This movie, although very well done, was a little shocking at times! It was 3 hours long, which was a little bit too long in my opinion. I kept wondering when it was going to be over and that's never a good thing. I am not a fan of a lot of drug use, and if you aren't either, don't see this movie. These people are OBSESSED with drugs. It was really sad. This man, got so wrapped up in his life on Wall Street and making something of himself, that he completely abandoned his first marriage, became a drug addict, alcoholic and complete asshole. As a movie, it was well done, and the emotions from the characters were very strong. For the tiny bit that Matthew McConaughey was in it, I'm surprised he was so highly applauded for his role. I wouldn't see this again ever.  "
134750,tt0405159,Adrienne85,norway,10,"Strong, believable and emotional!","Plot: Maggie (Swank) is an ambitious woman who walks through boxing trainer Frankie's (Eastwood) door with nothing but guts and her wish of becoming a pro boxer, but she is too old in in his opinion. Oh, and the fact that she's a girl doesn't make it easier for her to be accepted. Frankie doesn't like to lose and is convinced he will with a girl boxer. Frankie finds himself being persuaded by Maggie and former boxer Eddie (Freemind) and at last gives in. Then starts the hard work, but Maggie is eager to learn. As other reviewers have mentioned; there are some subplots, but it's more fun if you're not aware of them before after you've actually seen the movie. And you should see the movie. There is a lot more that happens, but you need to see it for yourself. It took a while getting used to Swank playing anyone else than Brandon (Boys Don't Cry), but it didn't take long before I realized what a great actress she is to be able to make the character her own. Swank, Freemind and Eastwood make a great team and that is probably why Eastwood has not included a broader cast when directing. This is quality!  "
48389,tt1675434,adrienneukuk,united kingdom,9,Beautiful film,"After watching this beautiful film I felt two things. Shame at my prior laziness for avoiding any non-English speaking films and excitement for the wealth of films I am about to discover. There is a film world outside of the UK and USA. Anyway I haven't much to say about the film, you'll get a good incite into it by watching the trailer. From the subject matter I assumed at some point during the film I would need tissues to dry my tears which would have made reading subtitles difficult but thankfully I didn't. At times its sad but is also uplifting throughout. Its just a lovely film and may throw caution to the wind by watching it again without the subtitles!  "

The plot is interesting and intriguing, Audrey Tautou's performance is absolutely stunning and Yann Tiersen adds a touch of class with his wonderful music. The film certainly made my day, I highly recommend it to everybody. It is more a story about life than about love in my opinion. The movie is very easy on the viewer, simplicity being on of the things that addicts to it.

I will even go as far as to rank it up there with the LOTR movies, which is saying a lot. I still think the LOTR movies are at the top but Pirates was at least in the same league. Jack Sparrow couldn't have been casted any better, Orlando Bloom continues to prove himself, Geoffrey Rush was excellent as always and the newcomer, Keira Knightley (who is a dead ringer for but acts a lot better than Natalie Portman), was refreshing. The writing was superb, the effects were top notch and I gave it a 9/10. Excellent!  "
8187,tt0468569,adrongardner,united states,10,Fire in the Knight,"Gotham city has seen better days. The Joker's terror campaign has both the public, and even its criminals living in fear. One day, Alfred relates a story of his early days in Burma, to a ponderous Bruce Wane. He tells Mr. Wayne how he and his men began to hunt a jewel thief who was on a killing rampage in the jungle. A man who actually threw the jewels he stole away, because this was just a man ""who wanted to watch the world burn."" Bruce asks Alfred how did they catch him? ""We burnt the jungle down."" The opening images of Batman announces this theme of fire, with the Bat signal simmering among blue flames. Gotham has indeed seen better days. And the opening of the film announces, better days are not coming soon. As the joker announces, ""people will die tonight, I'm a man of my worrrrd."" Oh yes, the jungle is going to burn down, by one hand or the next. In the Dark Knight Christopher Nolan clearly strove to do justice to the Batman character and the world he inhabits to degrees and depths of character rarely seen before in a ""comic book"" movie. He has delivered a true epic. Though he still hasn't a clue how to film fight scenes and also dances a fine line of too much story and too many characters. There was obviously more than enough material here for two movies. However, I am very happy things worked out as they did. The movie is a triumph of vision both in the new realization of the joker, and in the practical manifestation of the Two-Face character. Aaron Eckhart is sufficiently pretty and viscous as Harvey Dent. Heath Ledger is hilariously creepy, yet I feel both probably deserved a little more screen time. Again, Nolan was juggling a high wire act with all these characters and themes, but yes again, I feel he was almost without fault in doing so. Both of these characters will be remembered. With the Joker, Jack Nicholson's turn in 1989s Batman was menacing and funny. A bravura performance for sure. But I think there was a touch of nostalgia, and tongue in cheek humor in how he played the role to keep him from being frightening. Heath Ledger, on the other hand has succeeded in bringing a more truthful version of the Joker's homicidal rage from the comic to the screen. Ledger's Joker is funny, but not ""haha"" funny. There are no hand buzzers or whoopie cushions here. He's really something to behold on screen and I feel both Batman movies' portrayals can live side by side in their interpretations for some time to come. Famously modeled in some way after Michael Mann's ""Heat,"" with Gotham city as the protagonist, the Dark Knight is a chase film of double crosses and revenge killings. It widens the narrative scope of the Batman Begins story-line and confronts the realities of one man's mission and principals to make right, what was once very wrong. This is a film, a true epic film, that engages Batman in a grand struggle against evil, some of which is his own making. Much like in Nolan's ""The Prestige,"" the idea of ""getting your hands dirty"" reminds us of the type of world that created Batman in the first place; a dark world of shadows and shades of gray. The Dark Knight is a poem of nobility and justice; a story about the futility and illusions of control. This is a story of the struggle between two sides of the same coin. One man who wants to burn the jungle down and another who will burn the jungle down to stop him. In the concluding soliloquy Batman says, ""people deserve something better than the truth."" I couldn't agree more. America too has seen better days and this Batman is wondrous pure fiction at the right time. It's a venture down the obscured paths of humanity about a Knight among the darkness. You bet this is better than the truth. This stuff is why we go to the movies in the first place. "
24851,tt1375666,adrongardner,united states,8,Give him the kick,"Great ideas grow like a cancer. Sometimes you never really know where they come from. Chris Nolan has never really had a totally original idea. Like Tarantino, he knows other movies so well, their ideas creep into his work, either intentionally or not. While my words on originality may come as inflammatory, my feeling toward his talent, and films is quite the opposite. He's good - real good. But he isn't original. Nobody is. This is the 21st century folks and its all been done. It is the way he's showing us these familiar things, that keeps us coming back. Except for Di Caprio, who never really convinces as a brooding widower/father, the rest of the band is perfect. Not that any of them are actually interesting, the plot is the real character in Inception. Hans Zimmers score is majestic and hugely epic and Wally Pfister's familiar clean visuals make it easy on the eyes. Much like a new roller-coaster at 6 Flags, Inception is a ride we've been on on before. Dreams, reality and all that jazz, but this one has a deeper dose of rabbit hole. We have a heist film set in the frame of corporate psychological espionage - whatever the hell that is. We get Matrix style pseudo reality and weightless gun fights. We get The Game and Total Recall style onion layers. We get the old man in the bedroom of cubist proportions from the Kubrick 2001 finale. Maybe one too many James Bond ski battles. And I'm just getting warmed up. The wife story rings hollow - in fact, it's downright boring. Exposition goes in circles and we never do get enough Watanabe Ken. But it's that layered time of the tiered dreams that makes this one go boom. The elevator that can't drop and that van that just falls forever with the cameras over cranking at 150 frames per second or more. But we don't want it to hit the water. Go deeper Cobb, cause I don't want to get off this one yet. The final joke with the unending spinner? This is Nolan's dream, not Cobb's. It's not visionary, it's not original, but just like the meandering Dark Knight or the wretched nonsense of the Prestige, or the titanic plot holes of Memento, Inception is a rabbit hole that owns you∂ˇtil∂ˇit's over. This ain't art or philosophy to ride to the top. It's just one great kick all the way down. 8/10  "
29826,tt0099685,adrongardner,united states,10,Vinney don't put too many onions in the sauce,"After sitting down and re watching the heavyweights of the Scorsese library, a few things can be said. Taxi Driver is overrated. Raging Bull is humble and beautiful, but frankly, boring. And Goodfellas? It holds up like the pyramids. In 2010 the movie is just as powerful, just as mesmerizing and just as shocking as the first time I saw it in 1994. Few films hold their power after so many years and so many repeated viewings. But this film does and then some. I don't think there's ever been a movie with an opening so shocking and absorbing. Something goes bump in the night and a lonely drive down an empty road transitions into a bloody nightmare. From here on out, you're hooked like a crack junkie. Scorsese is firing on all cylinders here. Where many of his films have touched greatness in one form or another, he never before, nor since, reached the perfection of Goodfellas. Like Paulie slicing the garlic with a razor blade, so too are each of the story's ingredients added. Every performance, every camera move, every edit is perfect. They all mix for a true masterpiece. There is not one onion too many in this sauce. To call this a gangster film, is to do it injustice. Goodfellas is more than that. The Godfather is like Shakespeare. That's cool. But Goodfellas is simply Biblical and in a class of its own. There is a powerful sense of vision at work here. Goodfellas is one of the best edited, best acted, best directed, best photographed and most entertaining films you will ever see.  "
32754,tt0047478,adrongardner,united states,10,7 Samurai is #1,"Seven Samurai is simply the finest motion picture I have ever seen and probably will ever see. On every level this film is flawless. Kurosawa's imagery is so beautifully framed and has an amazing depth-of-field to almost every shot. The sense of depth carries out to every corner of the film. The story is an ageless one of unselfishness. The acting impeccable, this film brings a powerful punch to your stomach and a knot in your heart at every viewing. This isn't merely a Japanese ""western"", Seven Samurai is much more than that. This is a picture too few have seen. While the Godfather is the trendy choice of best film ever made (and it is quite good) Seven Samurai is so timeless, so truthful, so genuine, and so powerful I can't think of any other film that even comes close.

47056,tt0082971,adrongardner,united states,10,Raiders of lost cinema,"The Greatest adventure movie of all time? Its very possible. This folks is how its all done. Humor, drama, action. Its all here. I think Raiders of the Lost arc is not only a wonderful piece of entertainment, the movie is also a showcase for what is wrong with many modern movies. Including those from both Spielberg and George Lucas. Raiders is a movie that takes off running and never stops. The hocus-pocus story is high- cheese, yet we never question it for a second. The action set pieces are all good without coming off as overly deliberate or choreographed. It is not until the end are there really any effects to speak of, and this is where Raiders shines. The movie is driven almost completely by the great story and Harrison Ford's immortal portrayal of Henry ""Indiana"" Jones Jr. Later Spielberg and Lucas efforts, most notably the Star Wars Prequels and even Minority Report, are boondoggled with all sorts of visual computer wizardry, but the people and the story are both thinner than paper. Though for a half hour or so it proved to be an amazing theatrical ride, even Saving Private Ryan was plagued by a generic story, generic characters and a director all too obsessed with tanks and Thompson machine guns than the thoughts of the men carrying them. Raiders of the Lost Arc is old fashioned film-making full of dirt and grit. The sequels all were entertaining but none so convincing as the first. The acting, directing, editing, writing and of course, the amazing John Williams score meld to perfection. Indeed, this is how movies should be made. In the action genre, I don't think any other movie of its era, or even since, came come close other than Die Hard. More than 25 years later, Raiders of the Lost Arc has lost none of its shine. This is a movie filmmakers should study carefully, even the ones who made it. They haven't made much as solid as this since. Raiders of the Lost Arc is one of my favorite movies and probably one of the best movies that will ever be made.  "
50932,tt0407887,adrongardner,united states,7,Take Two,"The Departed is an excellent film. I think the only thing holding it back, really, is the fact that it is a remake. But as far as remakes go, this is a gold standard. Differences from Infernal Affairs are obvious early on. Jack Nicholson's character is clearly elevated far and beyond what was in Affairs. This works out masterfully. Not only does it extend the running time beyond the original, allow much deeper characterizations than the original, but it also gives those of us who know the story well something new to watch. The story is about 80% the same in execution as its Hong Kong cousin. Stylistically the films are very similar, though arguably Infernal Affairs does already owe Scorsese some influence, but I'd say Michael Mann is closer to the style of Affairs. I think the small 'morse code' plot bit in the original was very good, missing in this one. The body falling from the sky is a bit better done also in the original. Differences abound, its amazing to feel how similar the films really are. I think on complete balance, trilogy accepted, I slightly favor The Departed over Infernal Affairs because while I am a huge Leung fan, I think the ensemble cast from The Departed was just much stronger. See em both, enjoy them all.  "
62581,tt1853728,adrongardner,united states,7,Waltz Unchained. Django Unseen,"I applaud Tarantino's drive to write movies only for his actors. In comparison to David Fincher and Christopher Nolan who use the actor as a prop to the plot, Tarantino's every word is to serve the actor first and foremost. Often, it pays off such in the case of Jackie Brown. It can also backfire, however. Inglorious Basterds was simply a Mamet-esque demo reel to the point of being painfully boring. While Django Unchained is a big improvement on Basterds, its pleasures don't exactly come free of charge. Django is a recycling and reworking of the Basterds formula into pre Civil War Texas. Instead of a band of forgettable commandos claiming Nazi souls, we are gifted Chris Waltz and Jamie Foxx claiming bounty poster heads. Waltz is virtuoso and while Foxx is good, he's strictly a supporting role. You never really identify with Django and it's mostly in Tarantino's lap for that. The social aspects will undoubtedly offend with a tiring use of the N- Word and violence that tests any decency, but if you take any of this seriously, the joke is on you. The whipping scenes and table talk violence are all carried over as is the feeling the editor was out to lunch and Tarantino took the print right to the distributor. There's at least twenty or thirty minutes to trim out here that would easily make this good movie into a great one. Also, Tarantino's Aussie cameo is the worst acting performance in a film since Eli Roth's gag inducing turn in Basterds. And Jonah Hill, really? REALLY? All that being said, it's good stuff for the most part. By this point, the violence has been done to death so to speak and I wonder why he bothers anymore with it. Other than QT and one or two other useless cameos, performances are all solid. Sam Jackson really putting a signature stamp on a character that would be tricky, if not impossible to do right in any other hands. It's worth seeing just to laugh your Blazing Saddle butt off for the holes in the hoods scene.  "
69373,tt0169547,adrongardner,United States,1,The answer to the question nobody asked," Despite a few good chuckles there isn't much else I liked about this one. I felt the movie came off like some early mid 80's tv movie. I didn't relate to anything the movie had to say and there was at least two other movies in the last 16 months dealing with guys going to work and insulting, blackmailing, or assaulting their bosses. Both Fight Club and Office Space were far better at it. While I do not criticise too much on the interpetive aspect of the movie, I will just say that I really didn't enjoy this one at all. Depending on what scene I was watching I couldn't decide whether I was watching a porno, a saturday night live skit, USA up all night, MTV""s undressed, Ordinary People, or more porno. Onetime watching this turkey was both once enough and once too many.  "
75186,tt0105236,adrongardner,United States,7,Nice but not that nice,"Dogs is a decent movie, but time has not made it better. I like a lot about Reservoir Dogs. The acting is good and even though the movie is small, we get a convincing Tarantino world painted around us. The dialog is good and funny as we expect but some of the writing is a little dry and plotting slow. The aftermath of the robbery and the history of an informant pervade the entire storyline. The limited set pieces keep the movie simple but also show that it was clearly written with a very low budget in mind, as such it feels limited in scope with some probably claiming that is part of the point. Whatever. I think there are a few scenes that are downright boring. Joe and Mr. White's exchange in the office is a snooze but the ""Comode"" soliloquy Roth memorizes to convince his fellow robbers of his authenticity is brilliant. The violence is effective, but not quite affecting. I wanted more cuts, more sets, more plot. Dogs could easily be transplanted to a stage and many times that's where it feels we are watching it, which to me isn't a good thing. On the whole its a great first film of course. If we only view films in the context of the time they were released, ET and Star Wars would never be surpassed in their brilliance, thankfully that is not the case. Dogs is good, but not as Brilliant as Empire magazine and other Dogs zealots would have you believe. My advice? Show the robbery in silence from a black and white security cam at the VERY end with the credits rolling and you have a better movie. I like it, I really do, but its not a Rashomon or Rio Bravo. Reservoir Dogs is a nice Point Blank. Nicely entertaining, convincingly executed and completely ineffectual.  "
83531,tt0093058,adrongardner,United States,9,Wholly Original,"Full Metal Jacket is unlike any war film that preceded it. Kubrick's minimalistic visual style proves effective. The writing and acting in the early boot camp scenes are so well done, for me this alone qualifies the film for greatness. Ermy's Sergent Hartman is so terrifying and funny, you simply cannot and will not forget his lines or the expressions on his face. The violence in the film are also very impressionistic. No matter how many war films you may have seen before this. The first time you see Full Metal Jacket, the death of Pvt. Pyle is shocking. You feel when Doc J and 8 Ball get hit. The impact of the violence is honest and true. The structure of the film is very unusual. And this is welcome. The movie does not arc like a traditional war film, or traditional film of any kind for that matter. There is no 3 part structure, instead there is boot camp and combat. Before 'Nam and during 'Nam. The scenes that work as asides, like the lament for ""handjob"" and the hooker scene adds nice diversion and humor to the stark There is no showy, ""look at me"" camera shaking. The steady cam work is clean and when there is some shake, its very subtle. All too often lately in war movies, the directors have gone wild with over-cranking and wild hand-held camera shake. The tracking scenes of Ermy in the early scenes are so powerful simply because its not about the movement of the camera, but the performance of the actor. Full Metal Jacket is not about Vietnam per se. It is not just about war per se. It is not Platoon and it is not Saving Private Ryan. This is a good thing, because as good as those movies are in their own ways, Full Metal Jacket is better. This is not a film about war, or battle scenes, it is a film about people. It feels both real and surreal. The quiet death of Cowboy holds power precisely because there is no overpowering score or heroic framing to push the emotion to us. We feel for cowboy because he felt like a friend, not simply a character in a war movie that has his turn to die. While people constantly assail Stanley Kubrick for being cold in his approach to humanity, I think these critics have only their self to blame. His films and characters always have emotions on the screen. The Kubrick stare alone justifies my point. If you don't find emotion in a Kubrick film, then the place the emotion is lacking is in you. At the end, Joker's resolution is not that he has lived and learned. He has not come to warn us of his tale. Instead, Joker marches with his fellow Marines free of fear and content with simply being alive. If you cannot watch Full Metal Jacket and feel something, then maybe Titanic is a film for you.  "
87512,tt0361748,adrongardner,United States,1,This one ain't DeathProof,"Previous Tarantino movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It isn't Inglorious, its disgusting. I saw Pulp Fiction at 14 years old, and I saw it 6 times in the theater. I have an original Reservoir Dogs poster and I think Jackie Brown is a timeless achievement and Quentin Tarantino's best movie. Kill Bill was a huge mess, but it was entertaining. I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterds. The entire point of a film is to entertain and if there is one unforgivable sin a movie can commit, it is boredom. The movie is just a collection of endless and excruciatingly boring scenes of people talking at tables in various languages. There is even one scene where 3 people talk for nearly 45 minutes at the same table, before, thankfully they are all shot. I wished they would have been killed off after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to shut the F**K up. This table talk style is a Tarantino hallmark, but in other films, I actually cared about what they were saying and the people who were talking. Here, I couldn't care less. All of Quentin's films display an enormous confidence, particularly Jackie Brown. But here there is a pervasive feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film. Is it violent? Sure there's torture and scalping galore, but you'd have to remind me. Thankfully, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember I had seen it earlier in the day when until I saw a review headline on MSNBC. He's out of gimmicks and apparently dying to write a novel. But do us a favor QT and spare us the movie.  "
92616,tt0372784,adrongardner,united states,10,New Beginning,"As a longtime fan of the Batman comic I am always glad to hear a new Batman movie. The amazing thing about the Batman character over most other super heroes is that Batman has NO powers. He is just a guy, a rich guy yes, but not super human in any respect. Unlike Superman or most other titans, this guy can be killed and won't come back from the dead, of course the comic brings in new writers and they start another story line parallel for the character. Which is what Batman Begins is all about, a new take. I am a big fan of the Tim Burton Batman film. Batman Returns is a good movie, but it didn't work as good and wasn't as much fun as the first film. The Joel Schumacher films pretty much turned it into a ride at Universal Studios Orlando. Batman and Robin was a sad deprecation of a once great character. Bruce Wayne and Batman had only a small cameo in a movie that seemingly tried to fit every Batman villain in the past 30 years into some part. Thank you David Goyer and Christopher Nolan. Essentially they have turned Batman into a Michael Mann film. Batman Begins is the story about a man who has a tough job to do in a dirty place. He isn't a machine and doesn't live in a video game. We know why he does what he does. For the first time since the first Spiderman, we get an action movie that tells us why the character is in action. The insert scenes of flashbacks of Bruce with his father go a long way in adding up our main character. Thanks to a beautiful, forceful score from Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard the brood of Gotham and the force of the Batman character come to life in a big way. All the actors in the movie play their necessary parts and because they are all so distinguished, we never question if they are even necessary to the plot, frankly we don't care. All the actors are so good we want to see them on screen and just hang out. It is the same feeling I got when I was a kid watching Dean Martin, Ricky Nelson, John Wayne and Walter Brennan sit in a jail and sing just to pass the time in Rio Bravo. Good work by all involved. Comparisons to the elder Batty film of 1989 will come up. Which one is better? Not sure, I think Nicholson was so dang good as Joker for me its a hard call to see anybody reprising that role. Overall I think both films compliment each other. Just as legends in history can be told and retold with pieces of the story changing every time, comic book stories that are so well grounded like Batman can be retold. The band may be different, but the song remains the same.  "
97922,tt0095016,adrongardner,united states,10,One heck of a ride,"Die Hard is one heck of a movie. When I first saw it 14 years ago, some time after it had hit video and HBO, my eyes had been opened to a new type of film. I had seen so called action movies before, but nothing held my attention as Die Hard did. The violence was shocking and at the same time, exhilarating. Only years later would I see the effect the movie had on John Woo and his references to Die Hard in both The Killer and Hard Boiled. The villains were clearly bad, but there was a good deal of charisma they carried along with some welcome humor. The bad guys in many 1980s action flicks all tended to be some evil grinning villain happy to scream, shoot and rape their way to nirvana. In Die Hard, Hans and his GQ group of terrorist/thieves shoot when necessary and have enough human quality to make them believable and entertaining. I had only known Bruce Willis from watching his great turn as David Addison in the TV show Moonlighting. He was witty, smart, and funny. I didn't know Willis could expand until I saw Die Hard. Yes he carries a quiet presence in The Sixth Sense, but I still think he does his most entertaining work in the original Die Hard. He is strong, but funny. Angry but not ranting as the cop from New York. It is a performance full of confidence and fun. The construction of the film is fantastic. Michael Kamen's music score is memorable, Jan de Bont's great lighting give the film a signature look to complement director John McTiernan's skilled use of the camera. The sets are all well made and play their part, as the Nakatomi building is indeed a character along with the other supporting players. The sequel ""Die Hard 2: Die Harder"" was not much but blood and bombs. The bad guys were all mean, ugly, grinning paper cut-outs. There were some memorable pieces to Die Hard with a Vengeance, but they all lack the qualities that made the original so good. You can't just throw in a bunch of bullets and call it a Die Hard movie, that much is sure. The action scenes are fantastic and much emulated. The gun play is messy, loud, and exciting. Again, the level of violence was unlike anything I had seen in 1991, (Yes it came out in 1987, but I was only 7 years old). The sight of a terrorist's legs bursting into chunks becomes a common one as John mows down his opposition. I love the scene where Willis drops the chair rigged with C4. ""They're using artillery on us!"" ""No you idiot its not the police....Its him."" Fantastic. The jump from the roof with the fire hose is another classic moment filmed perfectly in slow motion. As I watch Die Hard today in 2005, one can see continuity errors abound. Plot points don't quite add up, and one begins to wonder how this movie could ever be remade, now that every guest on the 30th floor would have a cell phone to call the cops. I love watching Die Hard. It is a movie made with a skill from a group of incredibly skilled people. Now days as its been ""Die Hard on a this or Die Hard on a that"" this level of originality is hard to come by in action movies. Why watch any knock off when the original is just as entertaining as it was in 1987. **** 10/10  "

Deliberate, omniscient and sedately beautiful. Feeling almost a continuation in ways of Kagemusha, Ran is an intensely artistic stab at Shakespeare's King Lear and some elements of feudal Japanese history and Noh drama. A moral tale of family loyalty the color and intensity of the drama are off the charts, with the castle raid in the middle being absolutely unforgettable and a moving score to match the visuals. If one were to criticize anything, the film is almost too high minded or too deliberate. But by the end, our journey recalls Hidetora's in the film. Under the clouds of a God, we also feel almost unworthy. Kurosawa was THE master and Ran is a fitting display of his grandeur.  "
103670,tt0083658,adrongardner,united states,8,Thinner than a runner on a Blade,"Yeah I like Blade Runner. In fact for years, it was one of my top 5 favorite films. And yeah, I still like it. There's flying cars, Rachel...And then there's all that fog. But after all these years, i do see there are holes here and there, and most obviously, the story is thinner than paper. Make no mistake, the cinematography, the atmosphere, the sheer cinematics of it all are still powerful. Blade Runner is an extremely charismatic film. More than anything, it is just so dang beautiful to look at. The story on the other hand, is less pretty. Though the themes of the film are there, mostly thanks to Philip K. Dick's original source material. But so much work was spent on the look of the film, the characters are clearly an afterthought. There is such an underdeveloped set of characters and story, I'm not sure anything actually even happens in Blade Runner that is worth....well....happening. The android/Deckard undercurrent is there, but it seems thin. It feels thin. It is thin. Now Apocalypse Now ran into similar problems, but there was so much subtext with the material and so much interaction with the characters, there still was some narrative drive. Blade Runner struggles to engage me these days. The look of a film can be a major character just as an actor can be. But I don't think it may be a great movie because of that alone. This ain't 2001. If Blade Runner had a further developed character set, aside from Rutgar Hauer's wonderful Batty, there would be a monolithic masterwork here. Instead, we have an amazing exercise in style and nothing more. I am a professional photographer. I know light. Its my job to do so. I can tell an extremely talented man in the way of Jordan Cronenweth shaped the signature look of Blade Runner with Ridley Scott. Those shafts of light coming from nowhere have so much visual power. So on that basis alone, thin plot and characters aside, Blade Runner is still quite good at what it is, once you settle on that. My feelings about Blade Runner are similar as my feelings for some of the more beautiful women I have been with. I love the film when I see it, but I don't think about it all when I'm not watching it. The only thing left is a fog.  "
104895,tt0112641,adrongardner,united states,8,"Shiny, but not without a few nicks","In 1990, Martin Scorsese unleashed Nicholas Pileggi's hard boiled docu book to the cinema. After viewing it for the first time, I knew than and I am still confident today in 2009, Goodfellas is one of the finest motion pictures that will ever be made, let alone the best gangster movie of them all. Having read the Pileggi book prior to seeing the film, I was surprised how well the writer and director translated the source material. Casino is probably the best Vegas movie you'll see. I'd call Fear and Loathing a close second. Leaving Las Vegas, to me, was well acted, but boring and overly ""arty."" So yeah Casino is a slick piece of craft. Slick cinematography, slick design, slick acting. But the heart and soul we'd find in Goodfellas is clearly missing from this take. The mechanisms of greed, the procedures of skimming are fascinatingly and warmly documented here, but the people are just not very interesting. There is a good 45 minutes of human drama about humans we don't give a shi*t about. But the good in Casino is so good, we forget about the thin characterizations. We forget its too long, we forget, at least a little, Sharon Stone is the only miscast part. Sure its got a few spots, but this one is still pretty bright to watch, even nearly 15 years on. You have to hand it to Scorsese. Even his crappy movies are damned good.  "
121450,tt0477348,adrongardner,united states,8,No Country for Action FIlms,"I don't know if this was the best film of 2007, but it was gimmick-less, thoughtful and absolutely satisfying one. Much of the hits this film seems to take almost completely center on the ending. More than anything, I think that is an audience flaw, not one in the film or the original source material, namely the novel. No Country for Old Men is a story about many things. The story can be dissected in numerous, and even possibly profound ways. But as any good novelist will do with things such as ""context"" and ""setting,"" and even ""language,"" as Cormac McCarthy has done, this is all by design of course. Yes I am being sarcastic. But the point is, the story is what it is. The point isn't the tired clich«∏ of chasing down a bundle of money, its about people. In this case, people who came home from the Vietnam war and in some fashion, brought the war home with them. The story is also, as the title implies, about as Dylan would say, how the times ""they are a changing."" So there ends the analytical session. The Coen's have really found a story made from the ground up for no other filmmakers than themselves. The caper story, qwirky characters and dialog recall just about every Coen Brother's movie in recent memory. Hell, there is even more than a touch of Blood Simple in there. So If the direction is great, and the characters are there, what about the actors? Well Tommy Lee Jones is as good as he always is playing some old coot from way out yonder. Josh Brolin is convincing in every way possible. But it is Spaniard Javier Bardem that elevates what is just another Coen Caper to Art. Bardem's performance is absolutely unapologetic as the oxygen bottle carrying killer. I don't think there is a single criminal or killer since Arnie in 1984s Terminator, that has this much power and persona. So this ending. Well I think most modern movie goers have been trained like dogs. They like a big bang at the end, and in my mind the movie delivered it. But the story was never about killers or money to begin with, it was about people and how times moves on, even if people don't. I don't think any shoot out, or handshake could do the movie any more justice than how it ended. Anything else would have been a damned cheat. No Country for Old Men is a story about the desert. It's a story about greed. It's a story about killing. It's a story about people. Heck, No Country for Old Men is about so many things, it is a movie that gives the audience something to do both during the movie and long after the credits roll---to think! How 'bout that. Now there is something you simply cannot make up. I dare you to even try.  "
124413,tt2267998,adrongardner,united states,3,Presumed Fatal Bound Innocent Attraction.,"The book was terrible and the movie is just as bad. How such a blatant and amateurish rip from Scott Turow's Presumed Innocent and even a dash of Agatha Christie's Endless Night ever found an audience, is beyond me. Look even if the story is drivel and the plot is a giant gaping hole of ""no F****ng way!"" the real problem with this heap is the actors. I never believed for one second Pike and Affleck. Not only do they lack any chemistry dramatically, I'm wondering if Fincher ever bothered to do second takes. Every freaking scene in this ""thriller"" plays so flat. The movie looks flat, it is acted flat and even when you're laughing at how plot holes make the Death Star look like Science Fact, you're falling asleep. So yes, it's trash. It's a massive rip off of a genuinely good mystery/legal boiler novel. But yeah, I just didn't believe any of it. Fincher was on auto pilot. Pike was annoying and Affleck looks like a CGI puppet for two and a half hours. Even if you're fascinated by what drives infidelity, this movie has nothing real to say on the subject other than women are plotting, bloodletting liars and men are philandering victims. There's far better trash out there to eat two hours and some popcorn than this steamer. Gone girl should stay gone. Fincher gave up years ago. After four consecutive duds, I'm not touching anything with his name on it again.  "
126245,tt0469494,adrongardner,united states,7,Of Derrick's and Godfathers,"OK, lets get this out of the way. I liked There Will Be Blood. It has a solid cast, great setting and great performance by Daniel Day-Lewis, but is he ever anything other than great? So yeah, the first third is quite astonishing. But then it drops from astonishing to a slow simmer, and finally to a ""well time to get my jacket, I think this one is almost over."" There Will Be Blood is striking at times, old-fashioned at others. But for much of the film, i believe it is also a bit one note. Also, PT Anderson and DP Robert Elswitt need a better focus puller, either that or this digital projection i saw is out of calibration, it just seemed like there was a lot of missed focus. There Will Be Blood is a lot like The Godfather Part 2. For some people, that is all they need to hear. For some reason, many people think Godfather 2 is vastly superior to the original. I am not in that group of people. How can you possible think Godfather 2 is better than part 1? I mean really now? Back to my point... So Godfather 2 is about the corruption of Michael Corleone. The film begins, and it isn't too long before we notice Michael is quite shrewd, in fact, he is corrupt. Save for the wonderful flashbacks, mostly of De NIro and Bruno Kirby, we watch for 3 hours on how corrupt Michael Corleone is, until the final image and find we are either bored to tears thinking ""Ok I get it, he is corrupt."" Or as some others think ""Oh my this is a profound study of corruption and power! What a masterpiece!"" Riiiiiight. Well the same applies here in There Will Be Blood. The film begins and we are shown a hard- working business man and then all too quickly we find, he is not just hard working, he is greedy. For nearly three hours we see greed in one form or another. In the final scene we lean back and think one of two things. ""Ok I get it, he was greedy."" Or, as many critics or viewers may think, ""My god what a wonderful study on the depths of human greed!"" Riiiiiight. Well much like Godfather 2 or Natural Born Killers, after a few minutes we get the point and then for another three hours, it just goes in circles until somebody is beat to a pulp and the credits roll. Call that whatever you like, but brilliant isn't it. I'm finished.  "
128322,tt0091763,adrongardner,united states,10,"Taylor, how long you got left?","The unwritten rule is a new guys life isn't worth as much, because he hasn't put his time in yet. Chris steps off the cargo plane with his sack to a dusty airfield in southeast Asia. He passes a man with a tired face and a piercing stare. Is this man an apparition, or just a survivor? Perhaps both. In Platoon, even those that go home don't go home the same as they came. Elias walks under the canopy of jungle light with his arms draped around an M249 Squad Automatic Weapon as Jesus is on the cross. Only the second scene of the film and Oliver Stone lays his cards on the table for all to see. He does so because of confidence. Stone knows every frame of this film, not because he wrote it, but because he lived it. The combat is there, but if anything the firefights are the most dramatized piece of the film. Here, the devil is in the details. The ants, the crotch rot, rain fogging up a watch and burning sewer waste. These tiny facets of infantry life testify to the honesty in the story. Sergeant Barnes and Sergeant Elias are the two fathers of the squad, despite neither being the real guy in charge. Each man is an amazing soldier in their own way. And they hate each other for ancient sins unknown. Barnes is an intuitive and tough soldier with the scars to prove it. ""Take the pain!,"" he tells one soldier who is screaming in agony. Elias is a brave and cunning warrior but also humane. Stone uses these two men to show slices of men he actually served with, but also two differing mentalities of a warrior. One ruthless who lost his soul long ago, and the other a selfless man who looks over every man in his group. This conflict between Tom Bereger's Barnes and Willem Dafoe's Elias is the narrative backbone to the jungle odyssey. This is high drama, but never soap opera hokum. Every performance in the film is solid. A young Charlie Sheen does quite well for himself in what is easily the best role he will ever get. Dafoe and Berenger are perfect. For Oliver Stone too, though he has made other great films, I doubt Platoon will ever be topped. Platoon is high drama. The story is dense with conflict. There is a villain. There is morality. Whereas a modern war movie like The Hurt Locker parades its realism through shaky cameras and endless cross-cutting, deep inside it's just Top Gun, Platoon doesn't have the Normandy sequence from Saving Private Ryan. There is no drill sergeant sequence from Full Metal Jacket or Vittorio Storaro's visual poetry of Apocalypse now. But Platoon is the real deal. It's the best war movie of all time.  "
146814,tt0072684,adrongardner,united states,10,"Opulent, Articulate, Masterwork"," Simply put, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is the most impeccable piece of film I have ever seen. There is an incredible sense of depth and care to every image in the film. The quality of the imagery is absolutely perfect. Kubrick also goes to great length to convey the dry nature of the world Redmond Barry roams. To paraphrase Ferris Bueller, ""Everything is very cold and very beautiful."" I have heard many people call this film BORING. That comment just means they have a short attention span. This isn't a movie for the ""Fast and the Furious"" crowd. The characters are interesting and dynamic. The problem is, the world these characters inhibit isn't dynamic. It's static and Redmond tries and tries to fit in. No matter what he tries, his fallacies draw out conflict in one form or another. The saddest of these is in the death of Redmond's son and the fall out with his wife and step-son. Barry Lyndon works on so many levels; technically, photographically, dramatically, and ultimately Artistically. Even more amazing is how Kubrick turned a wordy busy novel into a quiet, powerful drama. This work is a reflection of the master status Kubrick deserves. A photographer who is obsessed with perfection in his images. And a filmmaker who is obsessed with cinema. For me, Barry Lyndon is an unforgettable work of art.   "

You will hear a lot about the length the actors, director and crew went to make things real. But to quote Jack Nicholson quote Stanley Kubrick: ""Jack, it's real but it's not interesting."" There's a lot of good work from every member of the cast and crew of the show here. I commend them all on their fine work. But I did not identify with anybody except Arthur Redcloud's Hikuc, and even then, his appearance is all too brief. This movie would be easier to review if there was more wrong with it, but I cannot offer some academic or faux intellectual retort. My personal criticism is just that, personal. And my personal opinion was I simply did not feel invested in any of the characters in the movie or what they went through. Instead of a journey, surviving to the predictable end feels like a slog. And when it was all over. I really didn't feel anything for anybody. Maybe it's just me. I'll accept that. I«Ònaritu is a master of despair, but he isn't a dramatist and Revenant hasn't advanced his craft. If you are interested in films about the trials of survival or snowy mindscapes, try ""Touching the Void."" The tonally similar, and far more contrived, ""The Gray"" is another one I would rather watch.

I've seriously lost count how many times we have seen this battle fortress ending in a movie, let alone Marvel movies. Yes yet another movie with a flying fortress air ship battle lifted from Return of the Jedi. Look Jedi was the first movie I ever saw. It is burned into my head when I saw it more than 30 years ago and it made this type of action finale what it is today and at this point, there is no reason to do it again. But Marvel keeps digging it up. I don't even give two clasps about Thanos this or Ronan that gobbledygook garbage. That stuff is clearly pushed into the script in heavy portions by the Marvel heads when Gunn was clearly onto something all by himself. There are many many other ways to end a movie without that freaking clich«∏, but I guess the CG for this stuff is prefab. Despite all these misgivings, the movie does succeed. The ridiculous Ronan seems lifted directly from Animal House's Neidermeyer, the movie really lacks any sense of suspense but the exchanges of the Guardians anchor the movie with Mo- Town and 70s pop muzak. Somewhere in there is a better movie without air fortress battles and ""there's to many of them"" quotes lifted from Star Wars, but you'll laugh enough to pay for the ticket.  "

The Avengers is great fun, but it's fading from memory faster than who won last season's American Idol. While fans of Joss Whedon will likely be pleased, I think his victory with the Avengers is a double edged sword. He carefully corrals the thicket of big names here, but in the process we're stuck with a laundry list of clich«∏ scenes, a very weak villain, dialog that exists purely to waste time and characters who rely far too much on their costume to get them through the movie. One can't shake the feeling, no matter whose names appear as writers, the Avengers smacks of committee construction. Excluding Sam Jackson, most of what is here is by the numbers. There are precious few moments of humanity in a story that should be overflowing with it. In this respect, think this movie is a polar opposite of Ang Lee's HULK. A film that was painfully boring, but also full of human touches - it had a style that could have been robbed like a gold mine to add more character in the place of the dreadful and endless expository dialog exchanges before we're shuttled to the MIchael Bay Transformers action scenes we've seen a thousand times by this point. But is it bad? Heck no. The Avengers is ultimately a good time if you can settle for less. There are no motivations for anything in the film other than to recycle everything that's already been done and play it safe to please an audience.

50075,tt0407887,adrossan,australia,1,Save your money,"Well, due to all the hype I went to see this one with great expectations, although I must admit without having seen the parent film Infernal Affairs. What a let down ! Setting the scene is great, and time taken to achieve this is well spent, but for me the film started to drag, with expectation and patience well run out by the time the plot strands began coming together. Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his. But Boston Irish ? Everyone, including the deliverer of the line ""I'm Irish & can live with something wrong the rest of my life...."" failed to convince me of Irish lineage. The accents, the faces, the attitudes were all wrong for souls in torment over doing what they believe they have to do, a basic for Irish/Catholic guilt and angst. The film would have been much stronger with unknowns in several key positions, and for me once the disparate strands were established the rest of the film was very predictable and I wasn't kept guessing - crucial if we are to suspend disbelief and have pressure and tension build in the viewer. DeCaprio fails to convince as a tough guy, despite the convincing scars. He stills comes across as an adolescent fuming after his pocket money's been withheld. Matt Damon looks like an awkward schoolboy, and was even less convincing than DeCaprio about being a cop. Mark Wahlberg sounded like he'd been taught to swear the week before, Martin Sheen was as hard bitten as a kitten and there were so many operational goofs the film became a comedy. A Federal agent running a State operation against his own informer? What a waste of time and budget monies. Only two people knowing about an undercover operation? BULL! Keep sending an undercover back after his nerve's gone ? Garbage ! Permanently deleting a full record (on a State Police computer no less!) without possibility of recovery ? Unbelievable - even children know data can be restored, and the system will keep a record of who deleted the information. For me, the film became a joke and I couldn't wait for the end to arrive so I could leave. By the time the end plays arrived and new players were falling like flies, the audience was laughing out loud at the inanity. Once again, Hollywood takes a good story and ruins it with poor crafting, no matter how well filmed. Very bad casting, a rushed and unfulfilling ending, far too much gore, not enough character substance, one dimensional players and an insult to the viewers intelligence.  "

A man convicted of murder lives in a prison brutally ruled by a sadistic warden and secretly run by a con who knows all the ropes and pulls all the strings. The story is narrated by man named Red, who killed his wife to collect insurance. Everyone is probably thinking ""what an awful man"" and ""I already don't like this guy"" but throughout the story without knowing, you start to actually feel sorry for him and everyone else in the prison. I don't know what it is that Stephen King does but you really start to feel like they all have done nothing wrong. When a man by the name of Andy Dufrense comes to Shawshank on charges of killing his wife Linda Dufrense and her lover Glenn Quentin, who was a golf pro he changes the prison and he becomes a man nobody will ever forget. Andy claims to be not guilty, and throughout the story he tries to prove that. He usually keeps to himself and he has this attitude about him that doesn't seem right for a prisoner at Shawshank prison. He walks around calmly and upright just as if he was talking a walk through the park, this doesn't land Andy many friends. While doing his time in Shawshank he is constantly fighting a battle with these men people call the sisters and his freedom. This book is a very adventurous and somewhat mysterious book, it's probably not suitable for younger readers just because of the language and some sexual content, but I would definitely recommend it to young adults.

51511,tt0407887,adsdmnel,united kingdom,10,Excellence in contrast and delivery,"As ever Scorese has brought together an array of outstanding actors. Jack Nicholson's performance is as usual competent and a well thought out character study. But the gem of the film is Di Caprio, he is awesome it is as though he is growing in stature and becoming a much more grounded actor with immense passion. He really does enlighten the scenes as his character continues to struggle with the conflicts and demons that he faces. He is in the same form as he was in The Aviator in which he deserved an Oscar nomination, maybe a little early to tip him for an Oscar, but certainly worth another Oscar nod for Best Actor. Scorese is such a clever director, this is probably the only mixed form film he has made. The film ventures to the two extremes of comedy and drama within this film, Scorese carefully delivers the most appropriate balance of comedy to lift the gloomy content within this film (for example the very last shot on the window as the film ends). He continually shows his early influences in many scenes, particularly the scene when Di Caprio is following Damon after the cinema visit (enough said don't want to spoil the story), this reminded me of Taxi Driver and Mean Streets. Another great partnership is the combination Scorsese with Schoonmaker's editing. She has won several Oscars when working with Scorese and this is certainly her best work. The editing is snappy and executed superbly, creating immense tension especially towards the climax of the film. Thelma Schoonmaker is an outstanding editor and deserves another Oscar, well done. The complex, clever and intertwining narrative enables the script to follow an excellent structure which never detracts itself away from the core action. Overall an excellent film, well done Scorese!  "

I truly respect Day Lewis's performance being compared to De Niro's Jake La Motta. He was just absorbing, I was in awe with every word, particularly in the Bar Scene when he confronted that Oil guy who he had threatened to cut his throat, you truly saw a demented demon breaking out. He took centre stage and practically took 99% of the film's running time. His performance deserves to be in the top 10 of all time. As for the script it really brought out the period of the time and the film was epic in scale. Beautifully constructed and Best film of the year. Good solid direction and lets not forget Paul Dano's performance. An excellent supporting role, where at least was his Oscar Nomination!!!! Hey, I know Javiar Bardem and was the right choice for the Oscar in that category, but Dano deserved at least a nomination for his over exaggerated (not overacted there's a difference trust me I am employed in this field to train actors).

The economy was terrible, we allowed an idiot to thrust the country into a war we cannot get out of, and the pop culture took a turn for the worst. Whether it's the Twilight films, Jersey Shore, or Lady GaGa, I feel ashamed to be apart of my generation. That was until I discovered Chris Nolan. Chris Nolan has always done great work, but this is by far his best picture. I can see him going to Warner Brothers with the idea for Inception and telling the powers that be, ""Alright, I did the Batman movies, now I want to do something of mine""! Needless to say, if you've saved a major franchise, I doubt a studio will tell you no. The film itself is complex, however isn't impossible to understand. I could see the countless hours of research Nolan did for the film on the screen. You can tell that every little detail was looked at with caution, which made the story an absolute pleasure to watch. The cast was superb, with DiCaprio standing out. People argue that his performance in Inception was almost identical to his performance in Shutter Island. I thought the one true difference was the character he played. In Shutter Island, DiCaprio is an anti-hero who isn't given much of a goal during the duration of the story. In Inception, he's more of an Archietyple hero and is given stronger character traits as well as a set goal to reach by the end of his character's story. When I said that this is what the world's been looking for, I meant that I think we've found a movie that shows how originality will always triumph over re-hashed plots and Michael Bay films. If you're a young filmmaker like I am, the film gives you a renewed sense of optimism in your craft. That your ideas do matter, and they can make a great movie.  "

The fact that it was laced with nudity/porn shows that it is cheap smut. While I understand this was the environment, it was too extreme. I especially dislike the raw anger displayed among characters, This was Scarface without guns meets Wall Street. Bad just bad. There was a great opportunity lost in making this film filled with so many possibles. No wonder the market is where it is today. I did not Leo and that is surprising for me.

Im not going to get into the plot because ill be here all night but ill just tell you why it is so awesome. This is the best cast I've seen at work since heat, with all the a list actors in this you would expect at least one of them to slip up but it just doesn't happen. Matt, Mark, Jack, are at the top of there game but i have to say Leo di caprio takes the cake. He takes you through his emotions like a hurricane and I've seen most of his films and this is his best work. Now to the directing Scorsese takes us back to his crime classics with so much style. From the opening sequence he hits us with one of his fav songs by the stones and then there is no let up with so many excellent scenes that will take this to an instant classic!. One of my favorites involves leo and jack faceing off for about 10 mins and it actually is up there with the restaurant scene in heat. So if you heard all the hype and read the reviews BELIEVE IT. Scorsese's best film since casino period. 10/10  "

Garbage - The plot was wishy washy and contrived. The scene involving the neighbour was so predictable, I almost looked away as it unfolded, not wanting to be right. The film's characters didn't lend any real support to the mediocre plot & script either. It totally frustrated me thinking there must be more to the movie right up to the saccharine (supposedly non-stereotyped) ending. I honestly walked out of this movie shaking my head in amazement thinking I had walked into the wrong cinema. The hype was all wrong. It is truly a movie which appeals to the production line movie goers who want a ""slightly, but not too offbeat"" movie. Renting this movie is a waste of time unless you enjoy movies like ""parenthood"", and ""tootsie"".   "

And most of this violence was gratuitous and wasn't necessary for this particular story. Although it's about the fascists in Spain during WWII and you would expect a certain amount of violence in a story like this it was so over the top I almost walked out at two points in disbelief. Be warned that the trailer doesn't give you any clues of what this film is really about and if you're thinking about taking teenagers forget it. Having said that, it's not without merit but it wasn't what I was led to expect and therefore a huge disappointment. My daughter and husband felt the same way and they can handle violence more than I can. My husband actually thought that the violence in Apocalypto was easier to take because it made sense in that story. This was just too much.  "

16603,tt0137523,adtjoel,united kingdom,10,Masterpiece,"This is a superb movie on so many levels. Sometime movies get mixed reviews from critics due to the concepts or themes portrayed, or lack of understanding of a complex plot - that is exactly the reason here. If you are thinking you are going to see movie that just involves people kicking the crap out of each other, you would be very wrong. It is so much more than that. Just go and see it! The undertone attacks the society we live in today - consumer driven and unrealistic expectations. It also has themes of violence but at the same time has elements of black comedy. The acting throughout is superb - great performances from the 3 main character played by Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter. ***Spoilers*** You may have to watch this movie several times before you fully understand it and pick up on all the nuances but I outline some below. When I first saw this I thought there was something wrong with the DVD because at a few points is seems to flicker (and does) not until I put it on super-slow motion did I realise it was intended. If you slow it down you can see it's his alter-ego starting to form. Not only is this alone brilliant but later on it is revealed that Tyler working at a movie theatre does the same thing - edits movies to insert just a frame or 2 - something you notice but are not entirely was there (like when I first saw it - as I said I thought there was a slight DVD fault). Extremely clever. When he is beating himself up in his bosses office he says ""for some reason I thought back to my first fight with Tyler"" why? Because it was exactly the same situation. How could a fight club possibly form? If you see 2 guys fighting in a parking lot you aren't exactly going to join in - but if you see a crazy guy essentially fight himself you could conceivably approach to see what is going on. When Tyler is banging Marla he speaks to Ed Norton and then slams the door, Marla says ""who are you talking to?"" we get to find out. There are many more instances like that, the film doesn't cheat but when you find out the incredible twist you aren't expecting it. The palette used is superb - bland, subdued, fitting in perfectly with mental illness. Then you get Brad Pitt, looks striking, blonde hair, unusual outfits - He doesn't fit in at all - again, we get to find out why. Superb. The themes about modern society are absolutely bang on too if you think about them. Are you rich and famous? Weren't we lead to believe we could be? Do we need most of the things we clutter our lives with? These a just a few things, there are so many more things you will notice, when you see it again and again. Like I said. Masterpiece.  "

The reason why i was crying and laughing and so on was because the movie made me feel so many different emotions at one time and it changed so quickly but, the way they changed it was flawless. I may be saying this in a really complicated way but i think that anyone at any age should be able to watch this. I know it says rated R on the front but all the partial nudity and innuendos are adult stuff and younger children would not understand...and no there is no sex.

8564,tt0468569,adu30032,india,8,"Good, but you were expecting more from this.","Alas, we have the The Dark Knight, Christopher Nolan's second Batman film. I was very impressed by Heath Ledger's uncanny version to the Joker. He did a very good job as the joker, and full credit to him, but his threats seem to be more to society and less to Batman (we were expecting a much more gruesome conflict between him and Batman). He was a thrilling villain, though. I was impressed by Gary Oldman's positive and honest version of Lieutentant Gordon. Micheal Cain does a good job as Alfred, and so does Morgan Freeman as Luscious Fox. Last but not least Christian Bale does a good job in his portray of batman. In the movie we see many explosions and psychotic menace spreading around from the joker, we see many policemen & F.B.I agents trying to get hold of the situation, we see batman trying his best to save the day. All this is fine, but how about the gruesome conflict we were expecting between the joker and the batman, rather than the Joker just pouncing on Batman with a stick or something? Couldn't he have given Batman a much more tough time with those knives and those weapons of his or something, and then batman emerging victorious, rather than...? There are many thrilling moments in the film also, which I admired. In fact, towards the end Two Face/Harvey Dent seems a very menacing and serious villain. Look maybe the hall that I watched it in had a lot of censored parts so I can't rule that out, but I'm speaking from whatever I saw. The end is also thrilling, the scene with Two Face, Gordon, and Batman. But after Batman does his thing, the film bends down to unnecessary philosophy over good and evil, you'll see what I mean. All in all, a very good effort by Christopher Nolan, but it could have been more intense and sleek, without the unnecessary philosophy in the end. There could have been so much more to it, but anyways. Oh yeah, and if you're going to direct another one, please don't add Robin to it. My verdict 8/10. "
57640,tt0482571,adudewhoiscool,united states,10,Top Notch cast and many plot twists will make this film a must see,"In a modern age where most films are either: remakes, sequels, or prequels it is nice to be able to view a modern day original film. Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine (as printed on the DVD cover) said it best, ""You want to see it again the second it is over."" Christopher Nolan, who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations, in ""Batman Begins,"" does it again with ""The Prestige."" ""The Prestige"" is based on a book, of the same title, that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time, each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick, or how to upstage that trick, could turn into something that would kill one another. First things first, this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie, ""The Illusionist."" What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert, and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot, which will make you say, ""How did I not catch that?"" There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently, ""Are you watching closely?"" You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film. Besides all of the various twists, the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley. Overall, there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction, you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films, you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general, you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. ""The Prestige"" is recommended!  "
97328,tt0081398,adudewhoiscool,united states,10,Raging Bull is top-notch film-making,"After Martin Scorsese finally won an academy award for directing the Hong Kong remake of ""Infernal Affairs"" called ""The Departed,"" this reviewer decided to watch one of Scorsese's known classics. That title was ""Raging Bull."" Is the movie as good as many people have been calling it? Is it overrated? Read this review and find out. ""Raging Bull"" is based off of Jack LaMotta's autobiography called ""Raging Bull: My Story."" This movie focuses on the life and career of boxer Jake LaMotta. Jake's rage and violence made him nearly unstoppable in the boxing ring. Unfortunately, that same anger also drives Jake to beat his wife and his brother Joey and ultimately sends Jake down a self-destructive spiral of paranoia and rage. ""Raging Bull"" is an amazing film. Everything about this film just screams classic. Scorsese decision to shoot the film in black and white was genius. It is a shame that it is rare to see a modern day film shot in black and white. Thelma Schoonmaker, who edited many of Scorsese's films, edited this film fabulously, especially during the boxing scenes. What makes the movie so great is that it is not just a boxing movie, like ""Rocky,"" but also a study of humanized flaws created by their own insecurities. The acting in this film is fantastic. The acting is some of the best this reviewer has seen. Of course, everybody will be talking about Robert De Niro's performance, as Jack LaMotta, and it is for good reason. Another solid performance was from Joe Pesci as Jack's brother, and manager, Joey. The most underrated, and surprising, performance was from, only nineteen years of age at the time, Cathy Moriaty as Vicky. Overall, if you want to watch one of the best movies of all time, go check this out. If you are looking for a ""Rocky"" clone, just re-watch ""Rocky"" again. Martin Scorsese definitely was robbed, as far as an academy award, and it is a shame because this is a fantastic film. See this film; you will probably not be disappointed. ""Raging Bull"" is top-notch film-making. ""Raging Bull"" is extremely recommended!  "
108999,tt0434409,adudewhoiscool,united states,9,V for Vendetta is V for Victorious,"V for Vendetta is an amazing movie. It has everything you would want in a movie: great acting, visually stunning, and it is even thought provoking. ""V for Vendetta"" will not be compared to the original graphic novel, Alan Moore, because this reviewer had not had a chance to read it. With the writing styles of Andy and Larry Wachowski and the directing of first time director, James McTeigue, this movie is something that cannot be missed. ""V for Vendetta"" is a graphic novel written by Alan Moore. This movie tells the story about Evey Hammond and her unlikely but instrumental part in bringing down the fascist government that has taken control of a futuristic Great Britain. Saved from a life-and-death situation by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask, who calls himself V, she learns a general summary of V's past. She then attempts to help him bring down those who committed the atrocities that led to Britain being in the shape it is in. What makes this movie different from your average Hollywood movie is that ""V for Vendetta"" is very well written. This movie is so thought provoking that it has the potential for many hours of discussion after viewing the movie. Not many films can do that and still give you enough action to make it not boring. It has a powerful, yet very controversial, realistic message about what could happen in the near future. There will be no more discussions about this film, or its message, in the review, it is something you should view yourself and determine whether you agree with the message they are trying to convey. The acting was fantastic. Natalie Portman proves that, she can still deliver a strong performance, and she does as Evey Hammond. Her acting ability was definitely not shown in George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequel trilogy. The real star of this movie is Hugo Weaving as the masked V. It is unbelievable how three-dimensional a masked character could be. John Hurt did well, yet at times overacted, as the leader of the country, Adam Sutler. Stephen Rea's character, Finch, was also done very well. There really is not much bad to say about this movie. If you had to choose some, it would be mainly Natalie Portman's accent. The accent was shaky, at times it was great, but at other times it was horrible. Another complaint you may have is about the films marketing. The trailer made it look like a ""Matrix"" action type movie, which it is not. There where some good action scenes, especially one near the end, but it did not last throughout the whole movie like the trailers made you think. Overall, if you want to see a good film done right, go, at least, rent ""V for Vendetta."" If you do not like this film, it is easier to recommend a movie like ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" There is not much else say about this movie, without spoilers, so go out and see this. You will love it! ""V for Vendetta"" is recommended!  "
64292,tt0095327,AduinFox,United States,10,Very touching movie *Definitely worth a watch," Grave of the Fireflies had to be one of the most tragic films I've ever seen. If your new to anime, or don't like it I can guarantee that this movie is as real as any animation, with no giant robots or space invaders. Try to look past the enormous eyes and the non-interactive backgrounds and just focus on the characters and the story. Then you'll understand why I hold this movie in such high regard. This sweet story about a teenager taking care of his younger sister in a time of great tragedy, that is just so sad. The movie had some excellent scenes where the boy tried to cheer up his sister when he was struggling to control his own emotions himself. The story has so many great scenes where it's two children attempting to survive on their own. The true moral of this movie is: You can't beat the system. I have recommended this movie to all my film friends, and it's a very emotional film (I cried). Defiantly worth a watch.   "

But the acting, except for the good Dr. Schultz, is miserable. Everyone is a caricature. If I was black, I'd be offended. Fox doesn't act, he glowers. The settings are all wrong....I mean snow-capped peaks in the South? The firearms are not period correct. You can even see the Italian proof marks on them. No effort was made to put together anything other than a 3 hour endurance test for your bladder. It's cheesy. It's lame. It is predictable. Think of this as a pizza from Chuckee Cheeze. It looks like fun. It has lots of colors. I even looks like it is consumable. But in the end it is just another rotten pizza. Yes, I understand, the director or producer of this knows that everything is wrong. I guess that is part of its so-called charm. But don't call this great cinema. Oscars? What, are you on crack? The best way to watch this film is as part of a Mystery Science Theater 3000. In that way you can at least enjoy the humor. Otherwise, wait for Netflix or the $5 bin at Walmart.

Drugs without end. Scenes without points. Acting without entertainment. But let's go to the board. 1. Sex.....tons of it. This film is pretty well soft porn. But it is also about as sexually exciting as watching a Zamboni polish an ice rink....and about as cold. 2. Drugs.....tons of it. Think of Scarface levels. Hey, drunks are funny, right? Think Cheech and Chong without the laughs. 3. Vulgarity.....worse than Bridesmaids and much less humorous. During WWII, the US 8th Air Force delivered nearly 700 thousand tons of explosives. If each one of them had had the f-word painted on them, it still would fall short of the f-bombing in this movie. But even if the pretty naked girls had been arousing, the drug quantities smaller, and the vulgarity lighter, it still would be a tremendously boring film. I am sure it will be touted as a great movie....a modern Gatsby tale. I am sure there will be rewards. I am sure Tarrentino will rip it off and be declared a genius.

Set the same year I turned 21, this film looks just like the 70s did. Much of it appears a little washed out as you would expect if you were to see film shot from that period. The cinematography is stunning. While I remembered the names of the F1 drivers from that era, I remembered nothing of the story. Don't read up on this before you see the movie. Not knowing what happens only makes this a better experience. This is F1's version of the great Johnny Mac vs. Bjorn rivalry, but with death and destruction and not fuzzy little balls and high dollar rackets. While this is a guy movie, the wifey loved it. About 2/3rds of the way through she told me she needed to go to the sand box and relieve herself. I said, Go. She said, ""I not missing a minute."" There are no minutes to be missed.

133034,tt2024544,AdultAudienceMember,united states,10,Don't expect heavy-handed political messages.,"Expecting to see some sort of race-baiting we-are-good-but-you-are-evil movie, I was very pleased that this is good stuff. The movie is more about Northup's resiliency but also his inevitable slow slide into hopelessness than anything else. When he is finally rescued, it comes as a complete shock because he had given up fighting the system. And there is no shortage of white people in the film who are portrayed sympathetically. This is not a ""whitey has always hated us movie."" It is a tale of how a man with virtually everything going for him is reduced to crushing bondage by a legal system and culture. The really bad people portrayed in the film are shown as being incapable of comprehending that blacks are in any way equal to whites. Grow up thinking such things and the likelihood you will have some sort of glorious epiphany is entirely unlikely. Unlike Schindler's List, a movie that will cause you to look away, be glad you saw it, and swear you will never see it again because of its gut-wrenching images, 12 Years was watchable for me. It is a movie. Everyone and their grandchildren involved are long gone. The Peculiar Institution is gone. No one in the US has been a slave-holder or a slave. He was saved because people who were consistently good, mostly white people, were able to overcome people who were consistently evil, also white people. I went in expecting a movie with a heavy-handed message but that was well-acted and was pleasingly surprised that the movie was well-acted, well-staged, and void of any sort of political message. I have heard people, the same sort who say the Holocaust never happened, claim that the story is nearly complete fabrication. Unlike The Butler, which is about as true to reality as Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, this one holds up well to historical scrutiny. Keep in mind that histories are always written by the winners, in this case the Abolitionists. But the fact that SN spoke kindly of two of his masters tends to poke holes in the theory that this is just another Uncle Tom's Cabin. I take that back. There is a political message. That message is that government can do anything it wants with you and you are essentially powerless. SN was enslaved by the system but rescued by individuals.  "
114700,tt0266543,adv808,canada,10,"Duuuudes, go see it!.."," For a long time, I was (and still am) skeptical about Disney movies, whichever size and shape they come in. About 7 minutes into this one I was saying to myself, ""The artwork is amazing, CG (*I'm a computer person, so I yearn for really cool, CPU-intensive CG*) is totally unrivaled, but the story line sucks so bad, why I am watching another Disney tear-squeezer??"" Well, looks like after 15 minutes of run time Pixar guys had a brief meeting and said, ""Screw you, Disney, we are not letting you ruin another one!"" Please -- bear for exactly 15 minutes of the most syrupy kindergarten stuff (stunning visuals will help you, though you might feel guilty about watching this while wide awake, instead, say, shoveling the snow), and watch the 199% predictable slop explode into one of the most ironic, witty, and -- did I mention that? -- beautifully constructed CG cartoons of all time. Did you like ""Shrek""? Well, this is not exactly ""Shrek"" material, but still IMDB 10 grade. Just because IMDB gives you only 10 points to choose from. On a scale of 100, ""Shrek"" would be 100, and ""Nemo"" would pull about 92. Just sit back, settle yourselves; I repeat, you'll need to watch the first 15 minutes to grasp the plot (though not necessarily, there's enough redundancy in the dialogs for the late-comers (or the denser crowd)), and enjoy -- really enjoy! -- the rest. You will see a couple of scenes where the Disney managers came back and tried to ruin (sorry, save! of course, save from the hand of perverted Pixarians!) the movie, but these episodes were only mildly irritating and quickly dissolved themselves without overall damage to the spectacular, weird and funny world of talking, blinking, breathing, flirting fish. Worth to watch. Most probably worth to own, if anything, just to watch your favorite little charming scenes again and again. Enjoy, /D  "
36714,tt0114814,Advait Kamat,india,10,Mysteries don't get any better.,"You're introduced to five criminals walking into a dingy police station. One look at them and you know that these are the guys who always get mixed up in something funny. They're called to read out something from a piece of paper which they do, ending their lines with a cuss and allowing themselves a hearty snicker. The scene continues and you see each one of them getting interrogated personally by the cops. All of them claim their innocence whilst the cops threaten them and once or twice, answer back, not giving a damn what the cops might do to them. 15 minutes into this marvel of a film and it had me laughing hard and loud. That's the beauty of 'The Usual Suspects"". The film follows the story of Roger 'Verbal' Kint (Kevin Spacey), a small-time con man and a cripple, who narrates his story to the cops about what happened after the lineup, beginning from a small hit-and-run robbery and ending in a waterfront explosion that killed 27 men. His story is about how the five men: Michael McManus (Stephen Baldwin), a professional thief; his partner Fred Fenster (Benicio Del Toro), the smart guy; the explosives expert Todd Hockney (Kevin Pollack), the corrupt cop Dean Keaton (Gabriel Byrne) and Kint, are blackmailed into stopping a drug trade by a legendary and seemingly omnipresent gangster Keyser Soze. As Kint's story progresses, it becomes more and more complex and finally gives rise to a big question: Who is Keyser Soze? 'The Usual Suspects' is unlike anything I've ever seen: fast, cold, dark, unnerving, funny, nasty and spellbinding. It's crude cinema at its finest (how often d'you get to see something like that?). What makes it even better is how director Bryan Singer's got a way to build nail-biting suspense. He never lets you know anything you absolutely don't need to know and gets you the facts on a need-to-know basis. Of course, Singer's not the only hero of this film. The screenplay by Christopher McQuarrie, is one of the best ever written, pure and simple. In the first scene itself, he introduces his characters and you understand them, not wanting to know anything more about them and he doesn't let on much, making you guess what each of them goes through throughout the film. One question whose answer has evaded me for years: How on earth did he imagine all this? McQuarrie's been equipped with terrific imagination and you see that through his writing. This is the kind of film that could've faltered if it wasn't for the splendid performances by the cast. Spacey is sensational in the lead role, wearing a slightly bemused expression throughout the film, he gets you laughing when he wants to make you laugh. Del Toro is equally wonderful as the smart guy whose accent is hard to decode. The editing by John Ottman, who is also responsible for the haunting score, is what makes the inspiring climax hit you like a 1000-ton train at full speed. 'The Usual Suspects' is an underrated classic. It's a superbly crafted suspense-thriller which has elements of a dark comedy. Four years after I first watched it, it still holds the pride of being the only film which I had seen a second time as soon as I had finished the first viewing. If it's on my favorite-films list, I would put it near the top.  "
38597,tt0110413,Advait Kamat,india,6,Engaging but surprisingly hollow.,"How disappointing it is to watch a movie that promises so much but in the end, the product is eventually underwhelming, and your hope ruptures like a balloon when pricked. ""Leon : The Professional"" starts off rather well, builds it story through episodes of violence and cans of milk, but doesn't know what it wants when the action gets going. Leon (Jean Reno) is a quiet, reclusive hit-man living a discreet life in New York City. Methodical, smart and stern, he works assignments for an Italian mob boss, Tony (Danny Aiello). Leon has principles - he hardly ever watches television, always drinks only milk and takes good care of a potted plant which he labels his best friend. Leon's neighbor is Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a brash and bratty girl of twelve, who has a junkie for a father and stepmother, an impertinent stepsister and a four year-old brother, whom she loves. Her father (Michael Badalucco) steals some drugs a corrupt DEA agent, Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) left with him for safekeeping, Stansfield instructs him to return the dope by noon the next day, a warning which the junkie coolly ignores. The next day, Stansfield and his team storm the household and kill everyone they can find, including Mathilda's young brother. Traumatized and angry, she seeks lodging with Leon, the only other person whom she considers a friend. Though reluctant at first, Leon gradually eases in her company. Mathilda wants to learn how to kill, a task Leon grudgingly accepts. In the process, she develops feelings for him, which remain one-sided. As time passes, Mathilda becomes increasingly restless to avenge her brother's murder. Director Luc Besson sets the events in motion with a terrifically tense action sequence early on, a taster of what to expect later on when the plot gets lurid. The prefatory sequence introduces the protagonist in a way that it needed to, with a barging camera that captures the detailed action with curious fervor. The characters are meticulously written and a great deal of attention is paid to level them out, allow us to get familiar with them. In parts, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, reveling in the little occasional doses of humor and heartbreak. Besson weaves the action with the drama skillfully, and though the film limps through many of the sequences, it's fantastically watchable. Boring, it is never. And the climax sequence, a great jolt of pure cinema, is masterfully directed. The biggest hitch with ""Leon : The Professional"" is that it is never the sum of its individual products. An oddly constructed assassin-actioner, there are long, yawning stretches of time when the plot hardly advances. It wants to be about its little protagonist but Besson resorts to not let Leon out of the sight. Which is why, I presume, the trivial romantic angle is introduced, a sub-plot which bears very little relevance to the actual story. And when it does get to its exceptional end, hobbles to it rather, it seems like a tediously-assembled downer. Shame. The entire cast is outstanding. Reno hands in a textured, peerless performance which is full of ferocity and feeling, a rarity. Oldman, whose character is dangerously stereotyped, steals the few scenes he has. The cocksure and amoral agent is a character we so often get to watch but Oldman puts a little spin on it and delivers an ace performance. The surprise package of the lot is young Portman, a brilliantly expressive, supremely confident Portman, who screams 'Oscar' all the way. I find it astonishing that a twelve year-old young actress is capable of pulling off something even forty year-old, experienced actors would sweat to clinch. ""Leon : The Professional"" could've been something more than it is, had it paid a little more attention to its fundamental storyline and not what would please the viewers. I find it galling that a movie of such potential is bogged down by its petty indulgences.  "
50291,tt0407887,Advait Kamat,india,10,One of Scorsese's very best.,"How can you make a storyline that borderlines the implausible work? Ask Scorsese. The master director is no stranger to tackling preposterous story-lines that end up becoming some miraculous films. Take for example the masterful ""After Hours"", in which he demonstrated how you can take a ridiculous story and churn it into some kind of a classic with terrific storytelling. Now, with ""The Departed"", Scorsese concocts one of the very best films of his immaculate career. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a rookie cop, freshly recruited by Capt. Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Staff Sgt. Dignam (Mark Wahlberg) as an informant to help them implicate the Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). He is the perfect bait, partly because of his family's prior involvement in organized crime. Billy starts off slow, catching Costello's attention and slowly working his way up the mob and finally gaining his trust. Staff Sgt. Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is the endearing new officer in the SIU who has everyone's trust, including a psychiatrist Mandolyn Madden (Vera Farmiga). Also, he's Costello's surrogate son who is his mole in the police unit. At first, a simple act of loyalty on both sides quickly turns into a desperate battle for survival when both the men realize the need to locate the identities of each other while trying to keep their identity concealed. As always, it is a pleasure to watch a film where Scorsese protrudes and dissects a crime story with such glorious skill and fervor. Though I haven't seen ""Infernal Affairs"", I can safely state that ""The Departed"" is by no means a flimsy remake, given the uncanny skill with which the story is handled. Take for instance a well-written and superbly etched-out scene where Costello beguiles a young Sullivan by buying him comic books and groceries. It's an honest portrait of how the ingenuous turn into the gullible and Scorsese works wonders by giving it a little piquant twist with the dark humor. It's remarkable how a Hong Kong-based story can be transported to an American setting with such deft precision and William Monahan writes wonderfully, giving the characters enough time and feeling until they become someone you can relate to. The plot unravels with genuine disregard for what happens to everything irrelevant to the story, and editor Thelma Schoonmaker marvelously cuts and trims to keep it rife with violent tension. Peopled by some outstanding actors, the cast is to die for. If a Scorsese film stars the ever-magnificent Nicholson, you don't need another reason why it should warrant a viewing. Nicholson is dazzling as the slightly psychotic Costello and it's pure delight to watch him play a creepy mobster with devilish traits. DiCaprio and Damon likewise are excellent in their respective roles, bringing the urgency and desperation to their characters effortlessly. The rest of the cast is stellar, with Mark Wahlberg turning in a remarkable performance as the foul-mouthed tough cop Dignam, something, admittedly, I had not expected him to pull off. ""The Departed"" is Scorsese's best film since ""Goodfellas"" but it's not as good, sadly. But here is a film that respects its genre and it's one that's not all cops-and-guns but instead goes much deeply and illustrates with ruthless candor what circumstances force us to become.  "
62455,tt1853728,Advait Kamat,india,7,"Brutal, captivating and tremendously funny.","If you thought ""Inglourious Basterds"" was revolting, wait until you see ""Django Unchained"". There is a sequence in the film where two slaves engage in an incredibly brutal brawl and an injured slave endlessly screams from the pain that has been inflicted on him. Moments later, the sequence climaxes and we see the winning slave bludgeoning the injured one to death with a hammer, which is mostly off-screen because the camera lingers on the other characters in the room. The sequence is intensely horrific, strangely audacious, and, in a way that can only be described as occult, fascinating because it says a lot of the characters. ""Django Unchained"" is the second historical epic from the freshly pickled imagination of Quentin Tarantino and the second one where he invents a history of his own, with inexorably gloating pleasure I might add. Django (Jamie Foxx) is a slave who is freed by a German dentist-turned-bounty- hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) from the shackles of a chain-gang. Django, who alone knows how the Brittle Brothers, Schultz's next victims, look like, accepts the offer that Schultz proposes to him. As they partner in bounty-hunting till the end of winter, Django becomes increasingly obsessed in finding his wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), who is rumored to be in the Mississippi plantation Candyland, belonging to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). The plot traces the attempts of Django and Schultz to rescue Broomhilda from the egotistic Candie. In the ingenious world of Tarantino, the only thing predictable is how every single thing will make sense in the end. Gleefully excruciating from the word 'go', it takes a Tarantino to dazzle you with the fastidious violence, made majestic by the magical sound of Ennio Morricone. You can't do much but helplessly watch on as Tarantino's wondrous language protrudes the plot, often punctuating it with brutal gunfights and an irresistible undercurrent of dark humor. In a splendid sequence in the middle which is sure to make you cackle till it hurts, we see a bunch of bumbling Klu Klux Klan members complaining about the masks they have been made to wear. He stealthily, coyly and effectively sneaks in quivering tension in it too and does it all too well. Cinematographer Robert Richardson does his bit, masterfully capturing the flying droplets of blood that land on the flowers beds in the fields. The questions that often come up while watching a Tarantino film are : Has he done too much? Is he trying too hard? Isn't the plot a bit excessive? Yes, on all counts. But, then again, it's Tarantino we're talking about. And boy, has he got a way to do it. Though technically sound, ""Django Unchained"" lacks the finesse and the diabolical cleverness that was much more prominent in Tarantino's last film, ""Inglourious Basterds"". Cramming every single idea that will go with the story is amusingly absurd, but here's an attempt to do it anyway. Close to three hours, the film begins to drag at the end, partly because the director isn't done with showing the heroics of his hero. This leads to another twenty minutes of nonsensical blood splattering, which was completely extraneous. Of the performances, Christoph Waltz, who was brilliant in ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a marvel as Schultz, portraying him with the right amount of swagger and menace. DiCaprio and Samuel Jackson, in a supporting role, likewise are equally good. Foxx is slightly underwhelming as Django but manages to give a dignified performance. ""Django Unchained"" isn't Tarantino's best film, but it's a tad better than ""Inglourious Basterds"" because Tarantino exerts a calm control over the script, something he faltered in in his last directorial outing. It's one film that makes you squirm in your seat even if you're not the squeamish type but it's a gorgeous piece of cinema that's unabashedly well worth a ticket. Succinctly put, it's an outrageous, darkly comic bloodbath that is as appalling as it is entertaining.  "
87060,tt0361748,Advait Kamat,india,6,An ambitious film that falls short of its potential.,"Four years ago, when I first saw ""Inglourious Basterds"", I felt that it was one of the best films based on World War II. However, after repeated viewings, I could not shake off the feeling that it could've been something extraordinary, given director Quentin Tarantino's penchant of a bunch of complex characters populating an exquisitely structured plot. Yet ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a painfully strident portrayal, and a fictional one too, of the events that transpired to bring down Hitler in 1945. What could be more frustrating than to watch a film cripple slowly because the many ideas it chased for over two hours limp towards the end? Tarantino tries too hard to give it a nice finishing touch but instead turns the plot bland. Shosanna Dreyfus (Melanie Laurent), a Jewish girl, watches her whole family being massacred by SD Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz), a Jew-hater, but escapes death and runs away into hiding. Four years later, Shosanna, now owner of a cinema in Paris, is offered to host the premiere of a Nazi propaganda film based of the exploits of Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl), who has taken a liking to her. In the quest for vengeance against the Germans, Shosanna secretly decides to burn down the cinema during the premiere. Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) recruits eight Jewish-American soldiers to take revenge against the Nazis and teach them a lesson in humanity. His ambition is to kill as many Nazi leaders as he possibly can. When Raine learns of the premiere which many members of the German Third Reich will most certainly attend, he cannot resist the temptation to strike the Nazis at the premiere. The film follows the intertwined stories of two parties simultaneously trying to carry out vengeful plans and bring down the Nazi rule. Though the premise of the film is admirably ambitious and wonderfully detailed, it is brought down by the staggering weight of its ambitions. A peek into the world which Tarantino devises with much cleverness sets the ball rolling, for the opening sequence of the film is nothing short of magnificent. The sequence, mostly relying on dialog between two men, is Tarantino at the top of his game, with its disarming wit and love for language. Tarantino sneaks some suspense in it too, and we delightfully succumb to its marvelous execution. ""Inglourious Basterds"" has got plenty of sequences like this, most notably the bar sequence, which is grisly violent and funny at the same time. Tarantino, a writer of great repute, plies the viewer with a generous dose of witty dialog and keeps the humor consistent throughout the film. Cinematographer Robert Richardson effectively captures the lush greens of Germany in his lens and costume designer Anna B. Sheppard follows it up admirably, thus providing the right atmosphere to the film. I quite enjoyed the film's stylized look, though I'm used to war movies being somewhat rugged. ""Inglourious Basterds"" is a well-executed film, and although it has its share of criticism, Tarantino knows his craft well, because the film is thoroughly entertaining. Though some drawbacks can be overlooked, some of them are too derogatory to be done so. For one, I found the film way too shrill for my taste. Tarantino heavily indulges into irony and his reluctance to embrace some of the facts tends to get infuriating at times. Apart from a few actors, many of them hand in over-the-top performances. It's not hard to guess that they're having the time of their lives trying to dissect some of the characters from the pages of history and adequately trying to portray their interpretation of them but failing, some miserably. The deft script is dealt with a hint of arrogance which, in my view, is the film's weakest point. Of the performances, Christoph Waltz is absolutely sublime, easily overpowering his fellow actors by stealing every scene he's in. Pitt's performance is shockingly over-the-top, with his raspy voice trying to give Lt. Aldo Raine an identity which doesn't quite connect. Melanie Laurent is the saving grace of a strangely mixed bag of performances. ""Inglourious Basterds"" has the skill which films seldom boast of but the over-the-top performances and the amusingly ambitious plot weaken an otherwise fine film. It is not Tarantino's best film, but if you prefer fiction over facts, it's one film you've got to get hold of.  "
91046,tt1832382,Advait Kamat,india,10,Magnificent.,"In the opening sequence of Asghar Farhadi's terrific film, we see a couple, who are about to get divorced, sitting quietly. And then, without warning, the terse conversation about their lives and family escalates into a fire-spewing argument. The camera sensibly does not focus anywhere else during that sequence and after everything is said and done, every argument is brushed upon, the scene cuts away, not before vividly capturing the animosity between its lead characters. And that one sequence merits a deserving round of applause for Farhadi's 'A Separation', a scorchingly intense drama about conscience and moral ethics. Farhadi tactfully dissects the human mind by challenging us to confront ourselves as human beings with his beauty of a script and immensely complex characters but breathes real emotions while tension sears through the tightly-wound plot. It's something miraculous this, for the film is something so familiar because these are like the characters we have encountered at some point in our lives and we have heard them have conversations like the ones they have in the film. Nader (Peyman Moaadi) and Simin (Leila Hatami) have been married for fourteen years and have a 11-year old daughter Termeh (Sarina Farhadi). Tensions arise in their marriage when Simin decides o shift abroad for the sake of providing their daughter with a better life which Nader isn't willing to accept. He wants to stay in Iran to care for his father who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Frustrated by her husband's lack of interest, Simin decides to stay with her mother for a while. In her absence, Nader hires a pregnant caretaker Razieh (Sareh Bayat) to take care of his father while he's working. One day, when Razieh has to leave the house on some urgent business, she ties Nader's father up to prevent him from leaving the house. When Nader returns only to find his father's condition has worsened because of Razieh's actions, he pushes her in a fit of rage. What happens next changes the lives of everyone involved. Apart from being a drama about the disintegration of a relationship, the film could also be passed off as a suspense-thriller, solely because of the sharp wit Farhadi so wonderfully weaves into the tense setting. Of the rousing babel that breaks at many points throughout the film, Farhadi is able to articulate himself through his writing, because the characters emote the precise emotions we expect them to. The film intently tries to comprehend the reasons for the actions of the characters it talks about and that's one skill that's hard to perfect. The direction is top-notch, because Farhadi is a remarkable observer of little details. Of the performances, Peyman Moaadi and Shahab Hosseini, who plays Razieh's debt-ridden husband, are standout. Moaadi, playing the grim father and husband, is outstanding. Leila Hatami, who is left out for most of the film, does supremely well in a small role. Sareh Bayat hands in a convincing performance of a complex character and it's easy to relate to her portrayal of a grieving mother. As far as dramas go, 'A Separation' is a nearly-perfect one, and an intelligent film that tragically depicts the depths human nature can sink to, if provoked. It's one film that can compel you to change the way you look at yourself. It's fascinating to see how a few well-chosen words and characters can chisel you into a better human being.  "
91554,tt2106476,Advait Kamat,india,8,Riveting and daunting.,"My first reaction after watching ""The Hunt"" was of affinity. Because that's precisely what director Thomas Vinterberg is looking for as he works up a deftly-crafted drama that's both unnerving and significant. I also knew at once that ""The Hunt"" would be one affirmed adversary for the Academy Award for Best-Foreign Language Film. I haven't followed the works of Vinterberg closely so I had zilch idea of what to expect. Contrary to my doubts, the initial viewing of ""The Hunt"" knocked the wind out of me. The movie starts out as a limping drama and Vinterberg spends a large part of the first hour building his story and characters and giving them enough time to turn into someone we know. How well he succeeds is something you find out in the second half. A jolting drama that works as a rattling thriller, ""The Hunt"" spares no one as it follows the crumbling life of Lucas, a divorced ex-teacher, as he is wrongly accused by a small girl of sexual abuse. Lucas (Mads Mikkelsen) is known to be a quiet person among his friends who wouldn't do anything that'd be classified as illicit. He has a teenage son, Marcus, but his ex-wife disapproves of them meeting up. Lucas works in a kindergarten where toddlers enjoy his presence. Nadja (Alexandra Rapaport), a co-worker, confesses her attraction towards him. Even his ex-wife agrees to let Marcus stay with him for a while. For someone plagued with tragedy for a long time, things start to look up. Lucas occasionally walks his best friend Theo's (Thomas Bo Larsen) daughter, Klara (Annika Wedderkopp), to the kindergarten. A warm friendship develops between the two when Klara takes a liking to Lucas' dog Fanny. One day, Klara's brother shows her a smutty image of a naked woman as a joke, a joke which mentally traumatizes her. Later that day, Lucas shrugs her off, which hurts her. He mental trauma impels her to accuse him of having sexually abused her, a thing which the nursery staff isn't willing to pass. Lucas is ostracized and fired instantly. He is cold-shouldered wherever he goes and by everyone who passes him because everyone believes him to be a sexual predator. Slowly, gradually, his son also meets the same fate. Though some people believe his version of the story, the growing resentment forces him to lash out violently to those who hassle him. Though he builds up a strong defense in front of the jury, Lucas realizes soon enough that he may never be exonerated completely, at least not by the community. One of the things that I was impressed with was that Vinterberg never tries to assuage the wild emotions that the plot is rigged with. And he prefers to let the story revel at his own pace, allowing us to be sucked into the life of its protagonist and see things from his perspective. Although we know who is responsible for the iniquitous deed, Vinterberg makes sure that his movie isn't about the questions and the answers. He simply wants you to observe, to empathize. And the characters he creates are beneficial to that vision. They are someone we know and not someone theatrical. What they say isn't theatrical either. It's just a bunch of people looking for answers, the right ones and the script compliments that mood. It's a tightly-wounded piece of writing that doesn't hesitate to take shots, pull cuffs and ask questions. A lot of questions about morality are raised and are even answered to some extent. The remaining unanswered ones are left for us to mull over. Mikkelsen hands in a towering performance that's at the epicenter of the film. He's wonderfully expressive, easy to sympathize with and efficacious. His breakdown at the Church Mass is a fine piece of acting that's both moving and provoking. He's also guilty of stealing the spotlight from the rest of the cast, who are stellar in each of their respective roles. ""The Hunt"" is a riveting piece of cinema, a terrifically tense drama that bravely asks involuted questions. It's also fantastically engaging, occasionally indulgent, intuitively written, carefully canned and acted to sleek perfection. It's hard to watch, it might even be appalling to some but that's no reason to rebuff it. It's the kind of cinema that you rarely get to see.  "
107983,tt0993846,Advait Kamat,india,8,A firecracker of a film that explodes slowly.,"Wake up and rejoice. The ""Goodfellas"" of our time has arrived, in all its vainglory. As always, it's a pleasure to witness a brilliant filmmaker spin out of control and crank out a transgressive piece of cinema so exhausting that you know that you now have a new milestone movie to scale. And before I even completed my viewing of ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"", I knew I'm going to have to come back to it soon enough. Because there is so much going on, so much you have to watch, assess and enjoy that a single viewing can't do justice to it.∂ˇ It's ridiculously dynamite, like Scorsese, aged seventy-one, mind you, wanted to live out his wildest dreams on screen. They animate like arresting fireworks in the sky, try tearing your eyes away, pal. Crass, it's not. I'm here to affirm that ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is indeed shockingly vulgar and darkly funny, so much so that it makes Sacha Baron Cohen's Borat Sagdiyev seem like a saint. But, hey, we aren't forgetting what we are watching, are we? The material that served as the film's inspiration is Jordan Belfort's own memoir about his doings as a stockbroker in the good ol' 1990s. This is just a wily adaptation of the book. What's the big deal? It's not like he's preaching the kind of lifestyle that Belfort led, he's just studying it. Like we are. DiCaprio's Belfort is an obnoxious man, a sickening voyeur to hoot, to hang out with, to talk with, a conceited bighead who did something shamelessly nefarious like making millions of dollars through large-scale securities fraud and blowing it all up to satiate his drug-addiction. And yet, and yet, he's complete fun. He's reckless, he's stupid and he's funny. I haven't met anyone quite like him, certainly not in the recent spew of films and DiCaprio has never been more ebullient. He's Calvin Candie, only amped-up to several more degrees. And he comes with an swagger to match Scorsese's. Probably the best thing about ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is that it doesn't preach. You don't get to hear sermons about what's right and what's wrong, but you're watching something that tells you it's bad. Belfort's drug-fueled antics first amuse you, then disgust you. You're left to figure it out yourself, nobody tells you that. That's Scorsese's genius. He takes a look at the crimes of Wall Street in the '90s through the villain's POV but while you're having a blast like him, you're also shocked by his actions. Like him. One scene stayed with me for a long time after I had finished it. That's a lunch scene between Belfort and Mark Hanna, his boss played by a spectacularly scrupulous Matthew McConaughey, who's goading his avaricious appetite. He slips a cheeky $100 note to the waiter and instructs him to get him drinks every five minutes till he passes out. He teaches Belfort how to make it big by plummeting stocks while high on alcohol and drugs, a character so different from the one he played in ""Mud"". McConaughey deserves an Oscar nomination for this two-bit role, the ten best minutes of the movie by miles, I think. Belfort walks and talks like no one I've met, and when Hanna's company gets wrecked, he talks a geeky Donnie Azoff into joining him. Azoff is impressed by Belfort driving a Jaguar, scoffs when Belfort tells him about the money stockbrokers make and is incredulous when Belfort pops up a check to prove it. And from then on, the ride's one hell of an explosion. I've never really understood the stock game, those are spiteful, wishy-washy things that don't get to me at all. I don't understand what the hell were these guys talking about, all those damn schemes they sold on the phone while doing drugs at the same time, but I understood what Scorsese and Winter wanted me to understand - they were making a lot of money and none of it was licit. Like Belfort's character sneers bumptiously at one point, none of the audience was expected to understand any of it. It wasn't about how they did it, it was about why they did it. For three hours, the kind of gross-out depravation that unfolded on the screen sickened me. I didn't find it funny at all, not when I'm watching an abhorrent man scourge and swindle a man into financing his junkets. Or a woman getting manhandled in a drug-induced haze. It wasn't meant to be funny, it was meant to be scary. Point duly noted? If ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is an example of something, it's why Leonardo DiCaprio warrants an Oscar the Academy has owed him for over a decade. He's terrifically wild, perilously peppy and delivers his line, one after one, to comic perfection. The casting, as always in a Scorsese film, is flawless. Jonah Hill is fantastic, as are Rob Reiner and Kyle Chandler, who plays what he has been playing for the past two years. Reiner's aptly cast, much to my surprise, and he does well. Really well. Margot Robbie, as Belfort's wife, is impressive. She's got the looks and she's got the confidence. Good job handling the quivering pressure that came with the role. Jean Dujardin, who was sensational in ""The Artist"", doesn't have much to do here but whatever little he has, he does alright. Scorsese's cinema has never been more alive and it's heartening to see the master filmmaker indulging into this kind of exuberance. You won't believe a seventy-one year old has made this kind of a film, it's more like a twenty year-old made it. Dazzling.  "
139125,tt0112471,Advait Kamat,india,8,Take a tour you won't regret taking.,"There is something so endearing about ""Before Sunrise"". The story can be described in a single line and yet the film addresses immensely complex issues like parents, religion and love. It's a romance, an old-school one, shot, cut and acted with such uncanny skill that it feels like a piece out of your life. The story follows two people, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy), who meet on a train en route to Paris and decide to spend twenty-four hours walking around Vienna. In the time they spend together, they talk about all the things that made them what they are and what they could've become. When romanticizing a meeting between two strangers, one should be careful to avoid clich«∏s or risk a film that slogs. Director Richard Linklater thankfully does avoid it, because the first meeting between the two protagonists is handled with great caution. A hesitant Celine is talked into accompanying Jesse around Vienna, which Jesse later remarks that 'the coolest thing about this evening was that it was never meant to be'. There are moments like these when you know how different this particular cinematic romance is, because it feels real. The first few conversations between the characters are slightly awkward because neither of them know if they've made the right choice. Linklater handles the awkwardness, the slight embarrassment and the excitement patiently, letting his characters evolve with time. There is a masterful scene in which Jesse and Celine get inside a listening booth wherein one looks at the other and looks away when the other tries to catch his gaze. As the time passes, the characters become more and more open with one another and the conversations turn personal. In a fantastic scene in a restaurant, the two characters feign telephonic conversations with their friends, talking about their encounter and, at the same time, being honest about their attraction to each other. Apart from the performances, the writing is impeccable. The colloquial conversations are enchanting in many ways, because they are ones which we have had with someone at some point in our lives. They are biting, honest and witty, and yet, they don't lead anywhere. It's just two people talking about their point of view on things like religion, love and life but there won't be a minute where you'll get bored of it. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy are both stellar in their respective roles. Cinematographer Lee Daniel beautifully captures the narrow alleys of Vienna and makes the city look like an inconspicuous character itself. Linklater, one of the major talents of the 90s, directs with peerless virtuosity, not letting the conversations drag on for too long and successfully have his protagonists emote the right emotions at the right time, a skill which is hard to perfect and here we have someone who has managed it wonderfully in his third directorial feature. ""Before Sunrise"" is a different kind of romance, one which stays with you for a long time after it ends. It's a film to be watched because it very nearly manages to put into words some things which are otherwise impossible to do so.  "
144554,tt0107048,Advait Kamat,india,7,"Funny, innovative and Bill Murray.","Say, how many times have you wished to live a day again? Maybe when you're really happy about something, so happy, in fact, that you want to live it through all over again. Maybe a most perfect day you could imagine. ""Groundhog Day"" isn't a movie about those days. It's about a guy who relives the day of the year he despises the most. Tall order, you think, but director Harold Ramis actually gets away with it. He assembles a movie so thoughtful, so intelligent and so funny that you end up having a great time even if the idea does seem a bit far-fetched. We bump into Phil (Bill Murray), a cocky TV meteorologist who has to cover the Groundhog Day celebrations in Punxsutawney every year on February 2nd. Phil hates that part of his job. He's getting a better job, he brags at one point, so he won't have to go there again. Accompanying him on his little jaunt is Rita (Andie MacDowell), his producer, and Larry (Chris Elliott), his usual cameraman. Phil gets his weather calculations wrong on the big day and ends up being stuck in Punxsutawney after his broadcast because of a snowstorm. The next day, he wakes up to find himself living the same day over again. Initially surprised and spooked, he slowly begins to realize that he can't snap out of it unless the time loop is broken. As his frustrations quickly turn into mildly violent episodes, he begins to realize the other ways these odd circumstances could be used for. ""Groundhog Day"" begins almost lazily as Ramis spends a considerable amount of time to build the story. But as the movie progresses, it grows increasingly engaging though there is a light risk of it being repetitive since the crux of the plot is about deja vu. Once we get the gist of what is about to unfold, the flow is impossible to stop. Smoothly edited and neatly written, ""Groundhog Day"" is a well-made crowd-pleaser that delights you with its wit. Cutting a fine line between a drama and a comedy, the film never takes itself too seriously. And therein lies its strength. Ramis is aware of the goofiness of the plot but the charming characters lead you to believe otherwise. ""Groundhog Day"" misfires at times when he doesn't know what it wants to be. And that's aggravating to watch because the hesitancy translates on the screen. There were stretches of time when I had no clue what the movie eventually wanted but that niggle is rectified when it slides into a new soul later on. The movie scores with its characters. Bill Murray is nothing short of terrific, bringing the much needed zing factor into the proceedings with his enthusiastic performance that is infectious. The beautiful MacDowell has never been so endearing and she delivers a nearly flawless performance that's nicely textured. Some of the secondary actors aren't as good, I'm afraid, because they are reduced to mere caricatures. But since they don't gobble up much of the screen-time, that doesn't pose as a major problem. ""Groundhog Day"" is a charming, enjoyable fare that entertains and sermonizes in equal measure. If you're willing to overlook the minor hitches, it could be a movie that makes your day.

149764,tt1954470,Advait Kamat,india,7,Kashyap's magnum opus is effortlessly watchable.,"Gangs of Wasseypur, Anurag Kashyap's five-hour epic, is one of those films that has the potential to be in the league of Sergio Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in America"" but falls just short of true greatness. A film reminiscent of Leone's 1984 masterpiece, it spins a fictitious tale of revenge that spans through five decades of the mafia in the town of Wasseypur. The film opens in the 1940s, where Shahid Khan (Jaideep Ahlawat), a worker in the coal mines of Ramadhir Singh (Timangshu Dhulia), is shot to death by his boss when Singh overhears him telling his son of his ambition to take over the coal mines. His son, Sardar Khan (Manoj Bajpai), grows up harboring a deep sense of hatred to Singh and decides to avenge the death of his father. Along with his prot«∏g«∏s Nasir (Piyush Mishra) and Asghar (Jameel Khan), he slowly begins to take over Wasseypur by first taking over the petrol pumps and selling petrol and then moving on to the coal mines of Singh. Singh, who by now is well aware who Sardar Khan is and what his intentions are, employs Sultan (Pankaj Tripathi) to eliminate Sardar Khan and slow him down. Danish (Vineet Singh), Sardar's first son, gets injured in the first attempt to eliminate Sardar. This compels Sardar to publicly insult and shame Singh. On the second attempt though, Sardar Khan gets gravely injured and eventually dies, thus making way for a blood-letting spree to grip Wasseypur. The second part focuses on the rise of Faisal Khan and his eventual redemption after the death of his elder brother. The first part of this crime saga is funny and frustrating at the same time. The second part is a lot better than the first one although it shares a common theme of vengeance and bloodshed. Kashyap's portrayal of Wasseypur is that of a town where blood spills at every corner and bullets are fired at the slightest provocation. The opening sequence, masterfully directed, is a miniature of the whole movie. Most of the first half is an introduction to the town of Wasseypur and what started the greed and ambitions of its wily local gangsters. Most of the setting, including the clothing and the lingo, remains faithful to the rural areas of the state. The screenplay is imaginative and the dialog is colorful, superbly capturing the small-town lingo with the easy humor and the heavy dose of expletives during conversations. Rajeev Ravi's loyal camera snags the breathless action at just the right time and the film is a visual treat with the exquisitely shot lanes and landscapes of the town, thereby creating a world within a world with apparent ease. Kashyap directs superbly, with a continuously moving camera, he laces the film's most violent sequences with unexpected humor, which greatly helps in building the required amount of suspense. Of the performances, Bajpai, who gave us one of the great elemental performances in the history of Indian cinema in Ram Gopal Varma's 1998 gem ""Satya,"" is sensational in the role of Sardar Khan. He portrays Sardar as an overgrown child with a cool swagger who fears his wife although he's the most powerful chap in Wasseypur. He may have already snagged a few nominations for his performance. Siddiqui, who is nothing short of terrific, plays his youngest son in perhaps the best performance of the year. The character of Faisal is immensely complex but Siddiqui plays it easily, nailing the rapid, witty conversations with his love interest Mohsina, played by Huma Qureshi, and the calm and arrogant conversations with his detractors. He's a live-wire. ""Gangs of Wasseypur,"" though terrific, is a deeply flawed film. The runtime, which exceeds 320 minutes, could've been cut short drastically, which would've eventually resulted into the film being some kind of a masterpiece. Kashyap tackles each sub-plot with the dedication a filmmaker usually gives to the main plot, which makes the film look like a number of short films strung together using a common theme of vengeance. A considerable amount of screen time is given to the romantic sub-plots which temporarily leaves the main plot cowering for screen space. Also, the film later splits at the seam because the number of characters it employs is too many. I lost track of how some of the characters is related either to the protagonist or the antagonist. The web of guesswork is a tad easier in the second part because the film examines the relations between the main characters unlike the first part in which most of the characters and situations were introduced. ""Gangs of Wasseypur"" works mostly, partly because it employs a stellar cast and partly because the makers are well aware of their ambitions though they let the plot take shape at its own pace. I'll go out on a limb and say that the first half of the second part is one of the best 90 minutes I've seen in recent gangster flicks. The biggest issue I have with this film is that it contains too many stories which it tries to tell all at once and though some clobber you with their ingenuity, the others fall flat. The film does tend to get a bit exhausting when it reaches its climax, but overall, it's one effort that has caught our attention completely. And for that one reason, I would recommend this film to anyone who relishes the new phase of the old-fashioned Indian gangster films.  "

I had never heard of it. I found a trailer for it online and begged my dad to buy it for me on my birthday (I would have got it sooner if I had the money). I watched it that night and once the ending credits rolled I was shocked, then amazed. THIS WAS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! Well, it more of a work of art than a movie. Anyway the point Im getting to is that everyone I knew at school had never hear of Apocalypse Now! which I think is a real shame. I think our genertaion needs to see this masterpiece. I saw it and it changed my life. Now a movie that powerful should be more well knowen. At least I think so.  "

I had no expectations starting watching this movie on Netflix. It captivated me from the start and I knew I would enjoy it and I did. In fact, today I watched it for the second time. It also came in the right time for me, when I really needed uplifting, a different prospective on life. It shows that joy doesn't come with material possessions, that there are so many things we just take for granted and forget to appreciate ""what is"". The look on Driss's face when he sees ""his"" bathroom worth a thousand words. There is nothing fake in this movie. The other movies that I can compare to this one (in quality) are: Sidewalls(Argentinian 2011), The Hedgehog (French);Biutiful(Mexico); Top of the Lake series (Australian); Last Ride (Australian); The Polish bride (Dutch); The KId with a bike (Belgian);The Return (Russian).

119784,tt2488496,AdventureWolf,australia,9,A welcome return to fun for the Star Wars saga!,"It took me two viewings to really decide how I felt about this one - having been a Star Wars fan since Empire, and having been so totally caught up in the year long hype for this, my first viewing was almost surreal. The second? It all came together and I had a great time. I'm not going to comment on whether or not this is a legitimately great movie, but I will say that I love it. I find it fun, action packed, intriguing and it absolutely satisfied my Star Wars itch and is (in my opinion) a worthy successor to the original trilogy. The new characters were lots of fun and I'm looking forward to seeing them develop - especially Rey! There were lots of moments that had me wanting to fist pump, several that had goosebumps rising on my arms and lots where I was grinning like a Cheshire cat - Poe and Finn's escape, the first flight of the Millennium Falcon, the attack on Takodana, the final battle between Kylo and Rey... Both me and my family enjoyed every second of this, with my 10 and 12 years old sons both being amazed at the running time because ""it felt like just an hour!"" This movie was everything I wanted from a new Star Wars film - it was familiar enough to be nostalgic, but new enough to be a continuation. It was mature enough to not fall into the trap of the prequels, but had enough humor to lighten scenes. It answered lots of questions and also raised some great new ones - leaving me wanting more. But, most of all, it's fun and like the Flash Gordon reels that George Lucas has stated inspired him to write Star Wars in the first place it was a rollocking adventure that didn't take itself too seriously and dished out exactly what the majority of the audience wanted - thrills, spills, laughs and action. Gone are the tedious politics, gone is the annoying slapstick and back is a full throttle space adventure. Awesome!  "
103286,tt0083658,advertivo,spain,10,This is not a movie.,"This is not a movie. This is the birth of a new generation. With this, you don't need much more movies to say something interesting about cinema. Its lyrical power, the visual, auditive, and dreamable impact is huge. This is one of those few times in which you don't know what do you like the most: the book or the film. Without Philip Dick this beautiful dark universe would have never been created. I missed only a few things in the movie. One of these is the J.R.Isidore (J.F.Sebastian) live-dreams full of kipple. Another one is Mercerism and that parallel universe in which every one is involved. TIP: When you see a 90's or 00's sci-fi film, just count with your fingers the replicant scenes, i mean the scenes stolen from Blade runner. Probably you'll need the fingers of your feet. TIP FOR THE NEW PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS: Please try to be at the Blade Runner level, but not only copying it. Instead of that, generate new visual ideas in the same way they did with this movie.

The only thing that prevents it from being God in-film-ate is that the length leaves the viewer craving more. As a white person, I can say to all of you that Wes's direction in this movie is at its finest. Don't be fooled by the overstated appearance of the characters and the sets, the classy and pompous sheen is an ironic statement - the plot and moral (if you can call it that) is very true and has a universal appeal to people of all walks of life.

Has anyone noticed how every big budget movie has a very high rating that gradually dwindles down? That includes this one too. I remember when it was released the rating showed over 9.0 - which tells us the movie is outstanding. Same thing happened with the new ""Batman"". What happens is, people check the ratings and if the movie is praised then it's worth going to theater. Wrong! Someone is controlling this and fooling us. Same with this movie. If it was an action flick outside and not connected to ""Star Wars"" franchise I would give it solid ""8"". But since it's a continuation of a cult franchise and so poorly and Hollywood-like made I have to give it ""5"". The visuals and sound were outstanding. Story and actors selection - very poor. How come Rey can beat Kylo without Jedi training, not to mention Finn who can wield the light saber like he was trained. Remember how long Yoda had to train Luke before he was even able to use it...? I found Finn character very annoying as well as the super pilot who seems immortal. Kylo was alright and his voice was cool too. BB-8 was also cool. Overall, major disappointment.  "
76799,tt0211915,Adwood29,united states,7,"The mysterious and unpredictable ""Zoro"" - Am«∏lie","Le fabuleux destin d'Am«∏lie Poulain known simply as Am«∏lie in English is a wonderful and sprite full story about a young woman named Am«∏lie who is on a mission to bring happiness to people's lives and find her true love. As the title suggests it is the ""fabulous destiny"" of Am«∏lie but is it really destiny? I believe that it wasn't her destiny rather her way of trying to play ""hard to get"". Throughout the movie Am«∏lie leaves clues that allow this man that she loves find her and make him love her by the little things that she does. She is making him work to find her and along the way solving the little mysteries that he wanted to discover. For example, the bald man that kept appearing up in his photo album and no one knew who he was. When Am«∏lie broke the photo booth on purpose she led her love there and he found out that the mystery man was just the maintenance man. The face that her love expressed was priceless and although he didn't know who Am«∏lie was he knew it was her. In my opinion this movie was a little hard to understand and was a little out of my taste. I know that this is a ""foreign"" movie but I still prefer the big name Hollywood productions. Now don't get my wrong this was a good movie it just wasn't for me. I think that people who are looking for a light hearted romantic comedy movie should defiantly watch this movie. It has the right amount of comedy in it to not make you lose track of the love story but just enough to give you that comedy relief that you need during an uncomfortable scene or long love scene. I also think this is a good movie to watch if you are looking for something a little different. You will never find another movie like this in Hollywood. After I watched this movie it opened me up to another side of film and cinematography. The way that this film was producer is like nothing I have seen in a movie produced in a Hollywood film. The way they used animations as if it were a fairy tale was very unreal to me and at first thought it was kind of silly. Near the end though it seamed to have a great impact on the movie. It allowed me to realize you don't need to centralize a specific technique to one genre. If you are good enough you could make it work in any movie. Overall it was a great film that obviously took a lot of time and practice and helped me open my eyes and mind to give these ""foreign"" films a shot. - Adam  "
43711,tt0816692,adwright100-31-166862,united kingdom,8,"Bends space-time, narrative & your mind","Imagine Gravity and 2001 - A Space Odyssey had a baby; they'd name it Interstellar. With the production values of both and with science and nature not fantasy-magic driving the awe and wonder Interstellar leaves a long, lingering taste in your head. Matthew McConaughey plays ex-NASA pilot turned farmer in some recognisably normal version of the Earth's future. We're just a few years ahead of our now and terrible climatic change is wreaking havoc with our ability to produce enough food. America is pedalling backwards, people are returning to the land in a desperate attempt to grow enough food but it is clear we are in the end of days of the human race. Cooper (McConaughey's character) is a widower, raising a teenage son and daughter. The daughter, Murphy, is intellectually gifted and in the early part of the narrative experiences poltergeist-type activity in her bedroom; things gets broken, books get pushed off shelves, strange lines appear on the floor when dust from a storm swills into her room. These lines turn out to be a simple binary code, co-ordinates of a secret NASA facility which Cooper sets off one night to investigate. Enter Michael Caine and NASA's skeleton crew, the once great and good space agency reduced to skulking in a mountain-side because public opinion, with the Earth going to hell in a hand-cart, not supportive of grand spending on the so-called folly of space exploration. Michael Caine's character, a gifted physicist called Professor Brand who Cooper knows from when he worked for NASA, has a grand vision for the future of humanity. He also has some of the best lines, several of which turn up in the trailers. You'll know the one I mean; ""Mankind was born on Earth, we were never meant to die here."" Having discovered this mission to save the Earth Cooper learns of a stable worm-hole that has appeared in the orbit of Saturn which offers humans the opportunity to travel in interstellar space to search out a new home. His mission with a team of other astronauts, one of which is Professor Brand's daughter (played by Anne Hathaway), is to travel through the worm-hole to connect up with several pioneer missions that have already journeyed interstellar. NASA has lost contact with them though. Enough plot to get you started I think, anymore begins to damage the sheer joy and wonder of a beautifully constructed story. Interstellar is science-fiction rooted deeply in science fact, it represents Einstein's relativity in narrative form, showing fascinatingly the time-bending qualities of dense gravitational fields. We have a black hole, a singularity and theories of everything. Interstellar bends narrative, back upon itself - lose not sight of that poltergeist - as well as space-time (as relativity predicts) along with our minds. Great story, great performances and cinema as it should be. Space is experienced as deadly, beautiful and silent. The forces that shape our Universe are portrayed superbly and the ridiculously puny nature of our lives is writ large. Interstellar is definitely the best rendition of theoretical physics on the big screen, a physicist, Kip Thorne was on board as a consultant and producer. It's been generally well-received by critics and justifiably so. It would be my film of the year so far. Story, script and science beautifully intermingled and not an alien in sight. The one sour note in the reviews was Peter Bradshaw's in the Guardian. I love the Guardian but it does have on the payroll a cast of intellectual-snobs whose main role in life seems to be to sneer and whine. Bradshaw's reviews fails utterly in two respects, one it contains too many spoilers not to destroy the experience of the story (so don't read it here if you haven't seen the film yet) and secondly it fails utterly to get the great big gravitational twist at the end (perhaps Mr Bradshaw isn't quite as intellectual a snob as he thinks he is, which might just leave him being a snob!) Three stars Mr Bradshaw does enable you to deliver your normal sneery review but doesn't reflect at all the popularisation of relativity and the beauty of space and science Interstellar makes real on the big screen. Mark Kermode in the Guardian also whines a bit, hey perhaps it's in the contract for journalists joining the paper, talking about plot-holes. The only holes I could spot were worm and black ones, along, of course, with the big one we are digging ourselves as we destroy our ecosystem's ability to support us. Interstellar is epic cinema as its best and it will inspire many people, young and old, to journey deep and long and wide into the wonders of science fact and fiction. **** (Four Stars)  "
67085,tt1345836,Ady F,united kingdom,10,Absolute Batman,"I had the delightful experience of watching the Batman trilogy at the BFI IMAX cinema in London, on the day of it's UK release. First of all, I'm so glad that Christopher Nolan chose to shoot in IMAX and not 3D. I'm not a '3D' fan and this would have killed the movie. I admire Chris Nolan for doing what he wanted and not just jumping on the bandwagon. IMAX definitely enhanced the films overall. The scenes that were shot with IMAX cameras, totally filled the 26mx20m silver screen and I felt fully immersed in the story. Ultra high definition and true depth of field certainly made this an experience to remember. I doubt I will ever enjoy normal cinemas as much. I'm a massive Batman fan. I loved the cartoons when I was younger and had all the toys. I still read the comics now and Batman is in fact the only comic I read. The characters are so complex and interesting, that I have no need to read any other comics nor the time. I understand the great depth of each character and it is clear that Christopher Nolan also shares this knowledge. I was disappointed by the Original Batman Movies and as a fan, I felt let down. In my eyes, the Batman films were forever dead. Memento is one of my favourite films, so when it was announced that Christopher Nolan was making Batman Begins, I started to believe that Batman would finally get the screen time and a decent story that he deserved, although I was still sceptical. Thankfully the first film exceeded expectations and the ending made me very anxious to see the next film. Batman was dark and mysterious, just like he was meant to be. My favourite Batman character is of course the Joker and the second Christopher Nolan film, The Dark Knight, ticked every single box. Christopher Nolan and Heath Ledger both had a great vision and created the perfect Joker. The character was so complex and was depicted exactly how he was in some of my favourite Batman comics. After watching The Prestige and Inception, Christopher Nolan soon became my favourite Director of all time. He consistently surpasses my expectations and is such a creative and talented Director. Despite rumours that he wouldn't come back to make a third Batman movie, I believed that he would want to make the perfect ending to the perfect beginning of a famous icon. Thus The Dark Knight Rises was announced. Despite the opinions and bad reviews the title for this new film received, I personally thought it made sense and fitted well within the Nolan story arc. I saw many rumours of whom was being cast for the new film, including Johnny Depp as the Riddler. This was entertaining to read and exciting. As soon as Tom Hardy was confirmed as Bane, I started researching the Actor as I had only seen him in Inception. After watching Layer Cake and Rock'n'Rolla again, Bronson, The Take and Warrior, I realised how talented an Actor Tom Hardy is and soon became a big fan of his too. I had every faith that Christopher Nolan had picked the perfect actor to play such a fantastic and iconic Batman villain, despite what others were saying. I spent the following year looking forward to the next and final instalment of Nolan's Batman franchise. Leading up to the release, everyone had high expectations of this film due to the success from its predecessor. Many believed it would not be as good because Heath Ledger was not in it. I had my own expectations and was anxious but I believed in Christopher Nolan. I'm happy to say that this final film, was a complete success in my eyes. It successfully connected the dots from the previous films and gave a fantastic ending that was true to Batman, as well as keeping with Nolan's signature story-telling and vision. I totally got what Nolan was trying to achieve and could only wish that I could have the opportunity to work with such a talented person. The story was interesting throughout and had many references to some of my favourite comics, as did the previous two films. The sound and music was ear-popping and exactly how it should be. Seeing this at the IMAX really helped enhance the experience. All actors were fantastic and played the characters perfectly. Christian Bale once again portrayed Batman in a way that is true to character. Anne Hathaway went beyond my expectations for her role as Catwoman. Tom Hardy continued to strengthen his talents. His eyes are piercing and demonstrate so much emotion without the need to see his face. Very few great actors can do that. Bane was realistic and certainly on par with Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker. Despite what others think, I believe that the audio for his voice was perfectly clear and understandable. I look forward to seeing Hardy as Mad Max. As far as the story goes. It lives up to what has already happened in Gotham City and goes beyond this. It has its twists and turns, as well as its puzzles and complexities, like all Nolan films. I understood the ending and have my own interpretation of it, just like Nolan expects. Some people may not like this film and may feel let down because it is not how they expected it to be. At the end of the day, if you think you can do better, good luck to you. As a genuine Batman and Christopher Nolan fan, I am entirely satisfied with this film. May the people that tragically lost their lives to this film rest in peace now. My thoughts are with their friends and families. I hope that one day, they will be able to watch this film and appreciate it for what it is, without being reminded of the horrible events that occurred.  "
110186,tt1205489,adytumatlast,united states,1,meh,"I've scored this movie as a 1 to help remove it from the top 250 as well as decrease its average. This decision is based upon the quality of the movie, which is mediocre at best. If you've seen this movie and enjoyed it, the only way I can offer a bit of enlightenment is to encourage you to listen to any real-life conversation that is taking place between any two people at any time anywhere in the world, and then compare it to the dialogue in Gran Torino. I think you will find in hindsight that word choice, the pacing, and the delivery come off as stilted, over-played, and clich«∏d in a manner which would make ""Crash"" blush. As seems to be true of contemporary society, this script is out of touch with its characters' voices and makes up for this absence of authenticity by exaggerating obvious stereotypes, such as the brooding vet, the snarky girl, etc. Clint would do well to relax a bit and let the voices of these characters evolve a bit more, rather than relying on these rather easy character devices. Additionally--and I'll be brief here, because other users have covered this more thoroughly than I--the mere identification of racism is not in itself a commentary on racism; it is an opportunity to construct a story around racial themes which will illuminate different modes of thinking or behaving. In Gran Torino, Clint's overuse of racial slurs--from beginning to end--left little opportunity for racism to operate as a critical or thoughtful theme. In the end, as in the case of Crash, the racism theme was overplayed--obvious to the point of obnoxiousness, and reflective of an industry whose conception of human interactions is not evidenced by reality.

118821,tt2488496,Aearion,germany,9,A great movie for the whole family!,"I read a lot of reviews here and now I've seen this movie, too. I wonder what people, who complain about this movie, did expect. Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? Schindler's List? The Force Awakens (TFA) is a fairy tale, a science fiction comic, so, things in this universe work a little bit different than on earth. I suggest, if you don't like movies in popcorn style then simply don't watch them and watch serious movies instead. I think I have to correct some things a lot of people complained about. So, lean back and enjoy *** THE SPOILERS THAT ARE ABOUT TO COME NOW! ****** 1. Rey. People complain about her flying the Falcon in a such experienced way. That's because she is extremely skilled and gifted. That is the story TFA tells us. And yes, that is not G«¨nter Grass style. People complain, that she is almost beating Keylo in the lightsaber duel. Well, I must have seen a different fight, because what I saw was Rey barely able to defense herself. But Keylo is a lame duck and the longer this fight lasts the weaker he gets. He has absolutely no self-confidence and is scary and Rey has to fight for her life. I think the result is realistic in the Star Wars universe. 2. Keylo. As already mentioned Ben Solo is a goofy Darth Vader wannabe and as a result he wears this senseless mask. That is the very story. He wants to be like Vader so bad that he decided to wear this mask because Vader has worn a mask too. That's all. Nothing to complain about. And his tantrums a similar to the ones Vader had in Episode 4-6. Remember all the poor guys he killed after getting bad news or when things didn't go as he expected. Adam Driver did a really good work here! 3. Han Solo. Dying in this way is not a disgrace. He loved his son and wanted to save him. Han Solo is that kind of guy who thinks he succeeds when he really wants it. He believed he could save his son and was sacrificed for that. Sad, but I buy it. I would have preferred more movies with Han Solo but if Harrison Ford doesn't want to play Solo any more we have to deal with it, I think. 4. Luke. We only see him in the last 30 seconds of the movie and that isn't a bad idea because TFA is the first movie in a trilogy, so Luke will be more apparent in the next movies. After all the Resistance succeeded because they destroyed the Starkiller and found Luke. Happy ending for now. More to come. The scene with Luke just looks epic, BTW. 5. Protagonists are so young. As already mentioned this is a movie also for children and teenagers. And in order to give them the chance to identify with the heroes, the hero-protagonists shouldn't be 55 years old but in their twenties. Rey, Finn and Keylo are symbols for the children and teenagers who are watching this movie. Leia, Han Solo and Maz Kanata are like parents or grandparents. This is the way family-movies work, I think. After all, there are two things that I didn't like when watching: 1. Why is R2D2 sleeping and with no reason suddenly awaking? That makes no sense even in the Star Wars universe. What about getting the second map but it's encrypted? R2D2 has to decrypt it and for my sake this could last years. But a hibernating R2D2 is senseless in my opinion. 2. In the snow Rey wears the same thin clothes she has already worn on the hot desert planet. This is a big mistake. Even Chewbacca was freezing. How could this mistake happen? 3. The Goebbels-like speech was embarrassing. And then all the soldiers raised their hands. OMG! Summary: TFA is a great movie for the whole family. The visuals are perfect, there is no battle-overload and the protagonists have enough depth for this kind of story. The acting is appropriate. John Williams' score is a little bit flavorless but it's Williams. :-) If you like Gohstbusters, Finding Nemo and other stuff like that you will enjoy TFA. And please don't compare it with Episode 4-6, because you were a child/teenager when you watched this. The magic is gone, you won't experience it again in this way.  "
55696,tt0209144,aearly-02191,united states,10,Excellent,"Easily my favorite film directed by Christopher Nolan, who is never disappointing. Leonard Shelby is left brain damaged after an attempt to fight the man to who killed his wife. Leonard is stuck with Retrograde Amnesia, in which he can't form any new memories since the incident. Leonard is determined to find his wife's killer, but the investigation is tough with his handicap, so he tattoos himself, takes pictures, and keeps notes to remind himself of his purpose everyday. Memento is suspenseful, thrilling, intense, and highly intellectual. Nolan presents the film in reverse, and it is as confusing as it sounds. As viewers, we see the clues and scenes just as Leonard would, without context, memory and quite a bit of confusion in 15 minute increments. Nolan does an excellent job letting viewers see the world as Leonard would, experiencing the frustration of memory loss. This movie sucks you in from very beginning, and forces you to pay close attention; you have to focus in order to catch the clues and play the detective. In the very fist scene you see Leonard murder his friend Teddy, which leaves you questioning everything within the first few minutes. It's exciting and mind-blowing. A movie that forces you to question your beliefs once you can make sense of it all. I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes a good brain teaser. And just as a warning, you may have to watch it more than once.  "

94857,tt0372784,AEBarschall,united states,5,A lot of racing around,"I mostly wanted to see this movie because I wanted to see Katie Holmes, since I've never seen her before. She was very beautiful and pretty convincing in her role, though not enormously so. I don't think she's one of our top actresses, but she isn't terrible either. I thought the guy who played Batman wasn't very good looking. He has this peculiar, overly narrow nose & flattish face. Why him? His acting was pretty good, though. There was an awful lot of racing around in the movie, particularly in the bat-mobile. I found watching this a bit fatiguing. There were some positive parts of the movie. I particularly liked the guy who played the only executive at Wayne's company who is actually loyal to him. I also liked the Ninja training scenes. Overall it wasn't abysmal, but I don't know if it was the best way to spend a couple of hours of my time.  "
106299,tt0268978,AEBarschall,united states,10,Fabulous!," I went because a colleague, who is not a particularly young colleague either, told me that this was quite possibly the best movie she had ever seen in her life. It certainly was excellent. If it did happen to be the one movie you ever got to see, it would not be a bad choice. It has intellectual stimulation, suspense, love, surprises, humor, and great acting. It never drags, and is always convincing. One thing I appreciated about it was that I did not feel over-stimulated. Sometimes I think Hollywood just tries too hard to make you go ""wow!"" Instead, this movie chose to take on the pace and character of reality. It was like floating along on the river of this man's life. Russel Crowe was the height of the movie -- not the least of the performance was an Australian doing a West Virginia accent, which I thought he pulled off most credibly, at least most of the time. The woman playing the wife was not as good, though exceptionally beautiful, which is not a bad thing in a movie. Also the man playing the roommate was very good. I didn't realize that Ron Howard, whom I can never stop thinking of as Opie, was the director until the closing credits. Well little Opie grew up and done good! It's funny how I almost feel like he was a childhood friend, albeit from a different state. I have read that in some ""primitive"" societies, schizophrenics are treated quite differently from here. They can be regarded as religious mystics and are encouraged to talk about their visions. Some people think that this treatment actually works better than what we do. This movie certainly makes one wonder whether that might not be true.   "
117211,tt2488496,aeberry-98063,united states,1,Disappointing to say the least,"I honestly CANNOT believe that this movie has a current rating of 8.6 That is absolutely ridiculous. I created an account to review this movie because I felt so strongly about how trashy it was. 1. How can anyone get over the fact that J.J. Abrams completely threw away Star Wars rules? I guess the rules don't apply to Rey and she can just use the force when she pleases with no training whatsoever. I'm so sick of Hollywood ruining story lines and characters just to be politically ""correct."" Rey is not superwoman. She is an (emotional) teenage girl who was handed things and skills because she struggled early on. Such a predictable and annoying character. 2. Finn is useless. He is only there for comic relief which is unnecessary. He seems out of place in the movie and has no depth to him whatsoever. He doesn't want to be a storm trooper? Cool. Why? ""Because it's the right thing to do."" What made him think this way? That might have made the story more interesting. Instead we're given a bland sidekick with dry humor. 3. Oh, the humor. Disney how you baby us. Did we really need such childish humor throughout the movie? For example, when Rey is bound by Kylo Ren, she (somehow, with no training) uses the force to compel the storm trooper standing guard. The guard repeats what she says and undoes her constraints and beings to walk away. Ren quickly adds ""and you will drop your weapon."" The trooper replies ""And I will drop my weapon."" What???? Was that needed. If he had just dropped his weapon that would have been fine but instead Disney had to dumb it down for us. 4. Kylo Ren is the absolute worst villain I have ever had the displeasure of encountering. People who are saying he is conflicted are so daft. He is poorly written and the most bratty bad guy ever. He throws a literal temper tantrum when things don't go his way. He worships Vader, his dead grandfather, for no reason at all. He says that he is pulled by the light (the light side doesn't pull you, only the dark does) but this is not a constant battle. He easily overcomes it and moves back to throwing temper tantrums. He wears a mask for, again, no reason at all. To all who are saying Hans death was so emotional and dramatic, WHAT? How could you not see that coming? Kylo was never conflicted, you knew he was going to kill his father from the moment the scene began. 5. I know Harrison Ford said he would only do the movie if his character died, but he looked like he wanted to die the whole time. Hans is this awesome, strong, witty, intelligent man. The Hans we saw looked tired and bored. Nothing against Harrison Ford, I'm sure he was given little to work with. Freaking Rey knew his ship better than he did for, again, no reason at all. 6. Hans and Leia's relationship was so awkward and a total let down. We have been rooting for them for 30 years now and this is what we were given?? Two adults who seem uncomfortable with each other and who refer to their son as ""our son"" and that's it. Also, Leia barely cries when Hans dies. So disappointing. 7. Lastly, (well, I could write 100 pages on my disappointment, but I've written too much already) like everyone has said, this is a replica of A New Hope. No originality whatsoever. The graphics were good and the plot could have been interesting had they introduced Mark Hamill sooner. I can't say many more positive things about this movie. I am so sad and disappointed in this movie and J.J Abrams. A complete letdown. Also, whoever is REALLY reviewing this so positively...why? How can you be so stupid? I hope the ratings go down so this film lands where it deserves- in the trash.  "
60829,tt0043014,aeboynton,united states,7,Sunset Blvd.,"Norma Desmend, played by Gloria Swanson did an amazing job at portraying a mentally imbalanced person who dreams of returning to her previous life as a silent movie star. Joe gills, played by William Holden seems to be disconnected to Norma in that he lives with her and pretends to be there to write a movie script in which she is the star. The themes in this movie are still relevant issues today and that's one of the reasons I believe that this movie is considered timeless. Norma still yearns for the attention that being a movie star brings. She is holding onto her past life and therefore cannot move forward in any other aspect of her being. The movie did make me laugh in parts, at times because of Norma's disillusionment however at the end I just felt sorry for her. Like many people in Hollywood today, their acting careers fizzle out at a certain age unless they reinvent themselves significantly. This often is the case with child stars that then turn to acquire psychological issues or addictions to drugs or alcohol. I also think it is quit sad that her butler and ex husband still lives with her because he loves her. It seems like in this each character is not living but existing in their life. I think it would add a greater dimension to the film if the audience knew a bit more about max as her ex husband and the history of them.  "
79671,tt0075314,aeboynton,united states,9,Taxi Driver,"This movie showed the damage that being a Vietnam War vet does psychologically (PTSD) and how that affects the rest of this mans life. Robert Deniro was excellent in this roll playing Travis, a Vietnam vet. His character was very well developed and we saw how each part of his life was so affected by his experiences in war. Jodie foster, who plays a 12-year-old prostitute, is trying to be saved by Travis. Travis feels that New York City is full of scum. He see's the violence and corruption in the city during his job and wants to help Jodie Foster's character (Iris) escape her pimp. His own insanity and loneliness causes Travis to lose a connection with people and it is his mission to help Iris. I think that this movie exposed people to the corruption and ""scum"" in New York City at the time. I also felt in some way that it sent an anti-war message to the public. However, this movie also gave people a sense of what war vets go through mentally even after they're home. Sometimes the psychological damage is greater than a physical injury.  "

It adds drama and creates a more violent story line. There was symbolism in the life of the police woman versus her job. she seemed able to to separate her personal emotions from the crime and bloodshed, however in the end we see that it does finally effect her. This movie also shows how things in life cannot be planned and life has a way of not following the original path one sets out. I think this movie was trying to emphasize that life is short and unpredictable and we have to make the most of the simple pleasures and people in our lives.  "
128882,tt1130884,aedesjanus,united states,6,Hall of Endless Mirrors and Little Else,"Scorcese at 67. Obviously it needs to be full, luxurious, and each moment complete. No part of the film should disappoint, or elude the control or presence of the auteur. In consequence, each scene is carefully played out to satisfy the intent of the director, while he remains motionless. Although Shutter Island uses the dependable trope of cherchez la femme, a more appropriate focus would be the search for the r«∏alisiteur. This is not to be confused with a lack of directing. The film is so over-directed that it ceases to be just that. And the film unwittingly deconstructs this very theme. Leonardo DiCaprio, plays Teddy Daniels, a United States marshal taking a ferry ride out to the island to investigate the disappearance of a patient in 1952. Like gangs of New York, the production design cannot be outdone, and thus lacks the spark of imaginative interpretation. There is no leap of faith required to believe in the environment created. What it makes up for in authority of voice, it loses for being lifeless and imperial. Like the experience of a theme park, every character we meet is to be no more and no less than we expect. No character should break out because it cannot conform to the role. We watch DiCaprio playing the role of a man on a search in a flawlessly constructed historical «¨ber-reality. At no point do we stop seeing DiCaprio playing this role, and being the actor he is, we go along with it. At no moment do we actually feel like the constructed environment is anything but that. The film unfolds with increasing use of overly mannered genre fragments from thrillers and horror films, including a sound track that gives the literal interpretation of the visual dimension an updated definition. This only gets past us because we are in a fascinating theme park with a mesmerizing tour guide. All this schtick is supposed to provide the emotional aesthetic for DiCaprio's descent into the revelation of his insanity. But this does not reveal anything about Scorcese, DiCaprio, the period so meticulously reproduced, or any one of the particular grand themes the film nods towards. This is particularly telling in the scenes set in the liberation of Dachau. The portrayal is heavily sanitized. The piles of bodies, in civilian clothes, not starved, and covered in snow. On the one hand one could applaud the unwillingness to engage in ""KZ pornography"", yet these images deprive the victims of the horrors they endured. They are not permitted the death they experienced, because it would obviously disrupt Scorcese's meticulously framed indulgence. The film viewer shares the same fate as DiCaprio, as he struggles to find any meaning in all of this . DiCaprio's ""decision"" at the end of the movie to retain his madness, at the expense of a lobotomy, underscores this. He sacrifices his ability, and the burden, to adjudicate ambivalence and substance in order to formally assert his right to illusion. And by analogy, Scorcese affirms his own right to indulge his parallel reality, independent of what substance it may have for anyone involved. The problem is that, unlike Taxi Driver, he is not a (young) creator in search of himself in the periphery of society's failure. Shutter Island unwittingly serves as an example of how a film exemplifies the evisceration of once insightful creative indulgence, made possible only by the legacy of former successes. The film is Scorcese's largest grossing movie. This success does little more than underscore the fact that it has no real intended audience. It is a Martin Scorcese film that exhausts itself in being that. The film carries us forward in the unfolding of an exquisitely crafted conceit that is entirely harmless and ultimately meaningless. This apotheosis of form is at the core of imperial entitlement. Through it Scorcese exercises his power and agency. But this proof is only of particular interest to Scorcese and the stakeholders around him. There is no place at the table for uncontrollable elements like substance or real pain.  "

81723,tt0435761,aefrench,united states,8,Pixar does it again,"I have seen several movies that Pixar has made, and have liked every single one of them. Toy Story 3 is no exception. The story begins quite a while after Toy Story 2. Andy is now a teenager and is preparing to attend college. Woody, Buzz and the gang have been kept in the toy box, no longer getting the attention that they once did. With Andy leaving the house shortly, that is not about to change. Since Andy is no longer going to be living at home, a decision must be made about the toys. Other than Woody, the group gets put into a trash bag, with the intention that they shall be stored in the attic. As for Woody, he will be going to college with Andy. The bag containing the other toys accidentally gets sent to the curb, where the trash truck is headed. They escape and make it to the family car. Woody joins them, trying to explain to them that they were not meant to go into the trash. The toys do not believe that, and decide it's time to move on. In the middle of this argument, Andy's mom gets into the car and heads to the Sunnyside Daycare Center. After arriving at Sunnyside, the gang is greeted by the building's resident toys. The leader is Lots-O-Huggin Bear (Lotso for short), a very friendly toy. He tells the newcomers how fun Sunnyside is. Each day, the several kids who attend play with the toys nonstop. It's several hours of playtime. Buzz, Jessie, Hamm, and the others love it. After what happened with Andy, this is perfect. Woody is not content, of course. Andy is his kid, and that's all there is to it. Will the group split? Will Sunnyside become their permanent home? Is Andy going to miss them? The voice acting is great as always. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are just right as Woody and Buzz, respectively. Ned Beatty's voice is somewhat unrecognizable as Lotso. Every actor and actress is well cast. The movie has its share of funny dialogue and the sight gags are terrific. There are also references to the film's predecessors that fans of the trilogy will enjoy. I must comment on one of the new characters. That would be Ken, and he has many funny moments throughout Toy Story 3, such as when he meets Barbie, and when he models clothes for Barbie. You get a good laugh there. You'll also laugh when Buzz becomes Spanish Buzz. It leads to some great moments. Once again, Pixar delivers good entertainment. The studio really stands out at a time when movies seem to just be remakes of something else. Pixar is really about quality. Anyone can enjoy Toy Story 3. It is perfect for families. Make this one the next family movie.  "

Everyone wishes for a chance to change their lives, but how often does that happen? Well, it happens to Rocky. Rocky Balboa is a boxer who fights in local bouts in Philadelphia. To supplement his income, he takes a job collecting for a loan shark named Gazzo. Despite being involved in such a brutal sport and seedy occupation, Rocky is a decent human being. He trains at a gym owned by Mickey, who was a fighter in the 1920s. Mickey cares about Rocky, but sees him as a fighter not living up to his potential. Across the street from the gym is a pet store where a girl named Adrian works. Rocky takes a liking to Adrian, but she does not reciprocate those feelings. It's not that she dislikes Rocky, she is just very shy. Eventually, a relationship blossoms between the two. Rocky is friends with Adrian's brother Paulie, who works at a meat company. Paulie is one of those people who are just rude, and he is mean to Adrian in several scenes in the picture. Unbeknownst to Rocky, Apollo Creed, the Heavyweight Champion of the World, is looking for an opponent to fight after the original challenger pulls out of the contest due to a hand injury. The fight itself is to take place in Philadelphia on New Year's Day 1976, which signals the beginning of America's Bicentennial. After Apollo finds Rocky's name in a book of local fighters, he sees the possibilities. As a result, Rocky becomes the challenger. After accepting the offer, Rocky is paid a visit by Mickey. He explains to Rocky that this chance is a once-in-a-lifetime scenario, and he offers to become Rocky's manager. Rocky does not believe that Mickey is being sincere, since he needed Mickey's help once before and did not get it. Mickey leaves, and Rocky starts yelling at him in a rage. He catches up with Mickey moments later and the two work out their differences. After a handshake, Mickey becomes Rocky's trainer, and the two begin to prepare for the big fight. The cast deserves praise. Stallone pulls double duty as actor and writer, and succeeds on both counts. Talia Shire is good as Adrian. Carl Weathers gives a fine performance as Apollo Creed. Burt Young is well cast as Paulie, and Burgess Meredith is terrific as Mickey. John G. Avildsen, who directed ""The Karate Kid"" and ""Lean on Me,"" does a good job here. Rocky's running to the Art Museum with ""Gonna Fly Now"" playing is a scene that stays in your memory. That can be said about several lines in the film as well. I cannot say anything negative about this movie. It is well done and you should see it.  "

The strange thing is: I ve seen it again on DVD now and it - for some reason I can not explain - rather bored me. It has great actors, fantastic settings, but the story is not more than ""okay"" (it has some far-fetched useless halfhearted twists in it) and in the end one feels like having seen a teaser for Walt Disney parks ... and that s probably what the film actually is: a roller-coaster ride with some narrative lengths (it s far too long for a real exciting roller-coaster ride). Johnny Depp s acting is absolutely outstanding though (selfironical overacted, rather camp without being really gay). I also believe that Depp himself would not say that it s one of the best movies he played in (hopefully not), but probably one of the best payed jobs he s done (hopefully). Without Depp the movie would probably be quite boring and ""cheap"" (in the meaning of ""cheap tricks""), with Depp it s at least well entertaining and particularly quite funny.

50160,tt0407887,aeo,united states,1,Wow! You people are easy to please.,"I am a fan of Martin Scorsese but this movie sucks. This movie is a remake of a Hong Kong movie called ""Internal Affairs."" If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese. Why do I hate ""Departed?"" First, Scorsese was an idiot putting Jack Nicholson as the crime boss because he is going to steal the whole damn movie. Nicholson is that talented. Plus, Scorsese gave too much part to the crime boss character. He should have been a tangential character with the real crux of the movie focused on Matt Damon and Di Caprio. Second, Matt Damon's character was too one dimensional or there was no real complexity to his character. He was simply bad. In Internal Affairs, the bad cop was more complex. In that movie, you see a cop becoming annoyed by the crime boss who he sees as a threat to his future. Third, there was more violence and sex in this movie than in Internal Affairs and I love gratuitous violence and sex in a movie so long as it is done properly. Scorsese just injected more sex and violence to cover up his terrible script adaption of an excellent film. Fourth, the dialog was fine but again, it lacks intelligent discourse among the principal characters so I cannot say it was great writing. It was simply mediocre at best. Fifth, and primary reason I hate this movie is that there is no real TENSION between the characters. Oh sure, Damon character wants to kill Di Caprio and vice a versa but there has to more to this than that. In the original, there was interaction between the bad cop and good cop, but you see that the bad cop is not so truly bad and therefore, the audience is torn. What I am trying to say is that there was a subtle buildup to the real tension in that movie which makes you really appreciative of the quality of that movie as oppose to this crap. That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie. But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed. In fact, for those who decide to rent Internal Affairs, I can almost guarantee that you will like Internal Affairs much more than Departed. You will like Internal Affairs so much more that you will see what a junk Departed really is.  "
93463,tt0372784,aeo,united states,8,Captures the true spirit of Batman!,"I give this 8 out of 10! I hardly give this high score to movies but this movie deserves an 8! I have been waiting for so long for someone to make a true adaptation of my comic heroes that I literally gave up. Why is this movie so great and why should it deserve a 9? Let's look at the origins of Batman. Batman was a creation of Bob Kane who created this during the Great Depression of United States. Poverty, unemployment, and hopelessness was prevalent during this time. Using this as his backdrop, Bob Kane delivered a hero portraying the realities of the time. The character appealed to readers because Batman had no special powers like Superman who appealed to the fantasy side of people. Batman was realistic. He was simply a man with conviction to do justice against criminals. This is what Batman was about. During the 1960's, Batman appeared on TV as a children's show so Batman and his villains were made with comedic features and simple dialog. None of the realism of Batman ever materialized. During the 1960's, 1970's, and the first half of 1980's, the general sales of comic books were on the decline, especially older characters like Batman. Batman comics mirrored the TV series by writing fluffy stories, thereby losing even more readers. However, good stories would appear now and then such as the arch villain Ra's Al Ghul in 1971. In 1986, a highly talented Frank Miller took hold of the Batman series and created a fantagraphic story it called ""The Dark Knight Returns."" I remember purchasing this big bound book, which was very expensive, and just simply awe struck at the character development, story, and the art. He brought back the spirit of Batman again. It was truly a momentous moment because this fantagraphic novel brought back interest in Batman and Hollywood took notice of it. However, Hollywood never truly appreciated the character that was Batman and would create a trio of disappointing adaptation of Batman on the big screen. In 1989, Tim Burton was the director of Batman, the story by Sam Hamm, screenplay by Sam Hamm and Warren Skaaren. The director, the story, and the screenplay all failed. Tim Burton tried to mesh the 1960's Batman series with the spirit of the original Batman comic series but failed. I like Michael Keaton and I think he is a great actor but he should have not been cast as Batman and Kim Basinger was simply annoying. The only thing that saved that movie was Jack Nicholson as the Joker. In 1992, in Batman Returns, Tim Burton directs and the story is co-written by Daniel Waters and Sam Hamm, and screenplay is by Daniel Waters. Again it failed for the same reason above. However, there was a bit more substance into the movie with the story about the origins of Penguin but it was done so humorously that I simply could not get into the character. I mean, the scene where the Penguin, played by Danny De Vito dies and these giant penguins take his body away was so hilarious that I just laughed and shook my head in disbelief. The only thing I liked in this film was Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman. In 1995, Tim Burton is no longer directing (thank god) but now you have Joel Schumacher who is even worse! Story is by Lee Batchler and Janet Scott Batchler. Screenplay by Lee Batchler and Janet Scott Batchler and Akiva Goldsman. You had more people working on the story and it sucked, and this time it sucked big time! Val Kilmer played Batman! Oh my god, give me a break! I think he is a talented actor but bad casting. The studio must have known that this movie sucked because they just threw in all big name stars at the time and hoped that movie goers will not pay attention to the substance of this crappy movie! In 2005, when I heard Hollywood was going to do another Batman movie, needless to say, I was highly skeptical and quite cynical given its past three movies which were all crap. That is the reason why I did not go and see the movie immediately but rather waited to see the reviews. I was surprised at the highly positive reaction of the movie critics and general movie viewers but I was still skeptical and waited until this weekend to this movie. Whenever there is an adaptation from a book, comic book, video games or whatever to the movie screen, literal adaptation usually does not work. I was curious as I sat in the movie seat on how many thing they would change Batman in this movie. First of all---WOW! What a fantastic movie! It really captured the spirit of Batman! There were some things I would have changed but this is as close to nirvana for someone who has been a Batman aficionado for a long time. No fluff, no inane story or dialog; only hard-edged-gritty story. Exactly what Batman is meant to be. I liked Christian Bale as Batman. He did not come off as cocky as Val Kilmer or as stilted as Michael Keaton. Katie Holmes was also good as an ancillary figure. She was not annoying like Kim Basinger. I was worried when I saw so many movie stars in the movie because that means the story would suck but I was totally wrong. No one star upstage the true star of this movie---Batman. I knew that the movie would change things but I was surprised that Ra's Al Ghul was portrayed as a good guy and that the young Bruce Wayne would go off to find himself for 7 years. Surprisingly though, it all worked. If you can make me like this movie, a true comic book Batman fan, then that says something about this movie.  "
134666,tt0405159,aeo,united states,9,Wow!,"I give this 9 stars out of 10. I usually do not give most movies anything above 7 because they just do not deserve it. Movies that are 8, 9, 10 have two things in common: great story and great performance. Every year, only a handful of movies, if at that, I believe deserve a score of 8 or above. The reason why I am discussing this is because I have friends who will be receiving their Academy ballots for the upcoming Oscar Awards and I hope some of them will give their vote to this movie. This movie is simply superb! Well written and very good performance. I cannot single out one person as standing out over others in this movie. Perhaps it is because you have three really good actors and actress who perform their craft so well that it seems effortless when you see them on the screen. The story! I mean, when I first heard the premise of this movie, I was simply turned off by it and did not watch it when it first came out in theaters. Big mistake. The saying, you cannot judge a book by its cover, is so true here. The movie is about a young woman (Hilary Swank) from a poverty background whose dream is to become a female boxer. She wants to train under a veteran trainer (Clint Eastwood) but he does not want to train her at first. The boxing gym's janitor (Morgan Freeman) gives her boxing advice so that she can train properly. Eventually, her perseverance wins out and the veteran trainer takes her under his tutelage. Things go well until tragedy strikes which causes the characters to evaluate what is truly important in their life. If this was simply a boxing story, I would give it no more than 6 stars. Thankfully it is not. Kudos to Rope Burns, F.X. Toole, and Paul Haggis, in bringing this story into creation. Further Kudos for director Clint Eastwood...the man is simply a juggernaut of talent. Seeing movies like this really makes all those other bad movies that I had watched throughout the year, bearable.  "
148787,tt0401792,aeo,united states,1,Disappointingly boring.,"I give this 1 star out of 10. I had high expectation when I saw this movie a couple of hours ago because of the high marks given by other reviewers but this movie sucks. In fact, I was so bored that I left the theater after viewing about 75% of the movie. I should have left earlier. The movie Sin City, as I understand it, was an adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller. For those of you who do not know who he is, this guy is huge in the comic book industry. Although I have not read this series, I understand that it was very popular with the readers. First, what I liked about the movie was that it was in black and white, for the most part, while using color for certain objects to magnify a certain scene. That's about it for the likes and now the dislikes. What I did not like about the movie was that it was not one story but multiple separate stories in the movie. The movie was basically stories about this make believe place called Sin City and the crimes that plagues it. This multiple story telling does not give enough time for one to understand the characters of one story before it ends and a new story begins. I think the reason for telling the story in this fashion was to give an overall look at Sin City as the main character in this story. It is an interesting way of telling a story but it was not well done. The only recent movie that I could remember that had similar multiple story telling in one movie was Animatrix, the animated movie about the story of the Matrix. Unlike Animatrix, however, Sin City just was not done well done. Given that the movie had to show multiple stories within a certain amount of time, some things had to be cut, and in this case it was character development. Each character was flimsy in their demeanor with no distinguishable characteristics. As for the violence, I know some IMDb viewers did not appreciate the movie because of it but I love gratuitous violence as long as it is placed correctly. However, violence cannot be rampant throughout the movie because then it looks silly and comical, which is exactly how it looked in this movie. As Eddie Murphy once said, his comedy routine is not simply a series of bad words alone, but that there is a story in his comedy routine and that he uses bad words simply to accentuate it. Food for thought for future story tellers.  "

A labor of love that all movie lovers are very grateful for. Even at such an extreme length when including the other two films. And even with all that was left out from the novels, especially Tom Bombadil. It is an achievement that should last forever. Even in my wildest dreams I never thought that it could look this good. Perhaps it doesn't pack the emotional wallop that the book does at times (see Eowyn's triumphant moment) but the visuals are so tremendous that you willingly overlook the minute negatives. All in all a tremendous achievement. I honestly believe that we'll never see the like again.  "
117985,tt2488496,Aeona Adastreia,philippines,6,A good weekend movie... but for a Star Wars movie? Err....,"Spoilers ahead. Taking down a powerful battle station through the oscillator? A youth whose potential with The Force runs strong? A masked villain wanting to take down the Resistance and change the ways of the galaxy? A dealer who Han Solo conveniently runs into in some strange looking pub? Why, that sounds exactly like what we saw and loved in the original trilogy. Only, this movie fails miserably in trying to bring forth to a new generation what was once, and still is, a classic series that should be enjoyed by all. I am very very late in joining the Star Wars wagon. It undeniably sparked my interest when The Force Awakens was about to come out and around that time, a fanart of one of my favorite characters in a certain fandom was drawn as a Jedi/lightsaber wielder. Downloading the Big Three (the original trilogy), I was charmed and hooked by this huge space opera with memorable characters. It is 2016, and I decide to try Episode VII: The Force Awakens, planning to watch The Phantom Menace and co., in a short while. We meet Rey, a scavenger in the desert planet of Jakku waiting for her family who'd left her all those years ago. She has an encounter with Finn, a stormtrooper who wishes to turn away from The First Order and dons the identity of a person from the Resistance (which still includes the characters we all loved from the original trilogy, General Leia Organa, C3PO, even R2-D2...) and comes upon a BB-8 droid model carrying information to the whereabouts of Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi knight from the era of the Empire. Only, the droid is sought out by Kylo Ren, a masked man who has his own ideals and is lured into the dark side of the force by Supreme Leader Snoke, a bald white organism that may just be human but will stop at nothing to get his way by obliterating the last of the Jedi... the fate of the galaxy rests on Rey's hands, as, the force is strong within her. Now, the bad part. It doesn't seem so bad, until you realize... it's been done before. Where the previous cast of characters from the original trilogy stand out and can stand up on their own and will be remembered for years to come is where the new cast of characters fail to shine through. One would argue that The Force Awakens should not be compared to the original trilogy. Thing is, it tries so hard to be what the original trilogy used to be that... it pulls itself down. Finn has faced trauma from all the blood shed throughout the galaxy under the influence of the First Order. Kylo Ren is shadowed by his past... and he wishes to continue what his grandfather, Darth Vader, started. Thing is, almost none of this is explored. We know that Kylo Ren is lured into the dark side of the force. But he is simply not an interesting, compelling character and we as viewers get close to no insight on his inner conflict. He slashes his light saber around and abuses his Jedi power - but that does not make him come off the least bit threatening. He just comes off very confused (which is, probably the film's intention and sort of backfires because we do not sympathize with him as much either. We're not meant to, but it's a possibility.) Rey is a shadow of Luke. She's adept at the force, she has a strong will, and she is a superb pilot. What bothered me the most about her was her duel with Kylo Ren at the end. The Force is meant to defend; never to attack. She is determined to defeat Kylo Ren. She did not undergo the rigorous training Luke did in The Empire Strikes Back. There is no one to train her in TFA, but she WILL be trained in Episode VIII! Is this saying she was lucky with disarming Kylo Ren? She's that good? It... just sounds a bit unlikely, don't you think? The power of determination and conviction does not always work out; and while it might in other movies, certainly not in Star Wars. Not when it's delivered this carelessly with the original trilogy backing up its current fame. What perhaps saves this movie and brings it down at the same time is the fact that it IS a Star Wars movie: Leia and Han, Chewbacca, R2- D2, C3PO, and a certain character's cameo at the end - there are parts that will surely warm your heart and make you think back to Star Wars' glory days. That being said, the graphics are very well done (it is Disney, after all). If you're new to the Star Wars franchise and are in need of a decent enough weekend movie (albeit forgettable), by all means, do try this. But do know that Star Wars is meant to be so much more than that, and nothing will ever replace the original trilogy.  "

To date best movie of 2012, and I don't see anything coming up in the remainder that should touch this.... Absolutely, beyond a shadow of doubt the best comic to movie experience yet. Nolan blew the last two films out of the water with this epic story of Gotham's hero. In an America overflowing with comic book turned movies, the Dark Knight trilogy has stood out with the first two films alone. With the third and final installment, Nolan cinched his place in the history of epic filming. Bale shone as the gritty, hard, and imperfectly human hero. Hathaway shone as the sexy, mesmerizing, mysterious Catwoman. Hardy bulky, intense, and terrifying as the best movie villain since Ledger in the first of this trifecta. All supporting characters blended together perfectly in a down and dirty platter of acting genius. Solid 10 out of 10.  "
125659,tt0469494,aequitas_veritas_007,united states,8,An American Epic,"The acting is second-to-none, the settings are realistic and beautiful, the characters are deep, but the story lacks a certain zest. The film is almost everything that I heard it to be, but watching the film, I found myself waiting for something to happen. I kept waiting for a certain something in the story that would entertain me as much as the characters themselves did. After a rather lengthy opening sequence with no dialog, the mood of the film is set fairly well. There are essentially two main characters clashing throughout, and mainly the whole movie is the will power of two men fighting. The movie itself is masterful simply by the mere scope of it all. Daniel Day Lewis once again sets himself as one of the absolute finest actors of my time. The rest of the cast are equally impressive. Paul Dano outstanding in his dual role, and until the story shows that they are two separate people, I believed the young man to be quite psychotic. Indeed the only place I find fault with this film is in the story itself. While I believe this to be an American Epic film, and would highly encourage a viewing from any movie lover, a single watch is plenty. 8/10 and I will not buy this on DVD or BluRay.  "

91486,tt2106476,aequus314,singapore,10,The narrative's genius embeds observer-effect with great accuracy ∂? unforgettable masterpiece.,"Consider first the setting. It may be quiet and idyllic, but merry laughter and droll humour open the scene. A group of middle-aged manboys are clowning around by the lake. They are long-time friends of The Hunt's central character, Lucas ∂? bespectacled 42 year old ex-professor, recently divorced and too old to be waddling in the water like a toddler at playtime. But the time is November in this unknown Danish village and everyone is having a good time in yet another get-together. Friends have known each other for years, people know people on a first name basis, many have lived here for generations and Lucas, is just another face in this jolly, close-knit community ∂? nondescript and mellow, respected and well-liked. We are told that Lucas (played with artful and refined precision by Mads Mikkelsen) is not without the woes that come with modern adult life. Living alone and seeking custody of teenage son Marcus (newcomer Lasse Fogelstr«˜m), he is an ordinary man trying to rebuild from ground up as a kindergarten teacher. Immediately you can see that he is kind and friendly because Lucas walks young Klara home, and chats with her father, also his best friend, Theo. The two men share lasagne while fussing over pet dogs and hunting rifles. You acknowledge that Lucas has earned his place in this neighbourhood and relationships are in complete accord. Then the maiming of his middle-class existence begins. Klara develops a schoolgirl crush and puerile gestures are sensibly rebuffed. Nothing unpredictable or startling at this point. You've heard of such awkward incidents before. But Lucas is then accused of something he did not commit because Klara said something to avenge an earlier rejection. This is where The Hunt succeeds with penetrating insights into social phenomenon ∂? soon after she causes harm, Klara attempts to recant the accusation without success. Here, writer-director Thomas Vinterberg absolves Klara from absolute blame and sets the stage for unreasonable and sinister conclusions. Watching the film from here on out is an unforgettable and riveting experience. It is natural to assume The Hunt simply alludes to the concept of ""Witch Hunt"", and contents itself with being dramatized fiction about falsely accusing the innocent. But if that were so, the brilliant scene where Klara was interviewed would not have alarmed with its disturbing methodology. The narrative's genius embeds observer-effect with great accuracy and insight into expectations of Klara, and her subsequent reaction. Vinterberg denies us simple solutions in which adults are perceptive enough to decipher the truth. For example, Ole the counsellor, ushered in from an unknown organization is scruffy and slightly unkempt. Characteristically unlikeable, he wears an implicit stereotype on his face and contaminates Klara's testimony by coaxing with a few hints, ""Do you remember, if something white came out?"" She stares blankly, yet revulsion grows and collective hysteria spreads ∂? allowing The Hunt to unveil itself as a carefully executed masterpiece. The clues match only because suggestive prompts are pushing the limits of disturbing reality. The canvas is visually precise; casting is pitch-perfect (especially that of Annika Wedderkopp in her excellent portrayal of Klara) and the script is cautiously penned. Based on transcripts of police interrogations conducted on suspected paedophiles in Denmark, the US and several European countries; Vinterberg investigates cause-effect with chilling authenticity. There is no doubt that The Hunt is antithesis to ""Festen"", an earlier work depicting the same subject matter but don't be mistaken ∂? this film does not involve itself with controversial material for the sake of obligatory endorsements. Relentless and intense plot is enriched by characters reacting with protective instincts that come naturally simply because they care for one another. We see the internal worlds of Lucas, Theo, Marcus and Klara, and observe the impact of rotten dynamic unfolding before our very eyes. This forces us, spectators with an omniscient view to sit-up and question judgement using rational exactitude. Short analysis of the ending >>> The Hunt is a superb, penetrating study of human agency and in the end, some mysteries remain unknowable. There are several narratives attempting to interpret the final scene, and who the shooter really is. This person may very well be the same culprit who killed Fanny. Is it Klara's older brother, who has demonstrated protectiveness over her? Perhaps a disgruntled retail assistant from the grocery store? Maybe a figment of Lucas's anxious imagination from knowing life can easily cast him from the status of a hunter to that of a prey? These questions continue to linger because The Hunt's technical finish is open-form and resists finite closure. The image of an unknown rifleman, indistinct and in hiding is a conveyor of figurative conclusions. By doing such, Vinterberg employs artistic device to suggest that attitudes may be outwardly placid, but remain violent and embittered covertly. Just as it is with real life, some hostility can't be neutralized and a malevolent presence continues to loom over the horizon, willing to perpetuate an abyss of moral panic. https://cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com  "

Entertaining!,"This film is fairly divisive and I'm aware of the naysayers that find those ""lame jokes trashy"", ""character development problematic"" and ""dialogue full of clich«∏s"". In defense of these three major complaints, I say well of course it's not the funniest film there is, but no less humorous than any other film in the superhero genre. Pretty damn entertaining on the overall and casting did a great job with Quill the Starlord. What I find earnest about this film, is James Gunn's intentional treatment of the space western being a different beast entirely from conventional superhero flicks. Whether in conscious revolt to self- important straight-up Marvel movies, OR mere satisfaction of style and whim consistent with career trajectory as an indie writer- director of B movies (Dawn of the Dead, Slither) I can't say with certainty. Maybe a combination of both. With that in mind, is James Gunn officially an auteur? Yes. Does being one also make him an artist? Maybe, maybe not. Anyway, considering Kubrick's axiom that ""a film is or should be, more like music than fiction."" I'm inclined to agree with all final verdicts that declare ""Guardians of the Galaxy being an unpretentious, fun and likable mess."" Too many cling to the naive belief that a movie rises and falls with character development ∂? not necessarily. While it is okay to care about character development, over insistence is to place too much emphasis on just one element and overlook the rest. What matters is the overall design works in favour of story material using suitable language. GotG is geared towards the edgy, cheeky and comical. Bunch of goofs and misfits become friends and save the galaxy.

But FOTR will always be first and best because of the amount of time it spends letting us get to know our hero, Frodo Baggins, played by the supremely talented Elijah Wood. Was there ever a more beautiful young man on the screen??? And Elijah weaves magic here in every one of his scenes. Whether he's laughing and having a good time, as he is at the beginning, or realizing that his comfortable world is about to drastically change, or reacting to danger, his facility with his expressions and emotions is beyond compare.

I was expecting a let down. However, this is not the case here in this masterpiece. At almost 3 hours in length, you would think it would be tedious, but it just flies by. Peter Jackson has done it!

I like CG effects, but it's great to see a film that doesn't rely on them for every background. I was in awe of all the visuals, everything from costuming to the props. My only problem was the movie's length. I really think a good half hour or more could been trimmed off the final cut. The extra footage is a treat for Tolkien fans, but for the newbies, like myself, it was too much. After a particular encounter in the cave with the steep stairway, I started estimating how much time was left to go. The action sequences were great and captivating, but the downtime made the movie hard to sit through. For me, LOTR is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen, but it was also the loudest movie I've ever heard. Maybe it was just the theater, but the sound effects were way too loud. I spent the last half of the movie with my left ear pressed into my hand to block out some of the noise. This probably contributed to my impatience towards the end.

64324,tt0095327,Aeris4ever,united states,10,Most heart-wrenching animated movie ever," ""Grave of the Fireflies"" is such a masterpiece, it's impossible for me to do it justice here. You just have to watch it. If you thought ""Bambi"" was sad, you'll be surprised with this movie. The story is of two siblings, Seita and his little sister Setsuko, and how their lives were affected during WWII. I think this movie will have a greater impact on younger viewers. My father, whose own father fought in WWII, didn't care for the movie and didn't get the message it was trying to get across. It doesn't focus on the war itself, but on two innocent children who are living in the midst of it. This is a very tragic film, as the viewer will know from the beginning. The movie begins by showing the childrens' demise; Seita has just died on the floor of a train station. A worker spots his empty candy container and throws it outside, releasing Setsuko's ashes. Her spirit appears and as she's about to run towards Seita's body, his own spirit joins her and the two are together again. From there, the spirits lead us through a flashback of how they helped each other and later died. It's like watching ""Titanic"", you know the ship's going to sink, but we get to see the events leading up to it. Don't pass up this gem just because it's animated. Honestly, I forgot it was animated at times, the characters are so real and so is their story. I don't think I'll ever see a more emotional, intelligent animated movie than this. A must-see!   "

Leon's greatest element is the reversal used in the narrative making the hitman an hero and the cops the enemies. the only real problem I have doesn't come from the film, but from what happens to the actors afterward. Jeno Reno ending up in parts like Rollerball and Natalie Portman acting in star wars. Not that I have a problem with star wars, yet her acting abilities are seriously restrained for that part. Leon does have major potential for a sequel which I hear may be in the works but at the same time I can see where it could ruin the narrative if not handled correctly.

Firth does not overly sweeten the character of George VI - he's certainly not a saint - but instead creates a character of stunningly real humanity. Indeed, I could have used a few more scenes on how Elizabeth handled her husband's temper. Geoffrey Rush is excellent, as always, as is Helena Bonham Carter in a slightly less Gothic turn than is her wont. The personal crisis of the king is so skillfully interwoven with the impending political crisis that one really feels something of what George must have felt, especially with his wastrel brother's abandoning the ship of state. YES, there is the inspiring ending you would expect, but every bit of it is earned. I recommend this movie with great enthusiasm. If only royals really looked like Colin Firth..  "
75660,tt0112573,aero_nut (aero_nut@go.com),united states,10,Spellbinding," To say the absolute least I was speechless at the end of this movie. Its not perfect, but so close its scary. I have this listed as my #2 movie. (I can't seem to find a number 1) Based on actual events, (with the exception that princess Isabella was really a toddler when this was going on). It takes a hold of you by the shirt and dosen't let go until the last line is spoken. The 3 hours it takes to watch this film is well deserved. Supurbly cast and acted, and not only by Gibson. But I believe the supporting deserves a standing ovation.  Sophie Marceu looks like a princess even when she doesn't have to play one. She is so poised and proper, statuesqe almost. And plays a woman who is not loved by the man she married, which is all she wants, to be loved.  Angus Macfaden was brilliant as Robert the Bruce, a man torn between what he knows is right and doing what he has to do to stay loyal to his titles and family name.  David O'hara as Stephen. The crazy Irishman who saves Wallaces life on several occasions, he really brought the charator to life.  Brendan Gleeson also did well as Hamish, Wallaces childhood buddy and one of his right hand men.  Randall Wallace the script writer did an exceptional job by not concentrating on one thing too much. It wasn't constantly serious, the romance was there but not overly exploited and the comedy that pops out at the oddest times. And though the blood shed was tremendous it was tastefully done, for the story line reminds us constantly of the tyranny and persecution these people were facing, therefore making the slaughter seem more justified. I recommend this movie to everyone. Unless youre a movie critic and get paid to, You cant find much wrong with this movie.      "
12880,tt0110912,aero2558,united states,9,More of a question than a review........,"9 of 10 'nough said from my point of view. Comparables would be Band of Brothers, No Country for Old Men, Good Fellas and the entire Sopranos Series - for reference. The question is - I'm looking for a poster, I have some awesome ones, I'm not a collector and they are in a portion of my house where they are rarely seen - they just gotta be good - make me smile. At any rate - I've seen a cartoony one with Jules and Vincent that is pretty great, but I've seen one by Tarantino w/ all characters in cartoon(not sure what the appropriate term would be) that is AWESOME. Is that out there for sale or is it some Holy Grail that I will never ever find? Anyone know?  "
8191,tt0468569,aerock19,united states,10,The Dark Knight lives up to the Hype and Exceeds even the Loftiest Expectations,"Since the first time I saw 'The Dark Knight' teaser attached to 'Knocked Up' last spring, I couldn't stop thinking about the film. With unprecedented hype and speculation, the latest Batman adaption has created the loftiest expectations for millions of people (fanboys and moviegoers alike); myself included. After seeing an advanced screening of 'The Dark Knight', I can honestly say: 'The Dark Knight' is amazing. 'The Dark Knight' left me breathless. 'The Dark Knight' is the best Batman movie to date. Christopher Nolan's latest film, without a single doubt, dethrones Tim Burton's 'Batman' and his own 'Batman Begins'. It's immense, unpredictable, and believable. Nolan's 'The Dark Knight' transcends the ""superhero"" genre. The IMAX format is absolutely beautiful. Do yourself a favor and go see 'The Dark Knight' in IMAX if available to you. There were moments during the picture where the IMAX-specific sequences left me speechless. It was unreal. It made the cinema-experience that much better (though I'm nearly positive that IMAX or not, you'll still love this film!) The last thing I'd like to mention is the wonderful acting in 'The Dark Knight'; specifically Heath Ledger, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman. Their respective performances were uncanny. Ledger's portrayal of The Joker is outstanding and deserves the praise he's been receiving from many early reviews. Eckhart is excellent and showcases his multi-talented abilities through the movie; I believe in Harvey Dent. Oldman's role as Jim Gordon was a personal favorite of mine, and I left the theater in amazement. To avoid spoiling anything to you, I must admit to you that my review is only scratching the surface. I loved this movie! Great work; Great film. "
93540,tt0372784,aerock19,united states,9,Interesting and Intelligent Version of the Dark Knight,"I have been a huge fan of the Batman series since I first started watching the old Adam West version on FX when I was younger. I have seen all four Warner Motion Pictures, watched the Animated Series, and also have read quite a few of the comics. I have felt that Batman's legacy and popularity has declined over the years, thanks to the horrible 'Batman and Robin'flick and the rise of 'X-Men' and 'Spider Man.' With that said, Nolan's 'Batman Begins' gives all of the Batman fans a promising sign of things to come. 'Begins' gives a realistic, dark, yet enjoyable atmosphere for both the young and older viewer. The music score is dead on, the cinematography allows the viewer to believe that Gotham City could be a metropolis in the US (unlike the overly comic book look like the past two; even Burton's surreal Gotham), and the acting, for the better majority, is pretty damn good. The fight scenes are fast paced thanks to the intelligent editing, the villains are just as real as Batman and the people of Gotham. No mutants, no freak accidents; all of the characters are real people. That's what I love about this film, the realism which usually cannot be found in a comic book film. There are a few campy moments/lines which seem to be put in the film in ode to the comic-book hero genre, but these scenes are speckles compared to the crap in the previous Batman films. I have a few questions and gripes with Bale's Batman voice (why does he talk like that?), the believability of Katie Holmes (I still see her as that girl from Dawson's Creek), and the decision by Batman to willingly let (here is the SPOILER*, but I'm not going to go into details) Ra'z Al Guhl die at the end. But these blemishes are outweighed by the many success which are produced through the carefully crafted film which is 'Batman Begins.' Oldeman, Freeman, Caine, and Neeson are arguably the best characters/actors ever found in the franchise. Bale plays the role of Bruce Wayne very well, and he actually comes close to par with Michael Keaton's Batman. By the way, Bale looks sick in the movie!(he's completely jacked...all of my friends wanted to look like him after the film). The batmobile is by far the coolest vehicle in comic book film history, and the plot twists and attention to detail are superb. Go see 'Batman Begins,' because this ISN'T your typical Batman film. Can't wait to see the Joker in the sequel! (SPOILER*).  "
56844,tt0209144,aerodoe,united states,1,Unbearable!," Although I love all the actors in this film, I found it insufferable to watch. The story is weak. I believe that the appeal to some people for this movie might be the challenge of figuring out what the heck is going on. The editing makes it a bit confusing, but there are physical clues to guide you. If you liked ""the Spanish Prisoner"" (another DULLSville film) you will love this movie. I found it boring and contrived.  "
35701,tt0102926,AeroJeen,united states,9,Best Suspense Movie Ever Made!," This is the most intriguing study into the mind of a psychopath I've ever seen. The performances are astounding (how can you go wrong with Hopkins and Foster?) and deserve Oscar nominations for the next 20 years for this movie! The only thing that was missing - probably intentionally so - was insight into how Lecter became Lecter. I would love to know. I still watch this movie at least once every 6 months or so, just to get captivated all over again. Some people can't watch it alone. I'm not one of them.  "
136536,tt1028532,Aeromaxx777,philippines,10,A rare kind of love not not expressed by humans,"This movie really made me cry for quite a long time. I somehow believed that the greatest love of all is not expressed by humans. Hachi waited for his deceased master for more or less 9 years and never gave up even though professor Wilson was dead. How many people do you think can wait forever for someone special to them? I admit I'm incapable of doing that. The story of how Hachi found Mr. Wilson may be unrealistic to some people since as if destiny brought them together, I wouldn't say anything negative about it or any of the flaws(if there is any) that critics may notice in this film. The way the master and his dog were finally reunited in heaven really warms even the coldest of hearts. In closing; to all the people reading this review, ""Never forget those who you love so dearly; because they will never forget you"".  "
65686,tt1345836,aerophex,united states,8,First viewing from a Marvel fan,"So I just finished my first watching. I'm a self admitted Avengers fan, and all the Nolandoids attacking that board held me off on viewing. Kinda sad I did. I never liked TDK, I admit. The character of The Joker never seemed real in my mind. Too nuts, no one would 'really' follow along with him / his plans. I quickly got disconnected, and lost interest. I find chaos for the sake of chaos rather boring. Bane was a menacing brute, and his fight with Bats in the sewer scared me. His whole breaking of the Bat was masterful. Fantastic sequence. This villain I could connect with. He had some kind of back story, and plan for the future. I think that, knowing the whole time, Miranda was the child (movie was spoiled long ago) actually increased my enjoyment. The movie kinda hinted that Bane was not the child, and that all along Bruce was just assuming it. But really, it wasn't that hard to figure out. I thought the relationship between Bane and Talia was awesome, and Bane really was bad ass. He was doing all this not at Talia's command, no, but the two of them were in this as one. Bane goes out of his way throughout the movie to protect her. He's just a big softy. The look he gives her before she leaves says it all. two words for Matthew Modine: completely useless The end chase scene in The Bat was exciting. Lots of good CGI / effects The movie was reminiscent of a few others: Iron Man, various James Bond films, while keeping itself contained in its' own universe. The cameo by Cillian Murphy and his court was real icing, IMO. Plus add a dash of Liam Neeson and you usually can't go wrong. The minor 'plot holes' I don't mind overlooking, I watch a movie to be entertained, not wonder why the cops don't have thick beards. Although I don't really get why Bruce was so nice to Selina when he first came back, she WAS the one who betrayed him. He could have found a half dozen ways to get to Fox. That bugged me. And seriously? Comparing this to Avengers? Such different visions of movies. People who say one is better than the other really are comparing Apples to Oranges. I know which movie I prefer, but that is not the point of this post. A little over-reaching perhaps, I think this movie could have been 4 hours if Nolan wanted it to. IMO, anytime you change seasons in a movie, people will complain that it is ""too long"". If this were another franchise, they would have made two movies here (3 maybe? derp Hobbit. Sorry, a little bitter about that (/tangent)) In the end, I think the BO #'s prove there is enough room in the summer lineup for 2 billionaires in expensive suits saving the city from a very large bomb.

32730,tt0047478,aerovertice,united states,10,An artistic action flick,"Seven Samurai is an artistic action flick, if that makes any sense. It is made by one of the most revered and legendary film-makers of all time: Akira Kurosawa. Kurosawa is one of those rare film makers who can strike a wonderful balance between art and entertainment, and no movie of his displays that fact better than Seven Samurai. Seven Samurai is the story of a group of seven Samurai (maybe not exactly seven) who are hired by farmers to defend their village from the marauding bandits. It is set in 16th Century Japan, period in history when feudalism was breaking apart, and many of the formerly employed Samurai were out on the streets, roaming around as free ronins. Many Samurai adopted the role of bandits and took to pillaging villages. It is against this backdrop that Seven Samurai is set, and as a result, it is able to touch upon a lot of the issues of social conflict between the farmers and the Samurai; as it ironically turns out, the Samurai are both the perpetrators and the protectors of the villagers. Although set against a serious social backdrop, the movie is, nevertheless, filled with humor and thrilling excitement. The plot is extremely involving; as an audience member, you feel as though you are right there with the others, as though you are the eighth samurai, taking part in all the mapping and the planning. The characters are all very diverse and complement each other perfectly. The star of the show, however, is Kikuchiyo, played by Toshiro Mifune, who lights up the screen with his clownish antics; although a seeming lunatic, he turns out to be the string that binds all the elements together, not just within the groupof Samurai, but also within the entire village. Running at a whopping 3 ∂´ hours, the length may discourage some from viewing Seven Samurai, but trust me, as you watch this movie, time will fly by.  "
73390,tt0053125,aerovertice,United States,10,"Entertaining, to say the least...","A few days ago, I had watched this movie again after many years; it was during one of the weekly screenings for a film class that I am taking, and it is the only movie this semester which not a single person walked out on (which is understandable, since we had to watch movies like Sergei Eisenstein's ""October"" and Lois Weber's ""Hypocrites"" throughout the semester). North by Northwest may be the most entertaining movie Hitchcock ever made, and that is a big deal when you consider how thoroughly entertaining all of Hitchcock's movies are. North by Northwest is not the most artistic endeavor from the master; in fact, Hitchcock had deliberately set out to make the movie as commercial as possible, without of course compromising on the quality. And that brings us to the question: does quality equate to being artistic? This movie proves that the answer is no. The production quality is crisp, the acting is very competent, and the direction is, as always, great: in short, it is an extremely well crafted movie that leaves the audience fully satisfied and content. The thing that I love most about this movie is the incredible humor, one that reflects the personal sense of humor of Hitchcock. The movie gets into bouts of extremely tense and thrilling moments, and the humor comes in at the perfect moments to give the audience a sense of relief. The movie is a roller-coaster ride of thrill and laughter, but it is entertaining all the way throughout. Ian Fleming, the writer and creator of the James Bond novels, is said to have been inspired by this movie, having based the character of James Bond on that of Cary Grant in North by Northwest. If only the Bond movies were half as good as this movie∂?  "
